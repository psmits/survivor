<p>Understanding the differential extinction of taxa is one of the primary goals of paleobiology. While periods of high intensity extinction have received the majority of attention, these events only represent a fraction of the total fossil record. Here, various factors which might contribute to the longevity of taxa are compared under a unified framework in order to estimate the extinction risk associated with various adaptive zones.</p>
<p>Genera can be thought of as gamblers, with their constituent species being their betting pieces. Given infinite time a gambler will eventually loose all their money, regardless of the odds. What is important is how long it takes the average genus to go &quot;bust&quot; (extinct). By comparing the durations of genera based on their properties as well as the properties of their constituent species, it should be possible to determine which traits &quot;tip the scales&quot; of extinction risk.</p>
<p>Extinction risk is analyzed in a parametric survival analytical framework based on the distribution of taxonomic durations. The Australian record of brachiopods in the Permian is analyzed because it represents a relatively complete and well worked sequence. During the Permian, the east coast of Australia faced the Panthalassic and might have represented a partially isolated biogeographic province. The factors of interest are substrate and environmental preference, body size, and biogeographic occupancy.</p>
