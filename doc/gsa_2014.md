Gambling with Australian brachiopods
------------------------------------

Understanding the differential extinction of taxa is one of the primary goals of
paleobiology. 
Extinction can be thought of as a Gambler's Ruin type process, with the eventual
disappearance of a taxon being inevitable regardless of the odds of "winning" or
"losing". What is of interest, instead, is how long it takes for a gambler to "go
bust". We can imagine a genus as a "gambler" with its constituent species as
betting pieces. How long it takes the genus to "go bust," or the expected 
duration, is in part affected by properties of the genus and its constituent 
species. By comparing genera with similar properties to those with different, it
is possible to estimate how differences in adaptive zone may "tip the scales" of 
generic extinction risk.

Using the Australian record of Permian brachiopods, I analyzed the effect of 
factors such as such as substrate and habitat preference, body size, and 
biogeographic occupancy on taxonomic durations in a parametric survival 
analytical framework. Substrate and habitat preference measured as the 
probability of occurrence in a given category while occupancy was estimated 
using a biogeographic network approach where modules are determined by 
taxon-locality association. This particular fossil sequence was chosen because 
it represents a relatively complete and well-worked sequence. During the Permian
the east coast of Australia faced the Panthalassic Ocean and may have 
represented a partially isolated biogeographic province. This allows for the 
estimation of specific selective differences associated with the regional, as 
opposed to global, environment (*sensu* Simpson). In addition to biogeographic 
occupancy, the inclusion of factors unique to the different taxa greatly 
improves the model of taxon duration. This implies that extinction is 
brachiopods does not completely follow a Field of Bullets mode, but is instead 
at least partially selective with respect to biology.
