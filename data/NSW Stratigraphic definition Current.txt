25684|Anembo Granodiorite|Unit history|Baker (1915) referred to the Jerangle Grey Granite but most later workers combined the references to the Anembo Granodiorite and the Towners Creek Adamellite under the one name until Richards (1967) introduced the name Round Hill Ganodiorite (invalidated by Andrews' (1922) Round Hill Group).|
25684|Anembo Granodiorite|Type section locality|South of Anembo at GR 192336 near the Queanbeyan River.|
25684|Anembo Granodiorite|Description at type locality|The granodiorite is a texturally homogeneous, coarse-grained, xenolith-enriched biotite-hornblende granodiorite. It generally has a coarse, hypidiomorphic granular texture. It weathers to a creamy-grey colour. Xenoliths up to 20 cm2 in area are common.|
25684|Anembo Granodiorite|Extent|It appears along the full length of the Jerangle Igneous Complex, mainly along the eastern side. Size: 220 km2.|
25684|Anembo Granodiorite|Relationships and boundaries|The granodiorite is partially bounded by the minor phase of the Jerangle Igneous Complex (Towners Creek Adamellite) and Late Ordovician Foxlow Beds. Some contact metamorphism is present.|
25684|Anembo Granodiorite|Age reasons|A revised age of 396 m.y. is suggested by J Richards (pers. comm.). This suggests a Siluro-Devonian time of intrusion.|

1444|Belubula Limestone|Identifying features|Definition: The informal 'Middle Member' of Webby (1969) was named the Boonderoo Limestone Member by Osborne (1978). However, use of the name must be abandoned because the 'Boonderoo Beds' of the Lower Permian of the Hughenden area, Queensland (Vine & Paine, 1974) has priority. No type section was designated by Osborne (1978). Instead, it is proposed to reinstate Carne and Jones" (1919, p.177) name 'Belubula Limestone Belt', a name which has remained unused for more than 50 years. Carne & Jones originally indicated the name to apply to the 'extensive belt of limestone outcrops' exposed on both sides of the Belubula River from the junction with Limestone Creek downstream (west) for a distance of 2.5 miles (4 km). The most conspicuous outcrops along this sector are the massively-bedded, 290 m thick, middle part of the Cliefden Caves Limestone Group. It is therefore proposed to use their name, modified to 'Belubula Limestone', for the middle of the three constituent formations of the Cliefden Caves Limestone Group. The name derives from the Belubula River, along the banks of which, between Limestone Creek and Copper Mine Creek, some of the best outcrop is found. The type section will be designated in forthcoming publication as composite, including the section on Dunhill Bluff (GR 753815*) through the lower half, and the section on the north-west flanks of Caves Hill (GR 753821*) through the upper half. In the composite type section a total of 290 m of Belubula Limestone is represented. No mappable subdivisions have yet been recognised as extending across the area.

1466|Bendethera Limestone Member|Unit history|The name Bendethera Limestone, presumably of formational status, was introduced by Best et al. (1964, Canberra 1:250 000 Geological Map, 2nd ed.). No formal definition has ever been published. Our mapping on the Araluen 1:100 000 sheet has demonstrated that it is best regarded as a limestone lense developed in the De Drack Formation (defined on Braidwood 1:100 000 Sheet) and of member status. A formal definition is given below.|

40754|Bideroie Ignimbrite Member|Lithology|Three lithologies are represented in this composite member ; dacitic ignimbrite (sample G13 Table 1 Appendix 3) , rhyodacitic ignimbrite (sample G14 Table 1 Appendix 3) and rhyodacitic breccia (sample G12 Table 1 Appendix 3). The dacitic ignimbrite is unwelded, dark grey, with plagioclase, hornblende, ? pumice fragments in a shard-rich, glassy, micropoikilitic or spherulitic groundmass. The rhyodacitic ignimbritic is slightly welded, purple to red, with scattered feldspars and pumice fragments in a shard-rich matrix. The breccia, which is confined to the type area, is red to beige and contains sub-rounded to angular clasts of felsic ignimbrite up to 20 mm in diameter. In thin section the matrix is ferruginised and contains smaller angular fragments and shards. In the type area the breccia is separated from the succeeding dacite by conglomerate, siltstone and sandstone.|

24181|Big Hole Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Conformably on Gundillion Conglomerate, with a gradational contact, and where the Conglomerate is absent, unconformably on the Silurian Long Flat Volcanics. The Big Hole Formation passes laterally southwards into the Long Swamp Creek Formation, and differs from the latter by having a much higher arenite/shale ratio, and in the arenites being coarser. The top of the Big Hole Formation is formed by the present-day erosion surface.|
24181|Big Hole Formation|Age reasons|Several fossil localities are known in the north of the area; poorly preserved brachiopods and bivalves indicatae a Late Devonian age.|

39258|Birken Head Volcanic Member|Lithology|Composite unit of dacitic ignimbrite, subordinate and localised dacite lava, and resedimented dacitic conglomerate and/or agglomerate and sandstone. Predominant rock-type beige, white, pink or grey, coarse to medium-grained, crystal-rich, unwelded to moderately welded ignimbrite with quartz, plagioclase, K-feldspar, biotite, opaque minerals and minor pumices; groundmass generally spherulitic to occasionally micropoikilitic. A flow unit in upper part of member in section 578 (578-21) contains scattered medium grained plagioclase within a fine groundmass of oriented plagioclase laths and minor quartz. Glass shards normally present in resedimented rocks. Pumiceous conglomerate overlies the ignimbrite west of Birken Head Rock. XRF analyses (Liang 1989, MU47992, MU47993; Geeve 1995, MU55267, MU55268 and MU55269) indicate compositions of rhyolite at the base to dacite throughout the remainder of the unit.|
39258|Birken Head Volcanic Member|Relationships and boundaries|A thin tongue of dacitic ignimbrite and, at the northern end of Tulcumba, a dacite flow (unnamed unit Cw9 of Roberts et al. in press) projects northwards from the main body of the Birken Head Volcanic Member in the central part of Tulcumba Ridge. The dacitic ignimbrite and lava are separated from the main body of the member by a lens of volcanolithic sediments and minor  volcanics.|

24744|Bombay Volcanics|Lithology|Grey-green medium-grained dacitic crystal tuff; rhyolite, rhyolitic ignimbrite. Minor shale, siltstone, lithic sandstone.|
24744|Bombay Volcanics|Relationships and boundaries|In the northern area of their outcrop, the Bombay Volcanics are faulted against the Boro Granite and Palerang Formation in the west and against the Long Flat Volcanics in the east. Further south the volcanics are intruded by the Boro Granite and are overlain to the west with apparent conformity by Palerang Formation sediments. The top of the volcanics is defined as the top of the last massive outcrop of crystal tuff. No volcanics are included in the Palerang Formation. South of the Braidwood sheet area, the Bombay Volcanics appear to overlie the Long Flat Volcanics, possibly disconformably. In this area, a topographic break occurs between the softer, more weathered crystal tuffs of the Long Flat Volcanics and the compositionally similar, but more massive rocks of the Bombay Volcanics.|
24744|Bombay Volcanics|Age reasons|The volcanics are intruded by the Boro Granite (mid-Early Devonian) which establishes a minimum age. No fossils have been found in the overlying Palerang Formation, or in the Bombay and Long Flat Volcanics. The Bombay Volcanics are tentatively correlated with the Woodlawn Volcanics further north, which interfinger with De Drack Formation sediments containing Monograptus cf. bohemicus, a late Silurian graptolite. The Long Flat Volcanics conformably overlie De Drack Formation sediments and limestone containing non-diagnostic fossils of Silurian age. A tentative age of Middle to Late Silurian is assumed.|

2344|Boro Granite|Name source|Boro village, GR 424078, Braidwood 1:100 000 sheet.|
2344|Boro Granite|Type section locality|Fresh pink granite is exposed by the roadside on the Goulburn-Braidwood road 3 km south of Boro. Texture is coarse grained equigranular, with mafic minerals occurring as small aggregates 5 mm in diameter, slightly streaked into cleavage. Xenoliths are rare at this locality but can be seen in the tor-like outcrops in the vicinity of Reedy Creek where it is crossed by the road (GR 425995, Braidwood 1:100 000 sheet).|
2344|Boro Granite|Extent|The Boro Granite is batholithic in character. Disconnected bodies extend from just north of Lake Bathurst (GR 455180, Braidwood 1:100 000 sheet) to the southern edge of the Canberra 1:250 000 sheet and beyond, where it becomes part of the Bega Batholith, an undifferentiated, composite granitic intrusion. The area in which it crops out is at least 120 km long and 20 km wide.|
2344|Boro Granite|Lithology|The Boro Granite consists of hornblende biotite granodiorite and adamellite, pink to grey in colour. It is intruded by basic dykes, particularly near Reedy Creek (GR 425995, Braidwood 1:100 000 sheet) and by bodies of microgranite with quartz phenocrysts (exposed by the roadside 5 km south of Boro).|
2344|Boro Granite|Relationships and boundaries|The Boro Granite intrudes Ordovician metasediments, Middle to Late Silurian volcanics and sediments (Long Flat and Bombay Volcanics; De Drack Formation, Palerang Formation) and is unconformably overlain by the Early Devonian Tarago Conglomerate and Cainozoic sediments. Faulted against the Long Flat and Bombay Volcanics. Intrudes the ?Early Silurian Lockhart igneous complex.|

27117|Boyd Volcanic Complex|Type section locality|There is no type section, as the unit is a complex of interdigitating facies. Ten sections through the unit have been measured and will be published to illustrate the variations.|
27117|Boyd Volcanic Complex|Extent|The unit is exposed over approximately 300 km2 parallel to the Pacific Coastline in the Bega 1:250 000 Metallogenic map (1975) from Bunga Head to the Victorian Border.|
27117|Boyd Volcanic Complex|Thickness range|Variable: measured sections vary from 120 m to 1500 m.|
27117|Boyd Volcanic Complex|Lithology|Eight facies have been identified: (1) Sedolithic breccia-conglomerate-sandstone facies, (2) Flyschoid facies, (3) Arkosic-volcolithic conglomerate-sandstone mudstone facies, (4) Banded rhyolite facies, (5) Lenticle-tuff facies, (6) Massive rhyolite facies, (7) Basalt facies, and (8) Massive, granular rhyolite-aplite facies.|
27117|Boyd Volcanic Complex|Relationships and boundaries|Overlies Ordovician (?) Mallacoota Beds (Steiner, 1972) with high angle unconformity, and is non-conformable on the Bega granitoids. The top is a low-angle unconformity with the base of the Upper Devonian Merrimbula Group (Steiner, 1972). The Gabo Island Granite is intrusive into, and comagmatic with the rhyolitic facies. Revision of old terms: The Boyd Volcanic Complex includes all the rocks formerly sub-divided into the "Eden Rhyolite" and "Lochiel Formation" (Hall, 1960), which two formations are rejected as being invalid because they are not mappable units.|
27117|Boyd Volcanic Complex|Age reasons|Probably Upper Devonian. Upper Devonian fish fossils have been found in mudstones within the complex (G. Young, pers. comm.), Upper Devonian plant fossils have been recovered from the overlying Merrimbula Group. A K/Ar date from the Gabo Island Granite (356 +/- 12 m.y., Thompson, 1974) is also Upper Devonian. No Middle or Lower Devonian fossils have been found, but the older time bracket can be established no more precisely than post-Bega Granitoids from which a K/Ar date of 376 m.y. (Evernden & Richards, 1962) has been obtained.|

24203|Bungendore Formation|Unit history|None.|
24203|Bungendore Formation|Type section locality|Designated from core in BMR stratigraphic hole C354 (Abell 1985a). From the surface 54m of clay and silt was recovered (mostly in excess of 90%) from the greatest thickness of the formation so far drilled in the Lake George Basin.  The base is defined by thin beds of dark-greenish-grey to medium-grained sand and silt at the top of the Ondyong Point Formation. Representative outcrops of clay occur at the drier northern and southern extremities of Lake George.|
24203|Bungendore Formation|Extent|Lake George drainage basin (Canberra 1:100 000 sheet 8727). The unit immediately underlies the present lake bed.|
24203|Bungendore Formation|Thickness range|Maximum known is 54m in BMR stratigraphic hole C354.|
24203|Bungendore Formation|Lithology|Consists of three lithotypes: mottled clay; gravelly clay with quartz and lithic clasts; clay with colour, carbonaceous or silty laminations.  Reddish-brown ferriginous weathering profiles occur intermittently throughout.  The unit is characterised by montmorillonite, montmorillonitic mixed clays and detrital kaolinite (Abell, 1985b).|
24203|Bungendore Formation|Depositional environment|Lacustrine.|
24203|Bungendore Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The base is not exposed but is taken at the top of the highest and most persistent sandbed of the Ondyong Point Formation. The top of the formation is the lake bed which is exposed when Lake George dries out. The upper part of the formation grades laterally into coarse alluvium in embayments at the southern and eastern margin of the basin. Westward it grades laterally into colluvium and alluvial fans at the base of the Lake George escarpment.|
24203|Bungendore Formation|Age reasons|A study of palaeomagnetic reversals through the upper 36m of the formation in ANU hole LG4 gives a Pliocene age of 3.5Ma (Singh and other 1981). A similar and probably greater age can be extrapolated to the thicker lacustrine sequence in BMR stratigraphic hole C354.|
24203|Bungendore Formation|Correlations|The upper part of the formation presumably correlates with the Late Quarternary colluvial, alluvial strandline and lagoonal sediments in marginal areas of the Lake George drainage basin; also with fluviolacustrine sediments on the Carwoola Flats: perched drainage basin associated with the Murrumbidgee River on the Tuggeranong and Lanyon areas south of Canberra, and Plio-Pleistocene sediments in the Lake Bathurst drainage basin.|
3060|Burcher Greywacke|Name source|Village of Buracher.|
3060|Burcher Greywacke|Type section locality|Type Section and Lithology: This unit is about 4000 m thick and consists, except for the Blow Clear Member, of a very uniform massive medium grained grey quartz-feldspar-biotite greywacke. It is silicified in many places and forms hills with extensive outcrops. Bedding is generally not prominent in the greywacke but there is overall variation in grain size from dark slate to grit. In places it is calcareous or dolomitic, and a few rare crinoid stems have been found within the massive greywacke. The type section for the formation, including the Blow Clear Member, is along an east-west line through Lake View homestead. Here the succession is as follows: a. The basal 1500 m of the formation is generally fine grained and slaty.  b. Blow Clear Member - Immediately to the west of Lake View there is a hill subsurface, about 200 m thick and lenses out to the north. Overlying the sandstone but separated from it by alluvium and soil, there is a 50 m thick unit of cobble and pebble conglomerate. The cobbles and pebbles are well rounded and consist of quartzite. The conglomerate lenses out to the north. To the south it grades into sandstones and shales.  c. To the west, i.e. stratigraphically above, of the conglomerate there is a wide interval of soil and alluvium. However it is marked as a magnetic ridge on aeromagnetic maps and probably indicates an andesitic volcanic rock in the subsurface. d. Further west, towards the Burcher-West Wyalong road, there is almost continuous outcrop of the monotonous quartz greywacke. Although the Blow Clear Member is a prominent part of the Burcher Formation in the south, towards the north the Member sharply lenses out. The contact between the Burcher Greywacke and the overlying Sandal Formation is nowhere exposed; the two formations are separated by soil and alluvium.  534844 (bottom) to 527845 (top) Forbes 1:250 000.|

24205|Calamia Member|Relationships and boundaries|RDEF: The member is apparently conformable with bounding units. It separates the Gatton Sandstone of the Marburg Subgroup from the Ripley Road Sandstone.

24205|Calamia Member|Age reasons|The member contains no internal evidence of age. The Marburg Subgroup is Early Jurassic in age and the basal parts of the Subgroup, probably including strata equivalent to the Calamia Member, contain the upper limit of the basal Early Jurassic P. crenulatus zone. The Ripley Road Sandstone beneath is Upper Triassic in NS 272 Ipswich, and in GSQ Ipswich 1 the uppermost part of the sandstone is in the lower part of Assemblage C, and thus is probably latest Triassic.|03/DEC/09

3385|Camden Head Claystone|Name source|Camden Head 31deg38' 48.56"S, 152deg50' 24.81"E. The Camden Head Claystone is named after Camden Head where the first outcrop of Triassic rocks in the Lorne Basin was identified by Carne (1897). The formation was formally named by Pratt and Herbert (1973) who nominated, with a single grid reference, the Bago Road exposure south from Kings Creek as the type section because more of the unit was exposed there than at Camden Head. They also noted that the unit `usually, although not always, has a thin basal conglomerate and the `conglomerate is identical in composition to the overlying Laurieton Conglomerate. The latter part of this observation is now shown herein to be incorrect.|27/SEP/11
3385|Camden Head Claystone|Unit history|Named by Pratt & Herbert 1973|
3385|Camden Head Claystone|Geomorphic expression|Usually gently undulating terrain without outcrop and having a rich reddish soil. The presence of the Camden Head Claystone is usually suggested by undulating terrain without outcrop and the deep, usually rich red soil developed over it. There is often a noticeable change of slope and change in soil colour at the boundary of the formation and the overlying, more-resistant, Coorabakh Conglomerate. The Coopernook Conglomerate Member has a different geomorphic expression as described below.|27/SEP/11

The type section now proposed for this formation is located more precisely than the original site nominated by Pratt and Herbert (1973). The Camden Head Claystone type section is now specified as along Bago Road from GR 474286 6512671 (1:25 000 map sheet 9434-4-N, Byabarra; location 26) to GR 473623 6511952 (1:25 000 map sheet 9434-4-N, Byabarra; location 23).

3385|Camden Head Claystone|Description at type locality|The type section for the Camden Head Claystone is exposed in road cuttings on the eastern side
of the Bago Road southwards up the hill from near the Kings Creek Bridge. The Camden Head
Claystone is an upward-fining sequence from pebble and granule conglomerate at the base,
through sandstone to siltstone and claystone at the top. While these lithologies are interbedded in
various proportions, the conglomerates are confined to the lower part of the formation. To provide more precise locations for the top and base of the section, the exposure was reassessed and measured. Bed lithology analysis of the 82 m thick Bago Road section has indicated an overall lithological composition of: conglomerate 16%; sandstone 21%; mudstone 63%. The sequence fines upward, with rudaceous sedimentary rocks dominating the basal 32 m, where the components are: conglomerate 41%; sandstone 17%; mudstone 42%. This basal 32 m unit contains a variety of interbedded lithologies from pebble (occasional cobble bands in some locations) conglomerate through sandstone to mudstone  although the unit is dominated by conglomerate and sandstone. This basal unit has both a lihology and topographic expression distinctly different to the upper part of the formation and so, as a mappable unit, is separated as a new member It is herein defined as the Coopernook Conglomerate Member of the Camden Head Claystone. The base of the Camden Head Claystone, being the base of its Coopernook Conglomerate Member, is defined as the bed which rests on the Jolly Nose Conglomerate, as at location 21 or the Palaeozoic rocks of the basin floor as at location 202. The top of the unit is the top of the reddish purple mudstone on which the Laurieton Conglomerate rests. A graphical reference for the lithology of measured sections are presented in Figure 4. The graphical representation for the lithology of the type section of the Camden Head Claystone (location 26 to location 23), is presented in Figure 5.|

3385|Camden Head Claystone|Lithology|The Camden Head Claystone is dominated by grey and reddish purple mudstone. The formation
is readily identified by that reddish purple mudstone, which is absent from the other Triassic units. Some of the reddish purple mudstone weathers to grey while the grey mudstone may weather to, or be stained, reddish purple. The reddish purple mudstone is very well-developed in the upper part of the sequence and well-exposed in the coastal cliffs of Camden Head and Grants Head.Carbonaceous mudstones are not common but are exposed on the Pacific Highway 5 km north of Herons Creek (location 51). Thin `coaly beds, no longer exposed, were recorded by Morrison (1922), south of Johns River Railway station (location 116). Below the mudstone-dominated top of the unit, as exposed at Camden Head and Grants Head, there is a horizon with more frequent thin- and medium-bedded sandstone beds. That horizon forms gently rounded hills throughout the outcrop area and can be seen in the cutting on the Pacific Highway 2 km south of Moorland, between Two Mile Creek and the North Coast Railway bridge (location 203). Mudstone dominates the unit between that horizon and the Coopernook Conglomerate Member. Lithology plots of measured sections of the Coopernook Conglomerate Member at other exposures - Cowarra Quarry (location 22); Rock Creek, Langley Vale (location 72 to location 74); Hannam Vale (location 87 to 88); and Sapling Creek (location 20 to location 139) - are presented in figures 6, 7, 8 and 9 respectively. Lithology plots of measured sections at the top of the sequence exposed at Camden Head (after Voisey, 1939) and at Grants Head (after Holmes & Ash 1979) are presented in figures 10 and 11, respectively.|27/SEP/11
3385|Camden Head Claystone|Depositional environment|The sedimentary sequence derived from sheet sands and channel sands incised into muddy
overbank deposits together with the laminated reddish and grey terrestrial plant-bearing silts and
clays, indicates a fluviatile depositional environment for the Camden Head Claystone. From the
identified megaflora, Holmes and Ash (1979 p. 68) concluded that `The localities from which the
bulk of our flora was collected all represent a single environment, that of back-swamps bordering
streams and filled by overbank flooding.|27/SEP/11

3385|Camden Head Claystone|Relationships and boundaries|Of Camden Haven Group (Packham 1969). Rocks of the Camden Head Claystone and, in particular, its basal Coopernook Conglomerate Member, unconformably overlie the Palaeozoic rocks of the basin floor. East of the North Coast Railway the formation overlies the Jolly Nose Conglomerate (where present) - except for a small area in the immediate vicinity of Jolly Nose Hill where the Camden Head Claystone is not present. The Camden Head Claystone is in turn overlain, generally with an erosional contact, by the Laurieton Conglomerate east of the Pacific Highway and by its lateral equivalent, the Coorabakh Conglomerate west of the Pacific Highway. The basal boundary of the Camden Head Claystone is chertquartzjasper pebble conglomerate or the reddish purple mudstone overlying the Jolly Nose Conglomerate or the Palaeozoic sedimentary rocks of the basin floor. The top of the formation is the reddish purple mudstone overlain by the cobble and pebble chertjasperquartz conglomerate of the Laurieton Conglomerate or more quartz-rich pebble conglomerate of the Coorabakh Conglomerate.Includes Coopernook Conglomerate Member. Unit overlies the Palaeozoic rocks of the Basin floor or the Jolly Nose Conglomerate. Top of unit is reddish-purple mudstone overlain by Laurieton or Coorabakh Conglomerate.|27/SEP/11
3385|Camden Head Claystone|Identifying features|The Camden Head Claystone is characterised by the presence of reddish purple mudstone.
Reddish purple mudstone is also sparsely interbedded with the sandstone and conglomerate of
its Coopernook Conglomerate Member. However, mudstone is far more strongly developed in the upper part of the formation. This upper part is predominantly (about 80%) mudstone (grey or, commonly and distinctively, reddish purple). The formation is usually highly weathered and outcrops are not common. However, its presence is indicated by the redbrown clayey soil which
develops over it. Clays of similar colour are also developed from weathering of some of the late
Triassic to Jurassic igneous rocks. Sheet sandstone is also present, having been deposited adjacent to channels incised into the underlying mudstone.|27/SEP/11
3385|Camden Head Claystone|Structure and Metamorphism|Generally the Camden Head Claystone dips slightly towards the centre of the basin. (Map 1 and Figure 2).|27/SEP/11
3385|Camden Head Claystone|Age reasons|Megaflora fossils were collected by Carne (1897), Voisey (1939) and Pratt (1970), and were
identified by W.S.Dun, A.B.Walkom and J.W. Pickett, respectively. Retallack (1977) and Holmes
and Ash (1979) also collected and identified material from the Camden Head and Grants Head
exposures. The megaflora is found in the grey mudstone while the reddish purple mudstone is
deplete of plant fossils. Four of the five locations in the Holmes and Ash (1979) study work are at the top of the Camden Head Claystone  on the southern side of Camden Head (location 66) and in a thin bed of grey siltstone exposed at the base of sea cliffs on the northern side of Perpendicular Point. The third and fourth locations were in the Camden Head Claystone at Grants Head, 8 m and 13 m (see Holmes & Ash 1979, figure 2, p. 48) below the Laurieton Conglomerate (figures 10 and 11). The fifth location was 63 m above the base of the Grants Head Formation at Bartletts Beach
(location 104). Palynological samples from the Camden Head and Grants Head exposures were studied by Helby who reported `A probable upper Early Triassic age was suggested for these assemblages on the basis of comparison with Sydney Basin assemblages (1973 p. 146).|27/SEP/11

3563|Captains Flat Formation|Unit history|Captains Flat Beds (Glasson and Paine, 1965)|
3563|Captains Flat Formation|Type section locality|Within the township of Captians Flat (Michelago 1:100 000 sheet 8726), the formation is well-exposed on Town Hill (GR 216/593). Here the sequence consists of dark grey shale, lithic and crystal tuff, dacite and basalt in a tight north-plunging syncline (Oldershaw 1965). Top and bottom are not exposed.|
3563|Captains Flat Formation|Extent|It outcrops as two meridional belts along the eastern and western margins of the Captains Flat Graben. The eastern belt, up to 2km wide, stretches from 'Woodbine' homestead (GR 333/849) on the Canberra 1:100 000 sheet, southwards to Captains Flat on the Michelago 1:100 000 sheet. The western belt of similar width follows the Lake George Range from the Bungendore-Gundaroo road south for 30km onto the Michelago sheet area.  Continuity of this belt is broken by quartz turbidite units of the Carwoola Foramtion cropping out in the Molonglo River valley.|
3563|Captains Flat Formation|Thickness range|In the vicinity of Captains Flat, Oldershaw (1965) estimated 800-1220 m while west of Hoskinstown, Wilson (1964) gave 1100m.|
3563|Captains Flat Formation|Lithology|A heterogeneous sequence of shale, siltstone, dacite, tuff and minor basalt, limestone, chert and conglomerate.|
3563|Captains Flat Formation|Depositional environment|Shallow marine.|
3563|Captains Flat Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The Captains Flat Formation in part conformably overlies the Carwoola Formation. However south of Hoskinstown the Carwoola Formation thins out to leave the Captains Flat Formation apparently conformable with the underlying Kohinoor Volcanics.  North of Hoskinstown the base of the Captains Flat Formation appears to progressively overlap the Copper Creek Shale as the Kohinoor Volcanics thin out northwards.|
3563|Captains Flat Formation|Age reasons|By stratigraphical relationships with the Kohinoor Volcanics and the Carwoola Formation, a Late Silurian age (Ludlow or younger) has been proposed by Strusz (1971) and Robinson (1979).|
3563|Captains Flat Formation|Correlations|Basaltic units in the formation tentatively suggest a correlation in part with the Currawang Basalt. The upper part may be the same age as quartz turbidite sediments of the Covan Creek Formaiton and Palerang beds. The Captains Flat formation may in part be a facies equivalent of the Carwoola Formation.|

28435|Cara Formation|Type section locality|Stratotype: The unit is not well exposed and a type area (instead of type section) is therefore nominated. The type area is along the length of Tea Tree Creek (Bingara 9038-111-N 1:25 000 topographic map sheet) from GR 703017 to GR 750502.|
28435|Cara Formation|Extent|The unit is well exposed over at least 50 km2 west of Copeton Dam between Gwydir River and Sheep Station Creek.|
28435|Cara Formation|Thickness range|Indeterminate due to faulting and poor exposure.|
28435|Cara Formation|Lithology|Cara Formation is dominated by fine-grained, siliceous, commonly tuffaceous argillites. Subordinate volcaniclastic sandstones and pebble conglomerates are also present. Tuffaceous argillites are typically thin bedded and often weather to massive, grey blue outcrops. Where not bleached tuffaceous argillite and chert range in colours from moderate red through reddish and yellowish brown to white. Tuffaceous argillite is observed in depositional contact upon altered basalt at some localities. Radiolaria are often abundant in tuffaceous argillites. Well developed axial planar cleavage indicates mesoscopic folding in some areas.|
28435|Cara Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Cara Formation is poorly exposed and intensely faulted. The base of the formation is always faulted and an unconformable contact with overlying Whitlow Formation is inferred. In places the formation has been overthrust by Woolomin Group.|
28435|Cara Formation|Age reasons|Radiolaria indicate a Famnenian-Tournaisian age.|

3716|Carwoola Formation|Name source|Richardson (1979) cites the origin of the name as Carwoola Trig. Station at GR 193/766 on the Canberra 1:100 000 sheet area.|
3716|Carwoola Formation|Unit history|Carwoola Beds (Best and others, 1964 and Oldershaw, 1965)|
3716|Carwoola Formation|Type section locality|West of Hoskinstown in the vicinity of Carwoola Trig. Station where interbeds of sandstone, siltstone and shale are folded into open north-plunging anticlines and synclines (Canberra 1:100 000 sheet 8727). The formation appears to rest conformably on the Kohinoor Volcanics, while the top is not exposed.|
3716|Carwoola Formation|Extent|Occurs over much of the central portion of the Captains Flat Graben. There are two main outcrop areas: a southern area forming hilly country west of Hoskintown and also a broad low ridge extending south along Primrose Valley; a northern area forming a low rise in the vicinity of Halfway Hill (GR 199/855) and tapering northwards as scattered outcrops towards Bungendore. The formation is also exposed along the western margin of the Captains Flat Graben between Kings Highway and Widgeewah Estate.|
3716|Carwoola Formation|Thickness range|Oldershaw (1965) gives an estimate of 1200 m west of Hoskinstown.|
3716|Carwoola Formation|Lithology|A quartz turbidite sequence of lithic and quartz sandstone with siltstone and shale. Volcanics are absent.|
3716|Carwoola Formation|Depositional environment|The Carwoola Formation is a proximal quartz turbidite sequence of local derivation which indicates marine conditions and rapid subsidence in the axis of the Captains Flat Graben.|
3716|Carwoola Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The Carwoola Formatio conformably overlies the Kohinoor Volcanics. Along Primrose Valley where the Kohinoor Volcanics are missing, the Carwoola Formation appears to rest on the Copper Creek Shale. East of Hoskinstown and along Primrose Valley the Carwoola Formation dips beneath and appears to be overlain conformably by the Captains Flat Formation. The Carwoola Formation is probably in part a lateral facies equivalent of the Captains Flat Formation since it appears to lens out southwards onto the Michelago 1:100 000 sheet area leaving the Captains Flat Formation to overlap onto the Kohinoor Volcanics.|20/MAY/08
3716|Carwoola Formation|Age reasons|Unfossiliferous. a late Silurian age (possibly Pridoli) deduced from stratigraphic relationships with the Kohinoor Volcanics and Captains Flat Formation.|
3716|Carwoola Formation|Correlations|Tentatively with quartz turbidite sediments of the Covan Creek Formation and the Palerang Beds which also overlie Late Silurian shallow marine and felsic volcanic sequences on the Braidwood and Araluen 1:100 000 sheet areas.|
24605|Chalk Mountain Formation|Name source|Chalk Mountain; GR 199148, Gilgandra Sheet 1:250 000.|
24605|Chalk Mountain Formation|Type section locality|Approximately 15-18 m of lacustrine sediments of siltstone, mudstone, clay, tuff, diatomite and lignite exposed in Quarry A on the western side of Chalk Mountain - GR as above. The top is bounded by thick flows of olivine basalt; the rarely exposed base rests on basalt, andesite and trachyte.|
24605|Chalk Mountain Formation|Extent|The unit is exposed in quarries around the upper escarpment of Chalk Mountain, 6 km south of the village of Bugaldie. The present area of the unit is approximately 38 hectares. The relationship of this unit to the diatomite deposits at Paddy McCulloch's Mountain and at Yearinan is not known.|
24605|Chalk Mountain Formation|Thickness range|Approximately 15-18 m.|
24605|Chalk Mountain Formation|Lithology|Lacustrine sediments of white to pale grey siltstone, mudstone and clay with interbedded diatomite, tuff and one lignite band near the top. Siltstone and mudstone show occasional current bedding; the diatomite exhibits (?)seasonal varves. The diatomite contains a vertebrate and invertebrate fauna and a macroflora of leaves, fruit and flowers. The diatomite and lignite contains preserved pollen and spores. Bivalves occur in a white siltstone.|
24605|Chalk Mountain Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Overlies and is overlain by igneous rocks associated with the Warrumbungle Volcano. The top of the unit is a white siltstone above a thin band of lignite. This is overlain by a thick basalt flow. The base is mudstone resting on basalt, andesite and trachyte which in turn overlie the soft sandstones of the Pilliga Sandstone.|
24605|Chalk Mountain Formation|Age reasons|The unit is interbedded between basalt flows from the Warrumbungle Volcano. Bands of tuff are included in the sediments. Therefore deposition of the unit took place during the active period of the Warrumbungle Volcano. K/Ar dating of igneous rocks around the volcanic complex range from 17 to 14 million years (Wellman and McDougall 1974) i.e. Middle Miocene. Fossil fish (Hills 1946), a bird (Rich and McEvey 1977) and diatoms (Griffin 1961; Thomas and Gould 1981 a and b) do not provide reliable evidence of age. The microflora described by Martin (in Holmes et al. 1983), differs from and appears to be younger than the Middle Miocene assemblages from the Gippsland Basin (Stover and Partridge, 1973). Because of its geographical location it is reasonable to assume that the Chalk Mountain locality was in a much lower rainfall area than south-eastern Australian coastal regions. Therefore the flora at Chalk Mountain would have shown adaptation to drier conditions earlier in the Miocene than floras in areas of higher rainfall. Hence the dissimilarities between the Chalk Mountain and Gippsland Basin microfloral assemblages reflect the differing environment and not time differences. Radiometric dating of the associated igneous rocks is being undertaken by Dr Ewart at the University of Queensland.|

28449|Cheitmore Limestone Member|Name source|Presumed to be after Cheitmore Caves, developed in the main mass of limestone.|
28449|Cheitmore Limestone Member|Unit history|The name Cheitmore Limestone was introduced by Best et al. (1964, Canberra 1:250 000 Geological Map, 2nd edition). No formal definition has been published. Our mapping on the Araluen 1:100 000 sheet has demonstrated that it is best regarded as limestone lenses developed in the De Drack Formation and of member status. A formal definition is given for the first time.|
28449|Cheitmore Limestone Member|Type section locality|On the eastern edge of the more northerly lense at GR 433462, Araluen 1:100 000 sheet.|

28449|Cheitmore Limestone Member|Thickness range|Unknown, at least 50 m.|
28449|Cheitmore Limestone Member|Lithology|Grey, strongly recrystallised massive sporite, rare patches of crinoid ossicles present. Recrystallisation caused by the Braidwood Granodiorite, which crops out close by.|
28449|Cheitmore Limestone Member|Relationships and boundaries|Both lenses are surrounded by Long Flat Volcanics, which overlies the limestone. Since the Long Flat Volcanics are known elsewhere to overly the De Drack Formation conformably, and since terrigenous sediments of the De Drack Formation crop out close by, underlying the Volcanics, it is considered that the Cheitmore Limestone is best regarded as a limestone lense at the top of the De Drack Formation. It is therefore regarded as of member status, comparable with the Wyanbene, Marble Arch and Bendethera Limestone Members.|
28449|Cheitmore Limestone Member|Age reasons|Conodonts indicate a Late Silurian age.|

24223|Cookeys Plains Formation|Name source|Parish of Cookeys Plains, County Cunningham|
24223|Cookeys Plains Formation|Type section locality|Thinly bedded quartzose sandstone, calcaraeous (usually leached) in part, with occasional limestone lenses, and grey mudstone/shale, approximately 1300 m thick, exposed in low outcrops between the Black Range (Forbes 1:250 000 GR 5665 9165) and the Byong Range (do., GR 5710 9125).|

24223|Cookeys Plains Formation|Thickness range|1100 m approximately, east of Black Range.|
24223|Cookeys Plains Formation|Lithology|The iron stained blocky sandstones are the dominant rock type, but this possibly reflects their better outcrops. These grade laterally and vertically into calcareous sandstones (usually skeletal because of leaching) and marls. The limestones are thickly bedded, and consist principally of coralline and algal debris. Near Kadungle there are thick crossbedded units of quartzose sandstone.|
24223|Cookeys Plains Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Within the Derriwong Group, overlies the Edols Conglomerate, and is overlain in turn by the Byong Volcanics. North of Trundle the contact with the Yarrabandai Formation is yet unclear. Contact with the Edols Conglomerate is believed to be conformable, but contact with the overlying Byong Volcanics is uncertain. North of Trundle, where the Byong Volcanics are absent, trends observed suggest conformity with the overlying Yarrabandai Formation.|

4789|Covan Creek Formation|Lithology|Medium-grained, thick-bedded quartz-lithic arenite and greywacke, occasionally graded or laminated; quartzite; siltstone, often cross-bedded on a small scale or laminated; shale.|
4789|Covan Creek Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The top of the Covan Creek Formation is not exposed and appears to have been removed by erosion. It is unconformably overlain by the late Early Devonian Tarago Conglomerate at one locality (GR 398163, BRAIDWOOD 1:100 000 sheet). Its relationship with underlying Late Silurian rocks is variable and appears to be conformable with the Currawang Basalt in the Currawang area (GR 25206780, Goulburn 1:250 000 geological sheet) and disconformable with the Woodlawn Volcanics and De Drack Formation elsewhere. Marked unconformity is unlikely because the Covan Creek Formation is structurally continuous with the Late Silurian rocks.|26/MAY/08
4789|Covan Creek Formation|Age reasons|On stratigraphic and structural grounds the Covan Ceek Formation appears to be of Late Silurian to early Early Devonian age. Possible plant fragments from a locality at GR 329235 (BRAIDWOOD 1:100 000 sheet) may indicate an age of earliest Devonian (Sherwin, 1973).|26/MAY/08

5030|Cunglebung Creek beds|Unit history|Previously I included these beds in the "Mann River sequence" (Fergusson, 1982).|
5030|Cunglebung Creek beds|Type section locality|Representative section: Cunglebung Creek between GR 4665 1190 and GR 5115 1322 (Mount Wellington), monotonous exposure of silicified argillite.|
5030|Cunglebung Creek beds|Extent|The unit is exposed over 200 km2 in an arcuate belt between the Mann and Nymboida rivers on the southeast portion of the Grafton 1:250 000 Sheet area (SH 56-6).|
5030|Cunglebung Creek beds|Thickness range|The monotonous lithology and lack of structural control do not enable resolution of a true stratigraphic thickness.|
5030|Cunglebung Creek beds|Lithology|Indurated massive and laminated argillite with rare chert and greywacke.|
5030|Cunglebung Creek beds|Relationships and boundaries|Unconformably overlain to the southeast by the Mesozoic Clarence-Moreton Basin. To the northwest the unit is intruded by the Dandahra Creek Granite (Brunker et al., 1976). To the northeast the unit is in probable fault contact with the Gundahl Complex and to the southwest it is abruptly juxtaposed to the Coffs Harbour beds suggestive of a faulted contact. Both the Coffs Harbour beds and Gundahl Complex are distinguished from the unit by their abundance of greywackes.|
5030|Cunglebung Creek beds|Age reasons|No fossils have been found. The unit is older than the Dandahra Creek Granite of probable Late Permian or Early Triassic age. Adjacent units are of probable Carboniferous age and this may also apply to the Cunglebung Creek beds.|

24235|Cupala Creek Formation|Name source|The formation is named after Cupala Creek, which runs southeastwards to Cootawundi Station (see Kayrunnera 1:100 000 orthophoto map 7436).|
24235|Cupala Creek Formation|Unit history|Revision of old terms: The Cupala Creek Formation was formerly equated with rocks near Mt Daubney and Old Gnalta Homestead, reported to contain plant remains (Rose, 1974).|
24235|Cupala Creek Formation|Type section locality|On a tributary of Cupala Creek from GR 6594E 5778N to GR 6589E 5769N.|
24235|Cupala Creek Formation|Extent|About 4.5 km2 in the headwaters of Cupala Creek.|
24235|Cupala Creek Formation|Thickness range|Type section 1020 m - the uppermost 190 m being unexposed. Conglomeratic unit approx. 90 m, lower red sandstone 170 m, pale-grey sandstone 235 m, upper red sandstone 125 m, olive-grey siltstone and fine sandstone 210 m, unexposed 190 m.|
24235|Cupala Creek Formation|Lithology|The unit is grossly a fining-upward succession with a basal lithic, conglomeratic unit overlain by a lower red sandstone, then a pale-grey sandstone, an upper red sandstone and a fossiliferous olive-grey siltstone with very fine sandstone interbeds. The sandstones become texturally and chemically more mature upward. Sandstones from the middle part of the formation contain angular to rounded grains, and sorting ranges from poor to good. Seven sandstone samples point-counted cluster in the feldspathic-litharenite field of Folk (1974) with quartz comprising from 45% to 57% of framework grains. Plagioclase grains are present, and rock fragments are most commonly volcanogenic, with lesser amounts of sedimentary and tectonite grains. Much of the original porosity is infilled by quartz overgrowths, and some feldspar overgrowths are present. Carbonate and ferruginous cement also occur. There appears to be no petrological difference between the framework components of the red- and grey-coloured sandstone beds - the colour difference being caused by a ferruginous cement or coating on the grains in the red sandstone.|
24235|Cupala Creek Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Overlies the Copper Mine Range Beds (Pogson and Scheibner, 1971) with marked angular unconformity, and is in turn overlain with moderate-angle unconformity by the quartzose sandstone and silt of the Mulga Downs Group.|
24235|Cupala Creek Formation|Age reasons|Trilobites and brachiopods from the olive-grey fine sandstone and siltstone are Idamean (Late Cambrian). No fossils have been found in the underlying Copper Mine Range Beds, and Skolithos worm tubes are the only known fossils from the overlying Mulga Downs Group in this area, although elsewhere (near Cobar) basal Mulga Downs Group contains late Early to early Middle Devonian fish plates (Ritchie, 1973). The Kandie Tank Limestone, reported to contain Upper Cambrian to Tremadocian fossils (Warris, 1967, in Pogson and Scheibner, 1971), is probably considerably younger than the exposed Cupala Creek Formation. |

24238|Curmulee Conglomerate|Name source|After Curmulee Creek, which drains the eastern side of the Minuma Range and joins the Deua River at GR 472297 Araluen 1:100 000 sheet.|
24238|Curmulee Conglomerate|Unit history|The name Curmulee Conglomerate has not previously been used. Johnson (1964, unpublished M.Sc. Thesis, ANU) used the name "Grieg Creek Conglomerate" for this unit, however the name has previously been used in NSW and hence is unavailable for publication, the name Curmulee Conglomerate being introduced as a replacement.|
24238|Curmulee Conglomerate|Type section locality|In a small, steep gully on eastern side of Minuma Range at GR 424258; all of the unit, here about 20 m thick, is exposed.|
24238|Curmulee Conglomerate|Extent|Mainly on the western slopes of the Minuma Range.|
24238|Curmulee Conglomerate|Thickness range|A maximum of 20 m at the type locality. About 10 m at its northernmost outcrop, where faulted out, at GR 398377. Thins southwards and is absent south of GR 412233.|
24238|Curmulee Conglomerate|Lithology|Typically massive, reddish-brown, well rounded conglomerate with clasts normally <5 cm across. Minor pebbly arenite, coarse arenite and siltstone.|
24238|Curmulee Conglomerate|Relationships and boundaries|Overlies conformably but abruptly the Long Swamp Creek Formation and is overlain conformably by Deua Formation, the contact being gradational over 2 to 5 m. The upper contact is taken at the top of the highest conglomerate or pebbly arenite bed.|
24238|Curmulee Conglomerate|Age reasons|The unit is unfossiliferous. A Late Devonian age is suggested by its relationship with overlying Deua Formation.|
38099|Currangandi Group|Name source|From Currangandi, elevation 882 m, (0243300E 6668370N, Eulowrie 8937-1-N, 1:25,000 sheet) a mountain mid-way between Rocky Creek and Boomi Creek, 12 km northwest of Upper Horton.|
38099|Currangandi Group|Constituents|Rocky Creek region: Spion Kop Conglomerate, Ermelo Pyroclastics, Clifden Formation, Rocky Creek Conglomerate and Lark Hill Formation. Carroll-Nandewar block and tentatively the Clifton-Carroll block: Willuri Formation. Werrie Syncline: Currabubula Formation.|
38099|Currangandi Group|Extent|Extends from the northern closure of the Rocky Creek Syncline east of Terry Hie Hie to the Waverley Fault north of Gundy. Main outcrops in the north are in the Rocky Creek Syncline, Kathrose and Darthula blocks; south of the Nandewar Range throughout the remainder of the Rocky Creek Syncline, Carroll-Nandewar and possibly Clifton-Carroll blocks; in the Werrie Syncline from the northern closure of the Currabubula Formation southwards to the Waverley Fault via the eastern limb of the syncline, Quirindi and Castle Mountain Domes and Kankool Anticline.|
38099|Currangandi Group|Lithology|Continental, volcanogenic sandstone, conglomerate and siltstone with interbedded  ignimbrites, rare lavas and in some cases glacigene features including varved shales, dropped pebbles and tillite. The Spion Kop Conglomerate, which contains evidence of a glacial origin (White 1968), lacks interbedded ignimbrites and contains a greater proportion of metamorphic and igneous clasts than conglomerates in other constituent formations. The Ermelo Pyroclastics contain rare resedimented pebbles.|
38099|Currangandi Group|Age reasons|Largely Namurian to Westphalian. A single rhyolite flow from the upper part of the Willuri Formation on Tulcumba Ridge has a SHRIMP AS3 age of between 297 and 287 Ma (?latest Carboniferous to Early Permian). The next youngest dated ignimbrite is 307.8+/-3.7 Ma old (Westphalian). The rhyolite appears to be in sequence with the Willuri Formation but, because of a possible hiatus between this and underlying units, could belong to the Early Permian Boggabri Volcanics. Resolution of conflicting SHRIMP SL13 and AS3 ages for the Kiaman Reversal (Opdyke et al. 2000; Roberts et al. in press; Figure 6) is required to clarify the age of the Clifden Formation, the oldest unit of the group containing ignimbrites. The age of the underlying Spion Kop Conglomerate is not determinable, but its glacigene origin (White 1968) may suggest a Namurian age.|

5150|Dalmally Basalt Member|Name source|After Dalmally Homestead, near where Copes Creek flows into the Nymboida River.|
5150|Dalmally Basalt Member|Type section locality|The basalt is about 15 m thick outside the meander bend on the true right bank of Copes Creek ("Nymboida" 1:63,360 military map, GR 808877).|
5150|Dalmally Basalt Member|Description at type locality|McElroy (1963, pp.49, 59) has described the outcrop, petrography and chemistry of this unit. The CIPW norm calculated from McElroy's analysis indicates a sub-alkaline (non-alkaline) basaltic composition. Several specimens illustrating the textural variation in this rock have been placed in the collections of the Geology Department, University of New England (UNER 34382, 35367-35370).|
5150|Dalmally Basalt Member|Relationships and boundaries|Bardool Conglomerate of the Nymboida Coal Measures, underlying the far southwestern Moreton Basin (McElroy, 1963).|
5150|Dalmally Basalt Member|Age reasons|Why the Dalmally Basalt Member is a Triassic Flow: The elongate outcrop of the basalt is concordant with the strike of the surrounding Triassic sedimentary rocks and completely within the outcrop of the Bardool Conglomerate. The dip of the bench-forming top of the basalt is also the same as the dip of overlying conglomerate, sandstone and tuff. Concordance is also supported by the outcrop pattern of vertical texture variation in the basalt at the type locality. The basalt has a glassy, block-jointed base, and a more massive central portion containing feldspar phenocrysts. Amygdales and vesicles increase in abundance and size towards the top of the flow. The vesicles are up to 3 cm in diameter and may be partly or completely filled with calcite, zeolites and quartz. Some rounded basalt floaters found on the hillside above the top of the basalt are very strongly vesicular and resemble basaltic scoria. In the creek bank exposure at "Nymboida" grid. ref. 808873, coarsely vesicular basalt with lenticular flow structure appears to cut a shallow channel into the underlying well-jointed basalt. The Cope's Creek Tuff, only 15 to 30 m above Dalmally Basalt Member, is evidence of associated Triassic pyroclastic activity in this area. The Dalmally Basalt Member is chemically more similar to some Triassic basalts in south-eastern Queensland than to subalkaline Tertiary basalts in northeastern New South Wales (McElroy, 1963, p.63; Wilkinson, pers. comm).   Geological age: Homotaxial megafossil floras found both stratigraphically above and below the Dalmally Basalt Member indicate that it is Late Anisian to Ladinian in age.  Isotopic age:  Unweathered plagioclase from near the base of the basalt yielded a 40K/40Ar isotopic age of 211 +/- 5 million years.  Isotopic Age: Unweathered plagiaoclase from near the base of the basalt yielded a 40K/40Ar isotopic age of 211 +/- 5 million years.|

The Dangarfield Formation is overlain by the Isismurra Formation (Manser, 1968, Wingen 1:100 000 sheet, University of New England Map Series). In the type section, the boundary is taken at the transition from brown lithic sandstones to pink cross-bedded lithic sandstones; the pink sandstone is lithologically typical of the Isismurra Formation, and is succeeded by the Ayr Conglomerate Member. Elsewhere, the Dangarfield Formation is overlain by Ayr Conglomerate.|

24240|Danswell Creek Granodiorite|Type section locality|The granodiorite is well represented at GR 118334.|
24240|Danswell Creek Granodiorite|Description at type locality|Coarse-grained hypidiomorphic granular texture, becoming finer grained to porphyritic along the margins. It typically consists of bluish quartz crystals, pink K-feldspar, plagioclase, and clusters of medium-grained biotite and hornblende. Xenoliths of ?sedimentary origin are most common towards the margin of the granodiorite.|
24240|Danswell Creek Granodiorite|Extent|The granodiorite constitutes the northern part of the Sapling Flat Igneous Complex and lies to the northwest of Jerangle.  Size: 8 km2.|
24240|Danswell Creek Granodiorite|Relationships and boundaries|The Danswell Creek Granodiorite is the minor phase of the Sapling Flat Igneous Complex; it intrudes Late Ordovician metasediments (Foxlow Beds) and is bounded on its eastern side by the Narongo Fault and the Kohinoor Volcanics of Late Silurian age. Contact metamorphism leading to the development of andalusite has taken place adjacent to the granodiorite.|
24240|Danswell Creek Granodiorite|Age reasons|K-Ar age dating by AMDEL give an age of 356 +/- 7 m.y. (Biotite) and 353 +/- 7 m.y. (Hornblende). However, as the specimens were collected in proximity to the Narongo Fault it is more likely that the granodiorite has a greater age I.e. intruded at the close of the Silurian Period-beginning of Devonian Period.|

5292|De Drack Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The De Drack Formation unconformably overlies the Birkenburn Beds and undifferentiated Ordovician metasediments. It interfingers with and is overlain by the Woodlawn Volcanics. It is overlain, probably disconformably, by the Covan Creek Formation and unconformably overlain by the Tarago Conglomerate. It is faulted against the Birkenburn Beds and probably also against undifferentiated Ordovician metasediments. Its relationship with the Long Flat Volcanics is obscure. It is intruded by the Boro Granite. The base of the De Drack Formation is marked in places by a chert-rich conglomerate-arenite unit whose thickness does not exceed 5 m. Elsewhere the base of the unit is faulted against Ordovician rocks.|

25874|Deakin Volcanics|Name source|Named from the Canberra suburb of Deakin (Opik 1958).|
25874|Deakin Volcanics|Unit history|None.|
25874|Deakin Volcanics|Constituents|Mugga Mugga Porphyry Member.|
25874|Deakin Volcanics|Type section locality|Cutting along the Tuggeranong Parkway between Hindmarsh Drive and the Cotter Road overpass (Lat 35o 20'S Long 140o 03'E). Roadcuts expose the basal position of the Deakin Volcanics as a weathered southwest-dipping sequence of interbedded rhyodacitic ignimbrite, sandstone, siltstone and shale.  Southwards the section passes up into a massive and locally banded rhyodacitic ignimbrite. The top and bottom of the formation are not exposed. Minimum thickness exposed is estimated as 400m.|
25874|Deakin Volcanics|Extent|Good outcrop development south of the Deakin Fault in the Weston Creek, Tuggeranong and Lanyon areas.  Poorly exposed in the Belconnen area but northwards better exposures are found west of Gooroomon Ponds Creek.  Formation wedges out south of Tharwa by fault contact with the Colinton volcanics.|
25874|Deakin Volcanics|Thickness range|In the Weston Creek area Henderson (1981) estimated 1000 m, but may reach 1500 m in the Tuggeranong area.|
25874|Deakin Volcanics|Lithology|Rhyodacitic ignimbrite, lava (Mugga Mugga Porphyry Member), tuff, tuffaceous shale and minor quartz sandstones and volcanic breccia - units show reddish brown alteration.|
25874|Deakin Volcanics|Depositional environment|Shallow marine conditions initially with eventual establishment of subaerial environment.|
25874|Deakin Volcanics|Relationships and boundaries|At the base the Deakin Volcanics appear to overlie the Yarralumla Formation conformably but overlap disonformably on to the Mount Painter Volcanics. At the top the Deakin Volcanics pass conformably up into the Laidlaw Volcanics but contacts are not exposed; the units units are distinguished by petrology and geochemistry.|
25874|Deakin Volcanics|Age reasons|Constrained by the early Ludlovian age of the underlying Yarralumla Formation (Strusz 1984), the Yass Formation (Link and Druce, 1972) and also the overlying Laidlaw Volcanics (Wyborn and others 1982).|
25874|Deakin Volcanics|Correlations|The formation has petrological and chemical similarities with the Colinton Volcanics and may be co-eval with the basal units of the Laidlaw Volcanics (Wyborn and others 1982).|

5426|Deua Formation|Lithology|Typically reddish-purple to reddish brown, medium to fine grained lithic quartzo-feldspathic arenite with minor shale. Arenite is generally well-bedded, in units 10 to 50 cm thick, and often contains shale "rip-up" clasts. Cross-bedding is common.|
5426|Deua Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Rests conformably on the Curmulee Conglomerate, or where the Conglomerate is absent, on the Long Swamp Creek Formation; in both cases the contact is gradational over several metres. The Deua Formation is overlain conformably by the Khan Yunis Formation, again with a gradational contact. The top of the Deua Formation is placed at the base of the first coarse arenite or pebbly arenite in the sequence.|

24931|Drysdale Conglomerate Member|Unit history|Andrews (1913) referred to the conglomerates as the Drysdale Conglomerates (page vi) and Mount Drysdale Conglomerates (page 42). Longman and Meares (1972) included these beds in their Mt Drysdale Conglomerate.|
24931|Drysdale Conglomerate Member|Type section locality|No type section of this member has been measured due to the deformation in the member. A good section through part of the member crops out on NW/SE trending spurs near Mount Drysdale trigonometrical station. The base of the member is near the foot of the spurs on the western side of the Mount Drysdale range but the boundary itself is not exposed. The top of the member can be observed in outcrops just east of Cougar trig. station.|
24931|Drysdale Conglomerate Member|Extent|The Member is exposed in a series of isolated outcrops on ridges between Cougar (GR 385131) and Mooka (GR 383160) Trigonometrical Stations in the northwest part of the Cobar 1:250 000 sheet.|

24256|Dungay Group|Identifying features|The group consists of the Kullatine Formation, Majors Creek Formation and Boonanghi beds. The name is taken from Dungay Creek which drains a large portion of the northern part of the Parrabel Anticline. It is a tributary of the Mackay River at 31o07'S, 152o35'E, west of Kempsey. There are excellent exposures in the creek and in cuttings on the road beside the creek. The base of the Boonanghi beds is not exposed. According to Northcott (1973), in an unpublished thesis (in the University of New England library), the top of Kullatine Formation is an erosion surface which he called the Sebastopol Disconformity. That name has been used by Korsch and Harrington (1981) in their Figure 5 (Column 7) and their page 215 (Column 1). The Yessabah Limestone is above the disconformity and is of Early Permian age. The Dungay Group is thought to be entirely Late Carboniferous, but the Boonanghi beds might be older. The Majors Creek and Kullatine formations both contain Levipustula levis which is Late Carboniferous. The group makes up most of the sequence in the Parrabel Anticline as shown on the 1:500 000 and 1:250 000 geological maps published by the NSW Geological Survey.|

24258|Dunhill Bluff Limestone Member|Identifying features|The Dunhill Bluff Limestone Member was known previously as the 'mixed fauna' unit (Webby 1969). In the type section on Dunhill Bluff (GR 753814*) the member is 24.5 m thick. Above the gradational contact with the underlying Taplow Limestone Member, the sequence is thin-bedded, and comprises some 6 m of grey skeletal wackestones with thin shale partings. A small fault in the type section disrupts the top of this sequence but is unlikely to be responsible for loss of more than 1 m of beds.  The 12 m thick succession above the fault exhibits marked colour change from grey to orange-brown, and increase in calcareous siltstone content. The beds are thin bedded alternting skeletal packstones, wackestones and calcareous siltstones with a varied shelly fauna. The succeeding 4 m of sequence contains a small bioherm and a varied coral and stromatoporoid fauna. The remaining, uppermost 4.5 m of the Dunhill Bluff Limestone Member comprises alternating thin bedded 'platy' skeletal wackestones with shally partings and thicker trilobite-rich packstones. The thinner bedded skeletal wackestones at the top are in relatively sharp contact with overlying, massive bedded lime mudstones and fine grainstones of basal Transmission Limestone Member. Like the other subdivisions of the Fossill Hill Limestone, the Dunhill Bluff Limestone Member has been mapped as a continuous thin-bedded unit with rich and varied faunal and floral associations.

24260|Ednas Gneiss|Name source|Taken from Ednas Tank (GR 6000 4040 Redan 1:25 000 sheet).|
24260|Ednas Gneiss|Unit history|Incorporated in undifferentiated Thackaringa Group by Willis et al. (1983). Part of "Redan gneiss" of Rayner (1949) and part of "Redan rock unit association" of Corbett (1981).|
24260|Ednas Gneiss|Type section locality|No continuous section is available, but an incomplete type section is nominated between GR 550362 (near base) and GR 568405 (top) (Redan 1:25 000 sheet). Reference sections are nominated between GR 635358 and GR 660362 (Redan 1:25 000 sheet) and between GR 731435 and GR 725443 (Kinalung 1:25 000 sheet).|
24260|Ednas Gneiss|Description at type locality|Ednas Gneiss consists mostly of albite rich rock types. The most distinctive type is an albite-quartz-magnetite rock or gneiss. This rock exhibits layering on a scale of several cm to several 10's of cm. The layering is mainly defined by concentrations of magnetite and was interpreted by Corbett (1981) as bedding. This mineralogical layering imparts a gneissic appearance to the rock, hence the term "Gneiss". The rock consists of albite and quartz in various proportions, plus 5-10% magnetite. In outcrop the rock is typically stained reddish by secondary iron oxides. Ednas Gneiss also contains substantial amounts of more leucocratic albite-quartz (+/- magnetite) rocks, gradational in character to the gneissic rock described above. Also present are small amounts of albite-quartz-amphibole-magnetite rock, identical with that which characterises Redan Gneiss. Minor metasedimentary composite gneiss and very minor amphibolite are present. Quartz-magnetite rocks are known only north of Menindee Tank (GR 739420 Kinalung 1:25 000 sheet).|
24260|Ednas Gneiss|Extent|The formation crops out very poorly, but is inferred to extend across the central part of the Redan 1:25 000 sheet, from west to east, and onto the lower part of the Kinalung 1:25 000 sheet. This formation wraps around the Redan Gneiss in the Redan Antiform.|
24260|Ednas Gneiss|Thickness range|Outcrop width ranges from about 2 to 2.5 km on the northern side of the Redan Antiform, where magnetic trends imply no major structural reversals. Allowing for non-vertical dip and small scale internal folding, true width might be about 1 km.|
24260|Ednas Gneiss|Relationships and boundaries|The base is defined by a change from a predominance of amphibole-bearing albite rich rocks (Redan Gneiss) to a predominance of magnetite bearing albite rich rocks (Ednas Gneiss). The basal part of Ednas Gneiss corresponds with a linear magnetic high, on the northern limb of the Redan Antiform. The top of Ednas Gneiss is defined by an increase in the abundance of metasediments or metasedimentary composite gneiss and/or a decrease in the  abundance of albite-quartz-magnetite gneiss. The upper part of Ednas Gneiss corresponds with a particularly strong linear magnetic high.|
24260|Ednas Gneiss|Age reasons|Part of Proterozoic Willyama Supergroup - similarity of rock types, no observed unconformtiy.|

6504|Fairy Meadow Limestone Member|Unit history|The limestones at Mount Fairy were referred to collectively by Carne and Jones (1919) as the "Fairy Meadow limestones". These limestones are now subdivided on lithological grounds, the name Sandhills Creek Limestone Member (Felton and Huleatt, 1975) being applied to the principal limestone/dolomite outcrops along Sandhills Creek and Fairy  Meadow Creek. The term Fairy Meadow Limestone Member is here applied to the smaller unit described above.|
6504|Fairy Meadow Limestone Member|Type section locality|In Fairy Meadow Creek as above. 10 m of limestone is exposed.|
6504|Fairy Meadow Limestone Member|Extent|The main outcrop of the unit is in Fairy Meadow Creek at GR 367044, Braidwood 1:100 000 sheet. Two small outcrops 500 m to the east may also belong to the unit.|
6504|Fairy Meadow Limestone Member|Thickness range|10 m at the type section.|
6504|Fairy Meadow Limestone Member|Lithology|Finely laminated micrite.|
6504|Fairy Meadow Limestone Member|Relationships and boundaries|The unit appears to be a lens or discontinuous horizon of limestone enclosed by siltstone and tuffaceous arenite. Boundaries of the units, where exposed, are sharp.|
6504|Fairy Meadow Limestone Member|Age reasons|The age of the De Drack Formation is Late Silurian, based on the identification of Monograptus(?)bohemicus by Strusz and Nicoll (1973). The Fairy Meadow Limestone is therefore also Late Silurian. The limestone itself is unfossiliferous.|

6862|Fossil Hill Limestone|Identifying features|DEFINTION: The informal 'Lower Member' of Webby (1969) was named the Fossil Hill Limestone Member by Osborne (1978); this latter is now redefined as a formation. It is probably equivalent to both 'Davy's Creek limestone' and 'Large Flat limestone' of Opik (MS) as quoted by Stevens (in Hill, 1957, p.100). Use of 'Davy's Creek limestone', however, must be abandoned as it duplicates the earlier established Davies Creek Granite (Stanton, 1956). The Fossil Hill Limestone is the lower of the three constituent formations of the Cliefden Caves Limestone  Group. The name derives from Fossil Hill where the lower part of the formation is exceptionally well exposed. The type section was not designated by Osborne (1978). It will be designated in forthcoming publication as composite including section through lower part on Fossil Hill (GR 752812*) and section of upper part on immediately adjacent Dunhill Bluff (GR 753814*). This is consistent with Osborne's original description. In the type area, the Fossil Hill Limestone is 110 m thick. The change in rank is necessitated by the recent geological mapping of the limestone by Webby and Packham and the recognition of six mappable subdivisions (members) of the Fossil Hill Limestone.

26305|Gearys Gap Formation|Type section locality|A fully cored type section is unavailable because drillcore recovery in this formation is generally poor.  A representative section is designated from BMR drillhole C354, over the intervals 116.5-132.0m; 135.5-149.5m; and 160.0-164.5m. Deeply weathered sand and gravel with minor clay and silt have been cored at recovery levels mostly in excess of 90%.|13/NOV/13
26305|Gearys Gap Formation|Extent|Lake George drainage base (Canberra 1:100 000 sheet 8727). The unit is represented by patches of ferruginous quartz gravel on the escarpment near Gearys Gap (GR 159/122) and silcrete on the western shore of Lake George (GR 170/113). Subsurface distribution is in palaeodrainage lines beneath Lake George.|
26305|Gearys Gap Formation|Thickness range|A maximum thickness of 58m has been recorded in BMR drillhole C354 (Abell 1985a).|
26305|Gearys Gap Formation|Lithology|Deeply weathered sand and gravel with minor silt and clay interbeds.  Lithological contrasts within the unit are apparent on downhole gamma and neutron logs (Abell 1985a).  The unit is characterised by illite, illitic mixed clays and residual kaolinite (Abell 1985b).|
26305|Gearys Gap Formation|Depositional environment|Fluvial.|
26305|Gearys Gap Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Base unconformable on an irregular bedrock surface of Late Ordovician and Late Silurian rocks. The unit passes upwards into finer sand and clay of the overlying Ondyong Point Formation. The top is also arbitarily taken at the top of a deeply weathered profile suggesting a disconformable relationship with the Ondyong Point Formation.|
26305|Gearys Gap Formation|Age reasons|Unfossiliferous. An Early Miocene or older age is likely because of the probable Late Miocene age of the overlying Ondyong Point Formation and the Mid to Late Tertiary age placed on the the deep weathering profile (Ruxton and Taylor, 1982).|
26305|Gearys Gap Formation|Correlations|Beyond the limits of the Lake George Basin the formation correlates with unnamed indurated quartz gravels along the eastern and southern margins of the Carwoola Flats (near Hoskinstown) and in the Yass River basin. In the Goulburn-Crookwell area the formation may be co-eval with quartzose sediments in the Hollymount Formation (Bishop 1984).|

35899|Gibsonvale Formation|Name source|The unit is named after the hamlet of Gibsonvale, which is in turn named after Jack Gibson, a prospector who discovered alluvial tin deposits in the area in 1938.|
35899|Gibsonvale Formation|Geomorphic expression|Large areas of the unit have been redistributed and artificially sorted by mining operations and the unit is now best exposed in pits.|
35899|Gibsonvale Formation|Type section locality|In situ deposits occur in a scraping (469483 MGAE, 6275868 MGAN) 400 m east south east of Kikoira, where they unconformably overlie Ordovician metasedimentary rock. A weathering profile is developed in coarse sandstone in the northern bank of Contessa's Open Cut Mine (470833 MGAE, 6276363 MGAN).|
35899|Gibsonvale Formation|Extent|Exposed mainly in pits and open cut mines which are scattered over approximately 10km southeast from Kikoira to Gibsonvale, it continues as deep leads which have been partially mapped by mining companies extending towards the east.|
35899|Gibsonvale Formation|Thickness range|Company drilling suggests that the basal gravel deposits are typically up to 3 m thick and overlain by 6 m of unconsolidated, well-sorted fine- to medium-grained quartz sand passing up into 15 m of clayey sand and brown clay. A mottled ferruginous weathering profile is sometimes observable and is overlain by up to 3 m of red soil.|
35899|Gibsonvale Formation|Lithology|The unit consists of quartzose conglomerate, pebbly sandstone and sandstone which contain common detrital cassiterite. Clasts are sub-rounded to rounded and consist of dominant white vein quartz  with minor cassiterite and metasedimentary lithics. Typically, the coarse-grained sandy matrix consists of angular to sun-angular grains of quartz, cassiterite (some quartz veined), altered feldspar, tourmaline and chert with interstitial kaolinite and sporadically developed limonitic cement.|
35899|Gibsonvale Formation|Depositional environment|The gravels were deposited by high energy braided streams which dissected the weathered landscape and followed a course defined by the (partly faulted) boundary between the Kikoira Granite and Ordovician metasedimentary rocks, and joints and fractures within these terrains.|

35899|Gibsonvale Formation|Diastems or hiatuses|Sporadically developed weathering profiles at the top of the Gibsonvale Formation reflect depositional hiatuses.|
35899|Gibsonvale Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The unit unconformably overlies a range of Palaeozoic rocks and is overlain by mixed alluvial and aeolian Quaternary deposits.|
35899|Gibsonvale Formation|Age reasons|Tertiary (-?Quaternary). Though not directly dated, comparison with coarse alluvial deposits dated by palynology elsewhere in NSW (eg H Martin for DLWC), suggests likely to be Neogene (Miocene?) in age.|

24286|Gleesons Limestone Member|Identifying features|Definition: The Gleesons Limestone Member was previously known informally as the 'lower big shell' unit (Webby 1969). The name is derived from Gleesons Creek (GR 759829*) a tributary of the Belubula River, some 2 km north-north-east of Fossil Hill. It represents the lowest of the six constituent members of the Fossil Hill Limestone. Despite being affected by a number of small folds and faults in the type section on the north-east slopes of Fossil Hill (GR. 752812*), the order of succession and thickness of the Gleesons Limestone Member can be firmly established. It rests with apparent disconformity on the Walli Andesite and is succeeded by the Kalimna Limestone Member (new name) of the Fossil Hill Limestone. In the type section it is 20 m thick, and comprises 6 m of volcanic breccia, calcareous siltstones and shales (a 'lithic' unit); 4.5 m of a lime-mud and wackestone-supported Eodinobolus shell bank; 2 m of gastropod, algal (Hedstroemia) and coral (Tetradium)-dominated wackestones; 4.5 m of skeletal wackestones with bryozoans at two horizons; 1.5 m of platy bedded, pelloidal packstones; and 1.5 m of Eodinobolus-dominated wackestones. The Gleesons Limestone Member has been mapped as an independent unit throughout the Cliefden Caves area.  (*Canowindra 1:50 000 sheet 8630 I & IV, edit 1 (1978)).|

24296|Goonbri Formation|Lithology|A coarsening upward sequence. Basal section is a dark, massive siltstone. Central part is interbedded fine grained sandstone and siltstone with evidence of bioturbation. Top is characterised by a massive, fine to medium grained sandstone.|
24296|Goonbri Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Suggest unconformably overlies the Boggabri Volcanics (Hanlon, 1949) and the Leard Formation (Brownlow, 1981), if present. Goonbri Formation onlaps the Boggabri Volcanics. The Leard Formation is a weathering product of the Boggabri Volcanics so it is likely that the Goonbri also onlaps the Beard Formation in a similar manner. Conformably overlain by the Maules Creek Formation (Brownlow, 1981). First appearance of coal marks top of the Goonbri Formation.|
24296|Goonbri Formation|Age reasons|Microflora is fairly restricted but can be assigned to Early Permian Stage 3 of Price, 1976 (McMinn, 1981) viz interval between first occurrence of g. trisinus and thymospora cicatricosus. Abundance of monosaccate pollen (I.e. plicatipollenites spp.) also indicates Early Permian age.|

24297|Goonigal Group|Name source|Goonigal Creek between GR 1575 9110 and GR 16709020 (Bathurst 1:250 000).|
24297|Goonigal Group|Unit history|The Goonigal Group is equivalent to the invalid "Fairhill Formation" of Savage (1968). The equivalent strata further to the north was subdivided by Maggs (1963) and the original formation of Savage was elevated to group status by work presented in the NSW Geological Survey's Silurian Lexicon.|
24297|Goonigal Group|Type section locality|The group as a whole has no specific type section, and the component formations and lithologies are described elsewhere.|
24297|Goonigal Group|Extent|The unit is exposed in several north-south trendings tracts - two undifferentiated tracts, one up to 6 km wide extending from about 13 km S to 6 km N of Manildra, and the other extending from about 11 km SSE to 18 km NNE of Manildra and about 2 km wide (both on Bathurst 1:250 000 sheet); and two differentiated tracts, the first composed of the Wansey Tuff, Geneffe Shale, Burgoon Formation and Jews Creek Volcanics and extending from 16 km N of Manildra (Bathurst 1:250 000 sheet) to 22 km SSE of Yeoval (Dubbo 1:250 000 sheet); and the second consisting of the Myrangle Formation and the Buckinbah Volcanics, extending from about 22 km SSE of Yeoval to 14 km SE of Yeoval. The latter two tracts are up to about 3 km wide.|
24297|Goonigal Group|Thickness range|The group is about 1100 m thick in the south, and increases to about 1250 m in the north. Details of thicknesses of individual formations are given elsewhere.|
24297|Goonigal Group|Lithology|Predominantly andesitic to dacitic volcanic sandstones, greywackes, siltstones and shales with lesser amounts of non-tuffaceous sediments and intermediate to acid lavas.|
24297|Goonigal Group|Relationships and boundaries|A brachiopod fauna in the uppermost horizons of the group indicate a Pridolian or early Gedinnian age (Savage, 1973), and underlying formations limit the lower parts of the group to the late Silurian. The group underlies the Early Devonian Gregra Group (Savage, 1968) with conformity, and conformably overlies the Mackeys Creek shale (Savage, 1968).|

24299|Gourock Granodiorite|Extent|Near the axis of the Gourock Range in the Crow Valley Creek valley on the western side and the Jerrabattgulla Creek valley on the eastern side. The granodiorite is composed of two separate elongate masses each of about 7 km2.|
24299|Gourock Granodiorite|Lithology|Everywhere the granodiorite is strongly foliated. It is mainly medium grained hornblende granodiorite but in the southern parts of the two separate masses medium grained leucogranite predominates. At the head of Crow Valley Creek the leucogranite forms meridional trending dyke-like bodies.|
24299|Gourock Granodiorite|Age reasons|The granodiorite is probably Early Devonian and has been deformed in the Carboniferous. A sample from GR 261410 yielded a biotite K/Ar age of 373 +/- 6 m.y. and a biotite-whole rock Rb/Sr age of 380 +/- 6 m.y. with initial ratio 0.7103.

The Grants Head Formation was described and formally named by Pratt and Herbert (1973), after Grants Head where, on the northern side, the formation is best exposed in the coastal cliffs and adjacent rock platform.|28/SEP/11
7702|Grants Head Formation|Unit history|Named by Pratt & Herbert (1973). [RefID 32719]|07/SEP/10
7702|Grants Head Formation|Geomorphic expression|The Grants Head Formation forms low coastal cliffs and crops out poorly in the gently undulating
lowlands in a shallow syncline in the immediate vicinity of Bonny Hills.|28/SEP/11
7702|Grants Head Formation|Type section locality|Grants Head, from Lat 31.59803deg S, Long 152.84719deg E to Lat 31.58994deg S, Long 152.84004deg E. The type section is exposed in cliffs and along the rock platform from the northern side of Grants Head to the southern end of Rainbow Beach at Bonny Hills. Pratt and Herbert (1973) nominated the exposure at Grants Head as the type section. A precise location at Grants Head, between GR 485504 6504108 (1:25 000 map sheet 9434-1-N, Grants Head; location 31; Photograph 5), and GR 484824 6505004 (1:25 000 map sheet 9434-1-N, Grants Head; location 33) is now specified as the location of the type section.

7702|Grants Head Formation|Description at type locality|The formation is an overall upward-fining sequence grading from minor pebble and granule
conglomerate interbedded with lithicquartz sandstone and siltstone near the base, passing
upwards into interbedded quartzlithic and quartz sandstone and grey mudstone. The unit contains a wide variety of bedding thicknesses and sedimentary structures. Bedding thicknesses range from thick beds of granule conglomerate and sandstone to very thinly laminated beds of mudstone. Sedimentary structures include cross stratification, parallel laminations, flaser bedding, ripple laminations, occasional palaeosols, and upward-fining sequences.|28/SEP/11
7702|Grants Head Formation|Extent|The formation is only exposed on the northeastern edge of the Lorne Basin. The author has not
identified the formation west of the Jolly Nose Hill.|28/SEP/11
7702|Grants Head Formation|Extent|Lorne Basin.|07/SEP/10
7702|Grants Head Formation|Thickness range|The Grants Head Formation at the type section is 155 m in thickness. However, the top of the
section is faulted out so the true thickness may exceed that figure.|28/SEP/11
7702|Grants Head Formation|Thickness range|a) at type section: 75 m.  B) maximum known: 75 m.|07/SEP/10
7702|Grants Head Formation|Lithology|Interbedded sandstone and laminated fine sandstone and shale.|07/SEP/10
7702|Grants Head Formation|Lithology|Analysis of the type section (Figure 13), indicated lithological composition of: conglomerate 1%;
sandstone 40%; and siltstone and claystone 59%. The formation fines upwards with rudaceous
rocks dominating the basal 45 m (conglomerate 3%; sandstone 66%; and siltstone and claystone
31%). Siltstone and claystone dominate the upper 110 m, with sandstone (30%) and siltstone and
claystone (70%).|
7702|Grants Head Formation|Depositional environment|A fluviatile depositional environment for the Grants Head Formation is indicated by the presence of cross-stratified sheet and channel sandstone deposits, levee deposits, ripple lamination, flasar
bedding, laminated grey siltstones with root casts and occasional palaeosol horizons. Megafossil
floral material was collected and examined by Holmes and Ash (1979) from the Grants Head
Formation and they also suggested a depositional environment of backswamps bordering streams
and filled by overbank flooding for the plant-bearing strata.|28/SEP/11

7702|Grants Head Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The Grants Head Formation conformably overlies the top pebble conglomerate bed of Laurieton
Conglomerate (Figure 13) at its type section. However, the top of the section is faulted so that its
overlying stratigraphic relationships are unknown. Along most of the type section, the Grants Head Formation is unconformably overlain by beds up to 3 m thick of ferricrete-containing clasts of Grants Head Formation, grading in size from granule to boulders, set in a ferruginised matrix of mud to pebble conglomerate and well exposed at Boat Ramp Beach (location 32). These ferruginised beds are probably of Quaternary age.|28/SEP/11
7702|Grants Head Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Conformably overlies the Laurieton Conglomerate.|07/SEP/10
7702|Grants Head Formation|Identifying features|The distinguishing features for the Grants Head Formation are the absence of reddish purple
interbedded mudstone and the absence of cobbles in the conglomerates of the lower, coarser
part of the formation. Near the top of the cliff at the northern end of Bartletts Beach at Bonny Hills (location 104) a reddish purple hue is imparted to grey mudstones by a veneer of flakey ferruginised float from ferruginised horizons above. Close examination revealed the horizon to contain plant remains. Also absent from the Grants Head Formation are the tuff beds and poor coaly horizons characteristic of the younger Milligans Road Formation.|28/SEP/11
7702|Grants Head Formation|Structure and Metamorphism|The Grants Head Formation has an average dip of 10 towards 320.|28/SEP/11
7702|Grants Head Formation|Age reasons|Helby (1972) examined a sample which yielded 10 species of palynomorphs from the northern end of Bartletts Beach (location 104), 63 m from the base of the formation. Bocking (1977) also collected samples from this location and identified Dicroidium dubium var. australe (Jacob & Jacob) Retallack. Holmes and Ash (1979) collected and identified more species from the same location. Both the palynology and megaflora samples suggest a late Early Triassic age for the Grants Head Formation.|28/SEP/11

7886|Gundahl Complex|Type section locality|Representative Section: Along the Nymboida and Mann rivers (GR 5900 0900 to GR 5385 1662 Gundahl and GR 5475 2040 Gundahl to GR 4790 3710 Coombadjha) there are abundant and in places near continuous exposures.|
7886|Gundahl Complex|Extent|The unit is exposed over 500 km2 in the eastern part of the Grafton 1:250 000 Sheet area (SH 56-6) along the Mann River to the northwest and south of Jackadgery.|
7886|Gundahl Complex|Thickness range|The style of deformation precludes any reliable estimate of thickness. The Gundahl Complex is a tectonic melange with blocks embedded in a sheared matrix. Similar lithofacies and lithofacies sequences are found within blocks repeated throughout the unit implying an imbricate fault structure. Individual blocks may contain coherent sequences up to hundreds of metres thick.|
7886|Gundahl Complex|Lithology|Six main lithofacies of the unit include: massive greywacke, greywacke-argillite, argillite, interbedded argillite-tuff, bedded cherts and greenstones (I.e. alteread basic volcanics).|
7886|Gundahl Complex|Relationships and boundaries|Unconformably overlain by the Mesozoic Clarence-Moreton Basin. Intruded by the Dandahra Creek Granite and in part faulted against or intruded by a ring pluton of the Coombadjha Volcanic Complex (McPhie, 1982). Northeast contact with the Willowie Creek beds is a major fault. Contact with the Cunglebung Creek beds to the southwest is marked by laarge blocks of greywacke and chert of the Gundahl Complex and is probably faulted.|
7886|Gundahl Complex|Age reasons|Day et al. (1978, p.345) reported ooliths in greywackes from the Gundahl Complex near Jackadgery and suggested a correlation with similar greywackes in the Neranleigh-Fernvale beds and the Curtis Island Group of eastern Queensland. This implies a possible Early Carboniferous age for greywacke-bearing lithologies of the Gundahl Complex.|

24302|Gundillion Conglomerate|Type section locality|On ridge just south of stream, from GR 390402 (base) to 386401 (top) on Araluen sheet. Exposes about 150 m of coarse massive conglomerate at base becoming finer upwards, into pebbly arenite and coarse arenite.|
24302|Gundillion Conglomerate|Extent|Widespread in a longitudinal zone on Araluen 1:100 000 sheet from west of Majors Creek to southern border of map. Also present in north of Cobargo sheet, to the south of Araluen sheet.|
24302|Gundillion Conglomerate|Thickness range|Very variable from 0 m to 150 m, often over short distances.|
24302|Gundillion Conglomerate|Lithology|Typically a massive to very poorly bedded, reddish-purple poorly sorted, coarse polymict conglomerate. Clasts can be up to 1 m across, but usually 30 cm or less. Has a tendency to become finer upwards, with coarse arenite and pebbly arenite common at top of unit. Locally it may have a basal breccia which appears to represent a fossil soil or scree deposit.|
24302|Gundillion Conglomerate|Relationships and boundaries|Rests unconformably on Late Silurian De Drack Formation and Long Flat Volcanics. Overlain conformably by Long Swamp Creek Formation. The gradational contact with the Long Swamp Creek Formation is taken at the top of the highest conglomerate or pebbly arenite in the section. It also overlies unconformably the Braidwood Granite.|

24315|Ina Volcanics|Type section locality|Along east-west Burcher-Forbes road between 8.5 km and 5.5 km east of Burcher. Bottom contact with Manna Conglomerate does not outcrop. Top contact with Banar Formation sharply defined on the ground. 537857 (bottom) to 533857 (top) Forbes 1:250 000.|
24315|Ina Volcanics|Description at type locality|Along the type section N of the road, the contact between the Manna Conglomerate and the overlying rhyolite tuff porphyry of the Cowal Member of the Ina Volcanics is obscured by a few hundred metres of soil. Going westward and up-dip the section is as follows: a. Cowal Member - A massive coarse rhyolite tuff porphyry about 1000 thick. It consists of phenocrysts of quartz and feldspar in a sericitic groundmass. A small lens of tuff breccia containing angular dark grey aphanitic fragments occurs south of the road. b. Andesite - Between the rhyolite tuff to the east and fine clastics to the west along the type section and elsewhere, there is a soil covered area which the BMR aeromagnetic map shows to be a long magnetic ridge. From evidence mentioned later, this part of the section probably contains a very persistent andesite flow or flows. This andesitic horizon is evident from the magnetic maps as far south as east of West Wyalong and even Barmedman, and northwards it appears to finish at the northern boundary of the geological map as shown in Fig. 1. c. Overlying the interpreted andesite, and outcropping continuously to the north of the road, is a section of cherty shales, greenish tuffaceous rocks, silts and sands, and finally a thick sequence of siliceous shales. They are sharply overlain by the Banar Formation and the contact is exposed. This part of the sequence is about 1000 m thick. The topmost siliceous shales laterally along strike contain and grade into rhyolite tuff porphyry. These tuff bodies are in places very thin, but are up to about 100 m in thickness and 1000 m in strike length in max. size. They consist of quartz and feldspar phenocrysts set in a sericitic groundmass. They are characterised by fairly abundant irregular angular fragments of greyish shale or perhaps devitrified glass or pumice. These fragments are up to about 10 cm in size.  Along the horizon of the tuff there are also lenses of calcarenites, calcareous shales and sandstones with abundant crinoid stem remains. There are also dolerite sills. Along the type section the siliceous shales are overlain sharply by the Banar Formation.|
24315|Ina Volcanics|Extent|The unit is exposed for about 16 km along strike between Corringle and Burcher.|
24315|Ina Volcanics|Thickness range|About 2000 m.|
24315|Ina Volcanics|Lithology|The Ina Volcanics consist of a succession of rhyolite tuff porphyries, sandstones, andesites, shales and minor conglomerates which overlie the Weelah Formation in the north and the Manna Conglomerate in the south. There is considerable lateral facies variation in the Ina Volcanics. Notable along these are a number of andesite flows outcropping in the Nerang-Cowal State Forest and also shown up by aeromagnetics to occur in a few other places along strike.  The andesites in the forest are greenish, calcareous and generally fragmental. They contain small feldspar lath phenocrysts. There are abundant dark fine fragments up to 1 cm in size. Also in the Nerang Cowal State Forest, the sandstones overlying the Cowal Member in places grade into conglomerate. It is clear that the Ina Volcanics contain a complex of lithological types: shales, mudstones, acid volcanics, andesitic volcanics, sandstones, conglomerates and carbonates.|23/APR/09

26269|Jolly Nose Conglomerate|Name source|The Jolly Nose Conglomerate was first identified and mapped by Bocking (1977), then formally
named and described by Leitch and Bocking (1980). It is named after the Jolly Nose Hill, a prominent peak in the immediate area of the type section.|
26269|Jolly Nose Conglomerate|Geomorphic expression|The Jolly Nose Conglomerate crops out poorly; most outcrops are moderately to highly weathered.|27/SEP/11
26269|Jolly Nose Conglomerate|Type section locality|Leitch and Bocking (1980) nominated the type section to be on the south side of Jolly Nose Hill between GR 480537 6505540 and GR 480433 6505873 (1:25 000 map sheet 9434-1-N, Grants Head) (locations 79 and 76; all locations are listed in Appendix 1). They also indicated more accessible exposures on the former Pacific Highway (location 20) and at Cowarra quarry (location 21). There was insufficient exposure at the type section to construct a measured section.|
26269|Jolly Nose Conglomerate|Description at type locality|Leitch and Bocking (1980 p.93) comprehensively described the Jolly Nose Conglomerate. `Massive
and rudaceous rocks dominate the Jolly Nose Conglomerate. These are mainly well rounded
cobble conglomerates with an open framework and a coarse quartz sandstone matrix. The unit is characterised by the presence of mainly poorly-indurated quartz sandstone clasts, in contrast with the Laurieton Conglomerate in which most clasts are composed of chert, jasper and vein quartz. Frequently pebbly and sometimes cross-stratified quartz sandstones occur in the Jolly Nose Conglomerate.|
26269|Jolly Nose Conglomerate|Extent|The Jolly Nose Conglomerate has a limited extent occurring only in the northeastern part of the
Lorne Basin, east of the North Coast Railway line and north of Herons Creek and Queens Lake.|27/SEP/11
26269|Jolly Nose Conglomerate|Thickness range|Leitch and Bocking (1980) estimated a thickness of 100 m for the Jolly Nose Conglomerate at the
type section while the author estimates a thickness of over 140 m at a nearby section (locations
38 to 78). However the formation thins rapidly to the northwest, with a total thickness of 5 m at
Cowarra Quarry (location 21) and an observed thickness of 2 m and estimated thickness of about
8 m at the former Pacific Highway (location 20).|
26269|Jolly Nose Conglomerate|Lithology|The author examined about 30 thin sections from the former Pacific Highway location (location 20) where the clasts are least weathered. The clast lithology of the Jolly Nose Conglomerate was found to be very varied, being dominated (about 80%) by lithic and quartzofeldspathic sandstone comparable with those of the Carboniferous Pappinbarra Formation and Mingaletta Formation. Although other lithologies present include granitoids, quartzite and acid volcanic rocks, sources for all clasts can be found in basin floor rocks within the basin perimeter. The more exotic clasts may have been reworked from the Carboniferous conglomerates. This localised provenance is markedly different from the provenance of the Triassic strata higher in the sequence where chert, quartz and jasper dominate. The conglomerates are cobble-rich as shown at the type section (location 79), east of Jolly Nose Hill (location 38), Pacific Park (location 20) and at Cowarra Quarry (location 21).|
26269|Jolly Nose Conglomerate|Relationships and boundaries|The Jolly Nose Conglomerate is the lowest Triassic formation in the Lorne Basin and, where present, unconformably overlies the Palaeozoic basement rocks, as at location 20 (on the former
Pacific Highway), where the formation can be seen directly overlying Palaeozoic serpentinite. In the Jolly Nose Hill area, the formation is overlain by the Laurieton Conglomerate, as at locations 76 and 78 (Photograph 1). Further south, at location 147; and west, as at locations 20 and 21, the formation is overlain by the Coopernook Conglomerate Member of the Camden Head Claystone.|
26269|Jolly Nose Conglomerate|Identifying features|The Jolly Nose Conglomerate is readily identified by its cobble clast lithology of predominantly
(about 80%) lithic and quartzo-feldspathic sandstones and the rarity or absence of quartz, jasper or
chert clasts. The formation crops out poorly and immediately overlies the Palaeozoic basin floor.|
26269|Jolly Nose Conglomerate|Structure and Metamorphism|The formation appears to fill a graben in the eastern floor of the basin and thins rapidly westwards beyond this depression.|
26269|Jolly Nose Conglomerate|Age reasons|The age of the Jolly Nose Conglomerate is uncertain as no fossils have been recovered from the
formation although shelly fossils were recovered from a constituent cobble. Thin section analysis
of these fossils indicated that they were bivalves (rather than brachiopods) and of similar shape and size to the bivalves of the `Merismopteria'  horizon in the Late Carboniferous Mingaletta
Formation from which it is thought the cobble was derived. The formation is assumed to unconformably overlie the Middle Ordovician to Late Carboniferous Watonga Formation, and is observed to overlie Palaeozoic serpentinite. The formation is overlain, in part, by the Laurieton Conglomerate which is constrained by macroflora to an Early Triassic age. The Jolly Nose Conglomerate is probably Early Triassic or perhaps Late Permian in age.|
26269|Jolly Nose Conglomerate|Correlations|There are no other units in the Lorne Basin that can be correlated with the Jolly Nose Conglomerate.|

24328|Kalimna Limestone Member|Identifying features|Definition: Originally referred to informally as the 'lower coral' unit (Webby 1969), the Kalimna Limestone Member of the Fossil Hill Limestone also has its type section on Fossil Hill (GR 752812*). The name derives from the property of Kalimna (GR 737812*), some 1.5 km north-west of the type locality. In the type section the Kalimna Limestone Member is 9 m thick. There is a relatively sharp contact in the section between topmost Gleesons Limestone Member (beds with large-shelled Eodinobolus) and the basal Kalimna Limestone Member (a 320 mm thick siltstone). The succeeding 7.5 m of sequence is thin bedded, and composed of skeletal wackestones and packstones with silty interbeds. A thin bed containing large Eodinobolus shells forms the top of this sequence, and is succeeded directly by distinctive 1.2 m thick coral/algal/stromatoporoid biostrome. The top of the Kalimna Limestone Member is taken 0.75 m above the biostrome at a significant lithological change from grey brown skeletal wackestones with abundant corals to greenish brown, volcaniclastic, fine sandstones of the overlying Wyoming Limestone Member. The Kalimna Limestone Member has been mapped as an independent unit throughtout the Cliefden Caves area, distinguished across less well-exposed ground by the prominence and continuity in its beds of large colonies of Tetradium cribriforme.

25970|Khan Yunis Formation|Unit history|The name was first used by Johnson (1964, M.Sc. Thesis ANU) but the only published use of the name was by McIlveen (1975, Rec. geol. Survey NSW 16(3) p.268) who briefly mentioned it without description.|
25970|Khan Yunis Formation|Type section locality|To the southeast of Khan Yunis homestead from GR 400245 (base) to 382245 (top). Outcrop along the section is only fair, however the unit as a whole forms poor outcrop. About 500 m of sediment is present in the type section.|
25970|Khan Yunis Formation|Extent|In a meridional belt some 17 km long and up to 2 km wide on the western side of the Shoalhaven valley from the southern edge of the Araluen sheet. A small area is present in the north of the Cobargo sheet.|
25970|Khan Yunis Formation|Thickness range|A maximum of 550 m.|
25970|Khan Yunis Formation|Lithology|Interbedded yellowish-brown to reddish-brown medium to coarse arenite, reddish-brown siltstone and red shale. Conglomeratic and pebbly arenite horizons fairly common. Cross-bedding is common. Beds organised into fining-upwards cycles typical of fluviatile environments.|
25970|Khan Yunis Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The unit rests conformably, with gradational contact, on the Deua Formation. The top of the unit is everywhere a faulted contact against the Devonian Jinden Granite and the Silurian Long Flat Volcanics.|
25970|Khan Yunis Formation|Age reasons|A rich fish fauna is known from one locality near the base of the Khan Yunis Formation. It indicates a Fammenian (Late Devonian) age for the unit.|

24337|Kingsland Conglomerate Member|Extent|The unit is distribuated over a distance of 25 km from the NE corner of the Horton 1:100 000 geological series (McKelvey & White 1964) and the E margin of the Bangheet 1:100 000  series (McKelvey, 1968).|
24337|Kingsland Conglomerate Member|Thickness range|Range 40-60 m.|
24337|Kingsland Conglomerate Member|Lithology|Orthoconglomerate, sandstone, siltstone and pebbly mudstone with minor lithographic limestone and mudstone.|
24337|Kingsland Conglomerate Member|Relationships and boundaries|Lies within the Mandowa Mudstone - previously this conglomerate was referred to the Keepit Conglomerate by McKelvey & White (1964) and McKelvey (1968). The upper contact is at the highest coarse sandstone, conglomerate or pebbly mudstone. The lower contact is defined in a similar manner but may have an abrupt as well as gradational lower contact.|
24337|Kingsland Conglomerate Member|Age reasons|Siphonodella duplicata, an early Tournaisian conodont species is present in a limestone boulder 6.5 m below the top of the type section. Siphonodella sp. Is also present 20 cm below this unit 3 km SW of the type section on the southern side of the Horton Road. No other macro or microfauna is known from this unit.|
24337|Kingsland Conglomerate Member|Comments|Remarks: This conglomerate has been renamed for the following reasons:  1) The underlying Eungai Mudstone cannot be lithologically distinguished from the overlying Mandowa Mudstone (and is hence placed into synonomy with the Mandowa).  2) There is a significant age difference between the Keepit Conglomerate (latae Devonian) and the newly named Kingsland Conglomerate (early Carboniferous) as well as lack of outcrop of both conglomerate units between Burindi and Horton (a distance of 47 km).|

24343|Koreelah Conglomerate Member|Name source|The name is derived from the small settlement of old Koreelah in north-eastern NSW (GR MP 435.585 Warwick 1:100 000 Sheet).|
24343|Koreelah Conglomerate Member|Unit history|The Koreelah Conglomerate Member has been previously included in either the Marburg 'Formation' or the Laytons Range Conglomerate.|
24343|Koreelah Conglomerate Member|Geomorphic expression|Mostly poorly exposed in low mounds or in road cuttings.|
24343|Koreelah Conglomerate Member|Type section locality|The type section lies in an area about 10 km to the southwest of Warwick along the New England Highway, at GR LP 978.702, on the Allora 1:100 0000 Sheet. There are no continuous complete sections of the Koreelah Conglomerate Member and the best outcrops are those along road cuttings on the New England and Bruxner Highways. The base of the Member in the type section is present in outliers and at the basin margin east and southeast of the Leslie Hall Dam such as outcrops at LP 963.784 and outcrops on the Cunningham Highway 15-17 km west of Warwick. The top of the member grades into the Gatton Sandstone between the exposures on the New England Highway and a quarry in the Gatton Sandstone at MP 002.708.|
24343|Koreelah Conglomerate Member|Description at type locality|The member is composed of conglomerate, sandstone, siltstone and shale. Pebble to cobble conglomerate is the dominant lithology in most outcrops but the relative proportion of rock types varies considerably from one outcrop to another. The predominantly clast supported conglomerate is polymict with mostly subrounded and a few angular and rounded clasts mostly in the range 3-5 cm across, and a maximum of 16 cm, composed of predominantly mudstone metasediments, with subordinate black chert, felsic volcanics, fine grained sandstone, slatey metasediaments and reef quartz in a matrix of coarse grained sandstone containing fresh angular feldspar grains. The conglomerate is both matrix anda clast supported, has poorly defined bedding, including trough crossbeds, and in a few places the clasts show a slight imbrication. Fine and coarse grained lithic and feldspathic sandstone occurs as interbeds of variable thickness. Red and grey siltstone is interbedded in some of the conglomerate exposures. In places the mudstone encloses lenses of conglomerate and coarse grained sandstone up to 2 to 3 m thick.|
24343|Koreelah Conglomerate Member|Extent|The member is found chiefly in narrow strips along the western and parts of the southern margin of the Clarence Moreton Basin. The Koreelah Conglomerate Member is distributed along the western and southern margins of the basin on the Cunningham and New England Highways, west and south of Warwick, on the Bruxner Highway west of Tabulam, Gwydir Highway west of Main Creek and probably also on the Pacific Highway at the Dirty Creek Range.  The known maximum exposed thickness is about 20-30 m in the area west of Tabulam on the Bruxner Highway.|03/DEC/09
24343|Koreelah Conglomerate Member|General description|The proportion of conglomerate, sandstone, and fine grained rocks varies from locality to locality and in places shales and fine sandstones are present in the sequence. Ferruginised and siliceous fossil wood, logs and fragments are common. The formation typically occurs as a pebble-cobble conglomerate, with abundant coarse sandstone interbeds and a similar sandy matrix. The lithology of the clasts in the conglomerate is controlled largely by the composition of the underlying basement. The known maximum exposed thickness is about 20-30 m in the area west of Tabulam on the Bruxner Highway.|
24343|Koreelah Conglomerate Member|Thickness range|Only incomplete sections are present in outcrop and about 20-30 m on the Bruxner Highway (GR 470.030 Drake 1:100 000 Sheet) is the maximum known exposed thickness. About 5 m of conglomerate penetrated in GSQ Ipswich RM2 at Leyburn probably equates with the Koreelah Conglomerate Member.  The true thickness is probably much greater but exposure is discontinuous.|
24343|Koreelah Conglomerate Member|Depositional environment|Probably deposited as a series of alluvial fans and braided stream deposits along the western and southern margins of the Clarence Moreton Basin.|
24343|Koreelah Conglomerate Member|Fossils|The member has no internal evidence for depositional age. Superposition and lateral relationships indicate that the member has approximately the same age as the Early Jurassic Gatton Sandstone of the Marburg Subgroup.|
24343|Koreelah Conglomerate Member|Diastems or hiatuses|Evidence for minor hiatusus and diastems is present.|
24343|Koreelah Conglomerate Member|Relationships and boundaries|The member unconformably overlies Palaeozoic and Early Triassic basement rocks, and is inferred to overlie Late Triassic sediments of the Bundamba Group. The member occurs at the local base of the Marburg Sub-group and is interpreted to grade laterally into the Gatton Sandstone, and doubtfully into the Heifer Creek Sandstone of the Marburg Sub-group. Precise boundaries are not readily defined due to lateral and vertical facies transitions. Lateral and vertical boundaries may be defined by the last significant beds of pebble conglomerate in the unit. Contacts are rarely observed and are typically gradational.|
24343|Koreelah Conglomerate Member|Identifying features|The combination of pebble-cobble conglomerate and coarse grained arenitic assemblage in the member distinguishes it from the bulk of the basin sequence. The Late Triassic basal conglomerates of the basin (Laytons Range, Corindi and Aberdare Conglomerates) are superficially similar to the Koreelah Conglomerate Member; however there is usually a higher proportion of sandstone interbedded in the Koreelah Conglomerate Member, and it is distinguished in many places by the abundance of fossil wood. The sandstone interbeds are lithologically similar to those of the Gatton Sandstone. It is not always easy to distinguish the basal Late Triassic conglomerates from those in the Early Jurassic, and in some instances a demonstration of lateral transition to the Marburg Subgroup is the surest way of distinguishing the two.|
24343|Koreelah Conglomerate Member|Structure and Metamorphism|The Koreelah Conglomerate Member generally dips at low angles into the basin.|
24343|Koreelah Conglomerate Member|Correlations|There are no units that can be correlated lithologically and temporally with the Koreelah Conglomerate Member. The Koreelah Conglomerate Member is laterally continuous with the Gatton Sandstone of the Marburg Subgroup.|
24343|Koreelah Conglomerate Member|Proposed publication|Wells A.T. et al. BMR Journal of Geology and Geophysics|
24343|Koreelah Conglomerate Member|Comments|Discussion:  The evidence for the existence of the younger conglomerate and the reasons for proposing a new member name may be summarised as follows. (1) The conglomerate occurs in the exposed base of the Marburg Subgroup along the western and southern margins of the basin. In this area the Subgroup ovelaps the older formations in the basin and unconformably overlies Palaeozoic and Early Triassic basement rocks.  (2) The Marburg Subgroup shows evidence of general coarsening towards the basin margin and the proportion and thickness of conglomerate interbeds increase towards the margin.  (3) The clast composition is noticeably different in some areas to that found in the Laytons Range, Aberdare, and Corindi Conglomerates, and fossil wood commonly constitutes a large percentage of these clasts.  (4) The sandstone interbeds found in the conglomerate are similar in composition to those found in the Marburg Subgroup.  (5) The basal conglomerate member is apparently continuous with the Marburg Subgroup; no unconformity is apparent between the Marburg Subgroup and the conglomerate member which would be expected if an overlapping relationship existed.  (6) The suggested identification of the conglomerate present locally at the base of the Marburg Subgroup in contact with the Raceview Formation in the southeast provides additional evidence for the age and stratigraphic position of the member.|

9839|Koukandowie Formation|Name source|From Koukandowie Mountain (Trig Station), (MM 874.824, Grafton 1:100 000 sheet 9438) at the southern margin of the Clarence-Moreton Basin.|
9839|Koukandowie Formation|Unit history|The unit name is derived from the Koukandowie 'Sandstone Member' of the 'Marburg Formation' as published by McElroy (1962). The Formation composes the younger of the two units of the Marburg Subgroup defined in this paper.|
9839|Koukandowie Formation|Constituents|Two members, the Heifer Creek Sandstone Member and the Ma Ma Creek Member occur within the Koukandowie Formation. In many areas the members cannot be identified, and under the revised stratigraphic scheme the sequence is referred to as undivided Koukandowie Formation.|
9839|Koukandowie Formation|Type section locality|Reference Section: No type section was given for the Koukandowie Sandstone Member by McElroy. Gray (1975) subsequently nominated the interval in GSQ Ipswich 18 from 203'5" (62.0 m) - 1368'4" (417.07 m) as the reference section for the interval equivalent to the Koukandowie Formation.  Type Section: The interval from 811.15 m to 1070.63 m in GSQ Ipswich 24 is here nominated as the type section, as it is considered that the reference section in GSQ Ipswich 18 is atypical and the boundaries with adjacent units are not readily defined.|
9839|Koukandowie Formation|Description at type locality|In the type section in GSQ Ipswich 24 the Koukandowie Formation contains about 67% sandstone. The Ma Ma Creek Member contains 54% shale and siltstone whereas the undifferentiated Koukandowie Formation contain 80% sandstone. The sandstone in the undifferentiated upper part of the Koukandowie Formation is fine to coarse grained, commonly in stacked multistorey fining up sequences about 10 m thick in the upper part of the formation and up to 40 m thick in the lower part. The sandstone is mostly cross laminated and rippled. Thin pebble conglomerates occur at the base of channel sands. Interbedded mudstone intervals are 10-12 m thick with fine grained sandstone laminae, cross laminae and rootlets. In places the mudstone exhibits brecciated soil textures. The formation is 259.48 m thick in GSQ Ipswich 24. The description of the Ma Ma Creek Member in GSQ Ipswich 24 is detailed separately.|
9839|Koukandowie Formation|Extent|The formation has been identified throughout the Clarence Moreton Basin, wherever the Marburg Subgroup is identified. The Koukandowie Formation has been identified in most deep well sections; in the southern Clarence-Moreton Basin it has been continuously cored in Pillar Valley DDH2 stratigraphic drill hole and corresponds to the 'Upper Marburg Formation' of Etheridge et al., (1985).|
9839|Koukandowie Formation|Depositional environment|The upper part of the Heifer Creek Formation in GSQ Ipswich 24 was laid down as predominantly channel deposits, with flood plain siltstone interspersed with probable fining up crevasse splay sandstones. The lower part of the formation - the Ma Ma creek Member - was deposited in lacustrine conditions with deposition of mainly claystone and shale with chamositic oolite.|
9839|Koukandowie Formation|Fossils|The formation contains plant fossils and fossil wood and palynomorphs.|
9839|Koukandowie Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The boundaries of the formation with other units is conformable. The upper boundary of the Koukandowie Formation corresponds to the description of the change of sandstone composition described under the Marburg Subgroup. The lower boundary of the formation is defined as the change from predominantly mudrocks of the Ma Ma Creek Member to the multistory medium to very coarse grained, quartz-lithic to lithic sandstone bodies of the Gatton Sandstone. Where the Ma Ma Creek Member is not recognisable the boundary is the change from the variable sandstone/siltstone/shale sequence of the Koukandowie Formation to the uniform quartz-feldspathic-lithic sandstone and subordinate conglomerate of the Gatton Sandstone.|
9839|Koukandowie Formation|Identifying features|The sandstone composition, lithological assemblages and associations, and stratigraphic position are the main methods for distinguishing the formation. The characteristics and sequences in the constituent members, where they are identifiable, can also be used to distinguish the formation. Most of the attributes of the formation are shown on the graphic log of GSQ Ipswich 24. The sandstones of the Koukandowie Formation are quartzose to quartz-lithic in composition with silty and clayey matrix and varying amounts of channel base conglomerate and overbank shale. The lithological sequence penetrated in GSQ Ipswich 24 is characteristic of the formation.|
9839|Koukandowie Formation|Age reasons|The formation contains plant fossils, fossil wood, spores, pollen grains and sporadic acritarchs. The Koukandowie Formation contains palynofloras similar to those formed in the lower Eurombah Formation, Hutton Sandstone and the post-oolite ironstone section of the upper Evergreen Formation of the Surat Basin. The age of the palynoflora is late Toarcian to early Bajocian interpreted principally from McKallar (1974), and McKellor (1981).|
9839|Koukandowie Formation|Correlations|The Koukandowie Formation is broadly correlated with the Hutton Sandstone of the Surat Basin sequence.|

24349|Kyong Formation|Thickness range|Ranges between 180 m and 860 m.|
24349|Kyong Formation|Lithology|Comprises psammitic to pelitic metasediments with various amounts (but greater than 10%) of quartzofeldspathic gneisses as an essential component. The quartzofeldspathic gneisses include leucocratic and biotite rich varieties, and sillimanite- and feldspar megacryst-bearing types. Minor beds of basic gneiss, stratiform, granular feruginous and cupriferous quartz rock, garnet quartz rock, and poorly layered calc-silicate rock occur sparsely throughout.|
24349|Kyong Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The base is defined by a broad interval of metasediment in sharp contact with a persistent body of quartzofeldspathic gneiss (Alma Gneiss). The top is defined by a sharp contact with a laterally persistant body of quartzofeldspathic gneiss in excess of 70 m thick (Rasp Ridge Gneiss), or by an interval rich in leucocratic plagioclase-quartz rocks (Himalaya Formation). Is laterally transitional to metasediment rich Cues Formation in places, and is locally underlain by same. Locally interfingers with Alma Gneiss and Broken Hill Group. Is locally vertically transitional to Allandale Metasediments.|
24349|Kyong Formation|Age reasons|Structurally and lithologically part of the Willyama Supergroup of Early Proterozoic age, approximately 1820 Ma (Shaw 1968).|

25988|Lanes Shaft Coal Member|Lithology|Coal dull, very uniform; common fusain lenses; clayey in part; two claystone butt to grey, possibly tuffaceous bands, a few centimetres thick occur in upper half of unit; one mudstone band, buff to grey, possibly tuffaceous, 0.91 m thick, in lower half of unit; coal becomes very clayey towards base, where it grades into mudstone or claystone, dark brown to black, carbonaceous.|
25988|Lanes Shaft Coal Member|Relationships and boundaries|Top part of the Narrow Plain Formation (Palese and Morgan, in prep.); it conformably overlies claystones and sandstones of the Formation. The base is defined by the gradational change from coal to carbonaceous mudstone or claystone. It is unconformably overlain by the Loughmore Formation (Palese and Morgan, in prep.).|
25988|Lanes Shaft Coal Member|Age reasons|Impressions of Vertebraria and Glossopteris are common on the coal bedding planes. The microflora, as identified in the thin claystone buff bands, consists mainly of Luekisporites and Parasaccites. Elements such as Didecitriletes ericianus, Marsupipollensis sinuosus and Dulhunryispora dulhuntyi, identify the Lower Stage 5 microflora of Late Permian age (? Roadian).|

10240|Laurieton Conglomerate|Name source|Town of Laurieton 31deg39' 00.71"S, 152deg47' 53.44"E. The Laurieton Conglomerate was noted by Carne (1897) and Voisey (1939) and formally named by Pratt and Herbert (1973) after Laurieton, the nearest town to the major outcrops.|28/SEP/11
10240|Laurieton Conglomerate|Geomorphic expression|The Laurieton Conglomerate is a resistant, cliff-forming unit well-exposed along the coast between Camden Head and Grants Head and on the eastern and southern sides of Jolly Nose Hill.|28/SEP/11
10240|Laurieton Conglomerate|Type section locality|Grants Head - Bonny Hills.  Location of Type Section: Grants Head-Bonny Hills 915895 Camden Haven 1:63 360.|12/NOV/10
10240|Laurieton Conglomerate|Type section locality|Grants Head from 31.61034deg S, 152.84715deg E to 31.59803deg S, 152.84719deg E. Pratt and Herbert (1973) nominated the exposure at Grants Head as the type section for the Laurieton Conglomerate. A precise location at Grants Head, between GR 485501 6503744 (1:25 000 map sheet 9434-1-N, Grants Head, location 90, Photograph 4), and GR 485504 6504108 (1:25 000 map sheet), 9434-1-N, Grants Head, location 31) is now specified as the location of the type section. This is a complete and unbroken section with exposures of both the base and the top of the formation. The base of the formation is exposed at the foot of the cliff at GR 485501 6503744 (location 90). The section then offsets along the bed to GR 485567 6503949 (location 117) from where the section continues up-dip along the rock platform to the base of the overlying Grants Head
Formation at GR 485504 6504108 (location 31, Photograph 5). A lithology plot of the Laurieton
Conglomerate measured section is presented in Figure 12.|28/SEP/11
10240|Laurieton Conglomerate|Description at type locality|The type section for the conglomerate is exposed in cliffs and then along the rock platform on the
northern side of Grants Head. Pratt and Herberts (1973) original description has been revised to: the Laurieton Conglomerate is dominated by reddish to grey, poorly to moderately sorted pebble to cobble conglomerate usually with very thick (>100 cm) beds, as exposed on the southern side of Grants Head (location 342); (Photograph 6). Pebble and minor granule conglomerate and sandstone interbeds are uncommon and beds of reddish purple mudstone are absent. The
subrounded to subangular clasts are predominantly chert with lesser jasper and quartz. The fabric
is clast-supported and the matrix is poorly sorted sandstone to claystone. Bedding is generally very thick with some minor thick-bedded strata.|
10240|Laurieton Conglomerate|Extent|The Laurieton Conglomerate is developed as isolated headlands around the northeastern
perimeter of the Lorne Basin, as well as an upfolded exposure at the Jolly Nose Hill.|28/SEP/11
10240|Laurieton Conglomerate|Extent|Crops out around basin perimeter in the east of the basin and around Jolly Nose Hill, also in the east.|
10240|Laurieton Conglomerate|General description|While the type section description for the Laurieton Conglomerate is consistent with most other
exposures, at Little Grants Head, 800 m southwest of the type section, there is a distinct decrease
in clast size with pebble and granule conglomerate dominating. There is also a change in the
relative proportions of quartz to jasper clasts, although jasper clasts still predominate over quartz
clasts, a characteristic of the Laurieton Conglomerate.|
10240|Laurieton Conglomerate|Thickness range|At the type section the Laurieton Conglomerate is almost 47 m thick. There is an observed
thickness of approximately 60 m at Jolly Nose Trigonometric Station but at that location the top of the unit is not exposed and hence the true thickness is greater.|28/SEP/11
10240|Laurieton Conglomerate|Lithology| At the type section, jasper clasts comprise 33% and quartz clasts 20% of the total clasts and 12 cobbles per 0.5 m  0.5m square, while the average of 15 samples (100 pebbles each) throughout the basin was jasper 30% and quartz 20% of total clasts and 6 cobbles per 0.5 m  0.5 m square.
Jasper clasts usually comprise >25% of total clasts while quartz clasts are usually <25% and there
are usually more than 3 cobbles per 0.5  0.5 m square. Table 3 presents the jasper and quartz
clast percentages of total clasts measured at 11 locations. The significant proportion of chert and jasper clasts is typical of the New England Orogen provenance and is also typical of the Triassic strata in the Gunnedah Basin (Digby Conglomerate) and northern Sydney Basin (Munmorah Conglomerate).|28/SEP/11
10240|Laurieton Conglomerate|Lithology|Pebble to cobble conglomerate with minor granule conglomerate, sandstone and red-brown claystone.|12/NOV/10
10240|Laurieton Conglomerate|Depositional environment|For the Laurieton Conglomerate the very thick bedding, crude cross stratification, clast-supported
framework; poor to moderate sorting, and the subrounded to subangular clasts and their pebble
to cobble size, indicate rapid deposition in a high-energy environment from a source of abundant supply. These features would suggest deposition in the main channel areas of a braided stream subject to periods of major flooding. Parisotto (1989, p.116) noted that sheetflood deposits and braided streams are most common in the mid-alluvial fan region. He concluded that `the Laurieton
Conglomerate was deposited in a mid-alluvial fan environment that was relatively flat and dominated by water-laid deposits, in particular those by sheetfloods.|28/SEP/11
10240|Laurieton Conglomerate|Relationships and boundaries|The Laurieton Conglomerate overlies the Camden Head Claystone with an erosive contact.
However, in the Jolly Nose Hill area, the Camden Head Claystone and Coopernook Conglomerate Member are (locally) absent and there the Laurieton Conglomerate overlies the Jolly Nose Conglomerate (Map 1 and Figure 2). Poorly developed bedding in both units and their coarse cobble grainsize rendered the nature of the contact indeterrminate, but it is presumed to be paraconformable. The Laurieton Conglomerate is conformably overlain by the Grants Head Formation. The basal boundary of the Laurieton Conglomerate is the contact between the chertjasper and quartz cobble and pebble conglomerate of the Laurieton Conglomerate and the reddish purple mudstone of the underlying Camden Head Claystone or, in the immediate vicinity of Jolly Nose Hill, the lithofeldspathic sandstone cobble conglomerate of the Jolly Nose Conglomerate. The
top of the formation is the top of the uppermost bed of chertjasperquartz pebble conglomerate
underlying the pebbly sandstone of the Grants Head Formation.|28/SEP/11
10240|Laurieton Conglomerate|Relationships and boundaries|Overlies and in part laterally equivalent to the Camden Head Claystone. In some areas rests unconformably on Palaeozoic basement. Overlain by the Grants Head Formation.|12/NOV/10
10240|Laurieton Conglomerate|Identifying features|The distinguishing features of the Laurieton Conglomerate are the abundant cobbles, poor
sorting and dominantly very thick (>100 cm) beds. Jasper clasts usually constitute >30% and
quartz clasts usually <25%. There are generally more than 5 cobbles per 0.5 m  0.5 m square.
Beds of reddish purple mudstone are absent. The formation crops out strongly; is often cliffforming;
and is characterised by the very thick beds of the dominating conglomerate so wellexposed in the coastal cliffs and at Jolly Nose Hill.|28/SEP/11
10240|Laurieton Conglomerate|Structure and Metamorphism|The Laurieton Conglomerate has been folded into northsouth-trending open folds with a final
basin-ward dip from the westernmost anticline (Map 1 and Figure 2).|28/SEP/11
10240|Laurieton Conglomerate|Age reasons|Lower Triassic - age data from surrounding formations.|12/NOV/10
10240|Laurieton Conglomerate|Age reasons|Although fossils have not been recovered from the Laurieton Conglomerate, palynological samples from the Camden Head Claystone, 9 m below the Laurieton Conglomerate and from the Grants Head Formation at Bartletts Beach, 63 m above the Laurieton Conglomerate (location 104) place the formation in a transitional zone between the underlying Protohaploxypinus samoilovichii Assemblage and the Aratrisporites tenuispinosus Assemblage (Helby 1970, 1971, 1972). These floras are found in the Terrigal Formation, and underlying Clifton Subgroup, of the Sydney Basin and suggest an upper Early Triassic age for the Laurieton Conglomerate.|28/SEP/11
10240|Laurieton Conglomerate|Correlations|Pratt and Herbert (1973) considered the Laurieton Conglomerate to include the conglomerates
of the Lansdowne Escarpment, Mount Comboyne and Broken Bago Range. However, those
conglomerates are shown herein to be the Coopernook Conglomerate Member of the Camden
Head Claystone. The conglomerates overlying the Camden Head Claystone are sufficiently
different from the Laurieton Conglomerate to warrant their description as a separate new formation, the Coorabakh Conglomerate, albeit laterally equivalent to the former.|28/SEP/11

10619|Long Flat Volcanics|Name source|"Long Flat" property, GR 431604, Araluen 1:100 000 sheet.|
10619|Long Flat Volcanics|Unit history|Anderson (1893) briefly described the "Long Flat Porphyry". Kennedy (1961) used the term "Manar Group" for the unit and divided it into four subunits (only one of which occurs on the Braidwood sheet. The term "Long Flat Volcanics" was used informally by Johnson (1964) to describe a sequence of volcanic rocks in the vicinity of Krawaree (GR 266577, Canberra 1:250 000 sheet).|
10619|Long Flat Volcanics|Type section locality|The Long Flat Volcanics are exposed at intervals along the Boro-Bunnerong road between GR 447058 and GR 479032 (Braidwood 1:100 000 sheet). Outcrops in creeks are very weathered and are seen to be strongly cleaved, with phenocrysts of quartz standing out from a fine groundmass on the weathered surfaces. In areas of higher relief near GR 479032 fresh specimens of dark grey green porphyritic dacite and dacitic tuff can be obtained from outcrops above the left bank of Boro Creek.|
10619|Long Flat Volcanics|Extent|The main part of the unit crops out over an area of 550 km2, between Boro (GR 424078, Braidwood 1:100 000 sheet) in the north and Kain (GR 324423, Araluen 1:100 000 sheet) in the south. Discontinuous outcrops continue south for about 10 km.|
10619|Long Flat Volcanics|Thickness range|Not known; of the order of 2000 m.|
10619|Long Flat Volcanics|Lithology|Porphyritic dacite and dacitic tuff; minor rhyolite.|
10619|Long Flat Volcanics|Relationships and boundaries|The eastern margin of the Long Flat Volcanics is an intrusive contact with the Early Devonian Braidwood Granite. In the west the unit is faulted against the Bombay Volcanics and, further north, against the Boro Granite. The relationship of the unit with adjacent Silurian sediments is obscure, but the two sequences may be partly time-equivalent. The Bombay and Long Flat Volcanics have similar petrographic characteristics but are distinguished in the field by differences in weathering behaviour. The Long Flat Volcanics form a mature, low-relief topography which includes the Shoalhaven River flood-plain west of Braidwood (GR 540740). By contrast, the Bombay Volcanics occupy a range of deeply dissected hills of maximum relief 200 metres.|
10619|Long Flat Volcanics|Age reasons|As indicated above, the relationship of the unit with the Silurian sediments (De Drack Formation of Middle to Late Silurian age) is obscure. The unit is no younger than mid-Early Devonian (the age of the Braidwood Granite). It is probably Middle to Late Silurian in age.|

27292|Long Swamp Creek Formation|Unit history|The name was previously used by Johnson (1964) in an unpublished ANU M.Sc. thesis.|
27292|Long Swamp Creek Formation|Type section locality|On east bank of Shoalhaven River from GR 404265 (base) to GR 401263 (top). About 100 m of interbedded shale and lithic arenite exposed.|
27292|Long Swamp Creek Formation|Extent|Extensive outcrops on the Minmurra Range, east of Shoalhaven River from Wyanbene to southern edge of Araluen Sheet.|
27292|Long Swamp Creek Formation|General description|Generally bioturbated. Several fining downward sandstone units. Sporadic acritarchs. Some flaser bedding. Sporadic "dropstones". Contains the "Bunnyong Sandstone" of Branagan (1960) at or near the top. Base of unit marked by transition from dark grey, commonly laminated, mudstone to coal, carbonaceous shale or sandstone of the Cullen Bullen Sub-Group.|
27292|Long Swamp Creek Formation|Thickness range|Varies from 50 m in south to 150 m locally to north.|
27292|Long Swamp Creek Formation|Lithology|Typically interbedded grey-brown mudstone and shale with lithic (at times feldspathic) quartz arenite. Rare red siltstone in south. Proportion of arenite to shale increases upwards through the unit.|
27292|Long Swamp Creek Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The Long Swamp Creek Formation rests conformably on the Gundillion Conglomerate, the contact being taken at the top of the highest conglomerate or pebbly arenite. It is overlain conformably, though with a sharp contact, by the Curmulee Conglomerate, or, when the Curmulee Conglomerate is absent, by the Deua Formation. The unit passes laterally to the north, about the latitude of Gundillion, into well bedded sandstone with only minor shale of the Big Hole Formation.|
27292|Long Swamp Creek Formation|Age reasons|The only fauna so far found are poorly preserved brachiopods from GR 421286, Araluen sheet, which cannot be identified. The age, from relationships with other units in the area, is considered to be Late Devonian.|

26011|Manna Conglomerate|Description at type locality|Several hundred metres of conglomerate just north of Burcher-Forbes road, 8.5 km east of Burcher. Bottom nowhere exposed. Top has sharp contact with overlying Cowal Member rhyolitic tuff.|
26011|Manna Conglomerate|Extent|The unit is exposed for at least 30 km strike on west side of Lake Cowal.|
26011|Manna Conglomerate|Thickness range|The formation is about 5000 m thick.|
26011|Manna Conglomerate|Lithology|The unit grades from coarse sandstone to a very coarse conglomerate with boulders 50 cm in diameter. It is generally massive and poorly bedded. The pebbles and boulders are very well rounded, consist of quartzite and quartz-sericite and are significantly flattened because of shearing. Although outcrops of conglomerate within the unit form visually impressive mountains, it seems that they constitute lenses of sheared and perhaps silicified rock within the formation. The poorly outcropping and non-outcropping areas within the boundaries of the formation are soft, recessive sandstones, non-resistant conglomerate and perhaps shales. Aeromagnetic maps of the area suggest that the Manna Conglomerate contains andesite flows and/or dolerite sills none of which are known to outcrop.|
26011|Manna Conglomerate|Relationships and boundaries|Underlying unit unknown; aeromagnetics suggest an andesitic sequence. Overlain by Ina Volcanics and Weelah Formation suggesting some change in depositional conditions.|

Typically bright coal in seams up to 7 m thick (about 10% of the sequence) are irregularly interbedded throughout. A sequence of silicified, laminated siltstones, with recorded thicknesses up to 10-15 m commonly occurs at the base of the formation in the Leard State Forest.|
11472|Maules Creek Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Overlies the Leard Formation (flint clay sediments) from which it is distinguished by distinctive clast petrology.

11773|Michelago Igneous Complex|Name source|The village of Michelago at GR 960460 (Michelago 1:100 000 Geological Sheet) on the Monaro Highway.|
11773|Michelago Igneous Complex|Unit history|Brown (1928) was the first to describe and name the Michelago Granite but his remarks are relevant only to the northern body. Best et al. (1964) published the name in reference to both northern and southern bodies. Slepecki (1973) made reference to the Michelago Batholith|
11773|Michelago Igneous Complex|Type section locality|Described under the different phase names i.e. Micaligo Adamellite, Koolambah Adamellite, Monkellan Granodiorite and Onslow Granodiorite.|
11773|Michelago Igneous Complex|Description at type locality|Described under the different phase names.|
11773|Michelago Igneous Complex|Extent|The complex lies to the east of the Monaro Highway and extends meridionally over some 32 km, from just north of the Bredbo River to near Mount Allan homestead at GR 001515. The mass has an average width of 4 km. In form the Michelago Complex actually consists of two distinct masses which have been subdivided into several phases. The Collingwood Fault separates the two bodies. Size: Southern body covers 32 km2 and the northern body covers 60 km2.|
11773|Michelago Igneous Complex|Relationships and boundaries|The complex has intruded Late Ordovician metasediments (Foxlow Beds). Very little contact metamorphism has taken place. In the vicinity of Collingwood homestead and Colinton Trig. Station, the Early Silurian Ryrie Formation and Late Silurian Cappanana Formation and Colinton Volcanics are faulted against the complex.|
11773|Michelago Igneous Complex|Age reasons|The Onslow Granodiorite has been successfully age dated by AMDEL. K-Ar analyses of biotite indicate an age of 395 +/- 8 m.y. This therefore indicates an age of intrusion of Late Silurian to Earliest Devonian for at least part of the complex.|

26052|Mount Fairy Group|Unit history|The term "Mount Fairy Series" was used by Garretty (1936) to describe Silurian rocks in the vicinity of Mount Fairy. In 1953, the name Mount Fairy Group was used to describe an undifferentiated sequence of shale, greywacke, sandstone, tuff and limestone on the Canberra 1:250 000 geological sheet 1st edn (Jooplin et al. 1953). The same sequence is termed "Mount Fairy Beds" on the 2nd edition (Best et al. 1964) and includes rocks now known to be Ordovician and Devonian in age.|

12887|Mount Lewin Limestone Member|Identifying features|The Mount Lewin Limestone Member was previously named informally as the 'grey' unit (Percival 1976; Osborne 1978). It is the upper of the two constituent members of the Vandon Limestone. The type section is situated in the upper reaches of Copper Mine Creek (GR 725797*), 550 m ESE of Malongulli Sugarloaf (Mount Lewin). The locality now known as Malongulli Sugarloaf is shown as 'Mount Lewin' on a copy of an early nineteenth century sketch map of the area reproduced in Carne & Jones (1919, p.7). The type section has been measured across the southern slopes of the creek in steeply dipping, massive grey burrow-mottled lime mudstones and wackestones. These beds are some 25.5 m thick, and overlain by an upper unit of thinly bedded fawn-grey wackestones, 3.5 m thick. These latter are the uppermost beds of the Vandon Limestone (and Cliefden Caves Limestone Group). They are succeeded, comparatively abruptly by 0.05-0.2 m thick beds of dark grey, laminated calcareous siltstones of the basal Malongulli Formation. The Mount Lewin Limestone Member has been mapped as an independent unit throughout the Cliefden Caves area and at Licking Hole Creek (Percival 1976).  (*Canowindra 1:50 000 sheet 8630 I & IV, edit 1 (1978)).|

29225|Mulculca Formation|Unit history|Shown as undifferentiated Thackaringa Group, and Cues formation by Willis et al. (1983). Part of "Redan gneiss" of Rayner (1949). Partly equivalent to "Mulculca rock unit association" of Corbett (1981).|
29225|Mulculca Formation|Type section locality|There is no exposed section sufficiently complete to be nominated as a type section. A type area is nominated in grid squares 7652 and 7553 Kinalung 1:25 000 Sheet. A reference area is nominated in grid squares 6443, 6444, 6544 and 6445 Redan 1:25 000 sheet.|
29225|Mulculca Formation|Description at type locality|The formation is characterised by a greater abundance of metasediments and/or metasedimentary composite gneisses than the underlying and overlying formations. The abundant albite-quartz (+/- magnetite) rocks in Mulculca Formation are similar to those in adjacent formations. Quartz-magnetite "lode" rocks are common near the top of Mulculca Formation, and are also known near the base. Other minor components of the formation include amphibolite/basic granulite, albite-quartz-amphibole rocks, and albite-quartz-magnetite gneiss.|
29225|Mulculca Formation|Extent|The formation crops out poorly, but is inferred to extend across the northern part of the Redan 1:25 000 sheet and across a substantial area of the Kinalung 1:25 000 sheet.|
29225|Mulculca Formation|Thickness range|Estimated at 1.5 km, but very approximate.|
29225|Mulculca Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The base is defined by an increase in the abundance of metasediments or metasedimentary composite gneiss, in comparison with the underlying Ednas Gneiss. This corresponds with a decrease in the abundance of albite-quartz-magnetite gneiss. The top is defined as where the metasediment (or metasedimentary composite gneiss) bearing association gives way to the albite-quartz rock/leucocratic gneiss/basic gneiss association of Lady Brassey Formation.|

26071|Nangahrah Formation|Thickness range|Indeterminate due to deformation and poor exposure.|
26071|Nangahrah Formation|Lithology|In places highly deformed. Local basalt overlain by ribbon-bedded, red chert up to 100 m thick. Above this argillite occurs interstratified with ?olistostromal deposits containing angular clasts, blocks and slabs of ribbon-bedded, red radiolarian chert, pillow basalt, and scarce limestone in a fine-grained matrix of basaltic rock fragments, chert and rather abundant angular quartz.|
26071|Nangahrah Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Thrust contacts, structurally overlying Bobs Creek Formation and structurally overlain by Woodsreef Ophiolitic Melange.|
26071|Nangahrah Formation|Age reasons|Radiolaria indicate a possible age range from Middle Devonian to Early Carboniferous.|

13911|Narrow Plain Formation|Extent|The formation occurs in the subsurface only. Its subcrop extends for at least 500 km2 in the central protion of Jerilderie 1:250 000 sheet and probably further north.|
13911|Narrow Plain Formation|Thickness range|Range 15 m to 35 m; lenses out towards the Eastern margin of the basin.|
13911|Narrow Plain Formation|Lithology|Coarse sediments such as conglomerate and sandstones, loosely cemented, consisting mainly of milky white or clear quartz and grey quartzite, occur mainly towards the middle and the base of the sequence. Finer sediments such as claystones and siltstones, brown or grey, micaceous, with coaly lamellae, occur especially towards the lower half of the formation, associated with the lower coal bearing sequence. In this sequence, coal occurs generally in two or more bands, up to 0.30 m thick, separated by claystones, carbonaceous and possibly tuffaceous. A thick coal band, the Lane's Shaft Coal Member, occurs at the top of the formation.|
13911|Narrow Plain Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Overlies the Permian Marine sediments; its basal conglomerate suggests unconformity. It is unconformably overlain by the Loughmore Formation (Palese and Morgan, in prep.). It includes the Lanes Shaft Coal Member (Palese and Morgan, in prep.) at top.|
13911|Narrow Plain Formation|Age reasons|Impressions of Glossopteris, Vertebraria and Noeggerathiopsis can be observed on bedding planes. The microflora is dominated by Luekisporites and Parasaccites. Diagnostic elements include Didecitriletes ericianus, Marsupipollenites sinuosus, Dulhunryispora dulhuntyi and occasional Quadrisporites horridus. They identify the Lower Stage 5 microflora of Late Permian age (? Roadian).|

14148|Nimbin Rhyolite|Name source|Nimbin' village; GR 217366, Nimbin 1:50 000 sheet 9540-IV.|
14148|Nimbin Rhyolite|Type section locality|500 m of rhyolite flows and minor pyroclastics from the base on the eastern side of Terania Creek (284400) to the summit of Mt Matheson (294428). |
14148|Nimbin Rhyolite|Extent|The unit is exposed over 400 km2 of mainly elevated, heavily vegetated areas north-east and east of Nimbin, mainly within the northern half of the Rosebank 1:50 000 sheet 9540-I area.|
14148|Nimbin Rhyolite|Thickness range|Range 50-500 m. Highly variable over short distances.|
14148|Nimbin Rhyolite|Lithology|Two feldspar rhyolites, including aphyric and porphyritic flows and pyroclastics (tuffs and breccias). A glassy selvage up to 10 m thick is preserved at the base of many flows. Very minor rhyodacite. A few basaltic flows intercalated with the rhyolites in the Whian Whian State Forest area.|
14148|Nimbin Rhyolite|Relationships and boundaries|Conformably overlies the Lismore Basalt and is overlain by the Blue Knob Basalt (McElroy 1962). The base is marked by an abrupt change from the subalkaline basaltic rocks of the Lismore Basalt to rhyolitic flows and pyroclastics; the top by an equally abrupt change back to subalkaline basalts comprising the Blue Knob Basalt. Belongs to Lamington Volcanics (Gp).|
14148|Nimbin Rhyolite|Age reasons|No rhyolites from the southern portion of the Tweed Shield Volcano have been dated. Rhyolites from the Binna Burra Rhyolite in the northern portion have been dated at about 21 m.y. and the volcanic sequence as a whole at 23-20 m.y. by K-Ar methods (Wellman and McDougall, 1974).|

14148|Nimbin Rhyolite|Comments|The name 'Nimbin Rhyolite' was originally proposed by McElroy (1962). It is here redefined to exclude the rhyolites west and south of Nimbin, remnants of a single flow and now thought to be stratigraphically lower than the Nimbin Rhyolite.|
14280|North Ridge Basalt|Name source|North Ridge is a locally used name for east-west trending ridge adjacent to north coast of Lord Howe Island, rising to 209 m at Malabar. Not named on map of Lord Howe Island (Department of Lands, Sydney, 1966, 1:15840). Term coined by Standard (1963) as North Ridge volcanics.|
14280|North Ridge Basalt|Unit history|Standard (1963) called these rocks the North Ridge volcanics, and Game (1970) referred to them as the "horizontal altered series".|
14280|North Ridge Basalt|Type section locality|In North Ridge, with typical exposures along north coast of Lord Howe Island over 2 km. Accessible at Old Gulch.|
14280|North Ridge Basalt|Extent|Underlies much of northern one-third of Lord Howe Island, cropping out in North Ridge, extending from Neds Beach to the west coast, in Transit Hill and on Mutton Bird Island, over an area of about 4 km2.|
14280|North Ridge Basalt|Thickness range|200 m +|
14280|North Ridge Basalt|Lithology|Sequence of basalt (tholeiitic) lava flows dipping gently to the northwest in North Ridge. Flows 1 to 10 m thick, averaging 2 to 5 m thick. Fragmental, often oxidized tops and bottoms of flows, with more massive interiors.|
14280|North Ridge Basalt|Relationships and boundaries|Overlies with erosional disconformity the Malabar Tuff Complex. Overlain by much younger Neds Beach Calcarenite and alluvial deposits.|
14280|North Ridge Basalt|Age reasons|K-Ar ages on five samples range from 6.6 +/- 0.2 Ma to 7.2 +/- 0.1 averaging 6.9 +/- 0.2 Ma, and therefore probably Late Miocene. Normal magnetic polarity.|

26082|Nowranie Creek Formation|Type section locality|3.87 m of laminated claystone as found in bore DM Oaklands RDH 17 (GR DA 162748), Urana 1:100 000 sheet, from 175.56 m to 179.43 m. Sharp top and gradational base. Its top is identified by a coarse sandstone and its base grades into carbonaceous material and/or coal.|
26082|Nowranie Creek Formation|Extent|The formation occurs only in the subsurface. Its subcrop extends over about 500 km2 in the central portion of Jerilderie 1:250 000 sheet (SI 55-14) and probably further north.|
26082|Nowranie Creek Formation|Thickness range|Range from a few centimetres to over 7 metres.|
26082|Nowranie Creek Formation|Lithology|Claystone dark grey, carbonaceous and claystone light grey to buff; laminated; minor slumping in upper half; abundant coaly partings; claystone dark grey is predominant. Claystone laminated is generally weathered and iron stained at top. In Oaklands-Coorabin area the formation is represented mainly by a pink clay band underlain by sandstone and/or conglomerate.|
26082|Nowranie Creek Formation|Relationships and boundaries|It unconformably overlies the Loughmore Formation (Palese and Morgan, in prep.). It is unconformably overlain by Tertiary sediments of the Renmark Beds (Harris, 1966) to the south and by Triassic sediments to the north. The nature of the contact is not known.|

24434|Noyeau Hollow Andesite|Thickness range|1500 to 3000 m.|
24434|Noyeau Hollow Andesite|Lithology|The formation consists mainly of aphanitic and porphyritic lavas, both equally abundant. They vary from light to dark grey to greenish grey in colour, weathering to purplish brown. Plagioclase phenocrysts (20-50%) (1-4 mm) are most common in the porphyritic types. Pyroxene phenocrysts also present. Vesicles are present mainly in the aphanitic types. The groundmass for both types consists of opaques and altered microlaths of plagioclase and chlorite.|
24434|Noyeau Hollow Andesite|Relationships and boundaries|The Noyeau Hollow Andesite with the underlying Rothery Tuff comprise the Walli Sub Group. The Cliefden Caves Limestone of Middle to Late Ordovician age conformably overlies the Noyeau Hollow Andesite.|

24437|Ondyong Point Formation|Name source|Ondyong Point, a small spur at the end of Lake George (GR 206/205).|
24437|Ondyong Point Formation|Unit history|None.|
24437|Ondyong Point Formation|Type section locality|A fully cored type section is unavailable as recovery from the unit was poor.  Representative sections are designated from the best recovered intervals of core from the BMR drillholes C251 (36.0-48.2m), C352 (42.5-48.0m), C353 (58.0-71.0m) and C358 (40.0-59.0m). Over other intervals partially weathered sand, silt and clay have been cored with recovery levels mostly in excess of 90%.|
24437|Ondyong Point Formation|Extent|Lake George drainage basin (Canberra 1:100 000 sheet 8727).  The formation is only known in the subsurface. It may extent laterally beneath alluvial plains marginal to the lake.|
24437|Ondyong Point Formation|Thickness range|A maximum known thickness of 53m in BMR drillhope C354 and minimum of 10m on C360.|
24437|Ondyong Point Formation|Lithology|Horizontally bedded sand, silt and clay. Sandy units near the base maybe coarse-grained and graded.  Towards the top of the unit it is dominated by mottled and laminated clay. Reddish-brown ferrigineous weathering profiles occur intermittently throughout the unit. Gamma and neutron logs record lithological constraints (Abell, 1985a). The relative distribution of clay and non-clay minerals is given in Abell (1985b).|
24437|Ondyong Point Formation|Depositional environment|Transitional fluvio-lacustrine sequence.|
24437|Ondyong Point Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The base of formation is arbitrarily placed at the top of the deep weathering profile in the Gearys Gap Formation - this boundary may represent a disconformity.  The formation is conformably overlain by the Bungendore Formation: the upper boundary is taken at the highest and most persistent sand bed at the top of the formation which is readily picked from gamma and neutron logs.  The unit grades laterally into alluvial sediments at the northen, eastern and southern margins of the Lake George basin. It is truncated by the Lake George Fault.|
24437|Ondyong Point Formation|Age reasons|A pollen assemblage in carboneous clays gives a preliminary age of Late Miocene (Truswell, 1984).|
24437|Ondyong Point Formation|Correlations|Based on pollens the formation may at least be the same age as the Triporopollenites bellus zone of the Gippsland Basin and perhaps rainforest-dominated intervals in the Lachlan River valley (Truswell, 1984).|

The initial part of the section along Mihi Creek was measured to locality 297-6 at 30038?13?S 150019?13?E (0243174E 6607545N Willuri 1:25 000 sheet). Because of lack of further outcrop, the section was linked southwards with locality 297-12 at 30038?57?S,150018?59?E (ignimbrite bed c, 02428160E 6606196N Willuri 1:25 000 sheet) by traverse; cliffs prevent ready access to ignimbrite bed b east of Haystack Rock (0243340E 6604800N Willuri 1:25 000 sheet).|
40758|Piney Range Member|Extent|The Piney Range Member contains three beds of purple ignimbrite, a, b and c. The base of the member is taken at the base of ignimbrite bed a and the top either at the upper surface of ignimbrite bed c or, where that bed is absent, the top of ignimbrite bed b. The member crops out adjacent to the Plagyan Thrust and extends from the southern part of Nioka to 2 km west of Arizona. It extends westwards into the region adjacent to Dripping Rock and Mallee. Beds a and possibly b crop out on the northeastern margin of Tulcumba Ridge; ?bed b extends southwards to a tributary of Rangira Creek. Additional outcrops tentatively referred to bed a may be present at Connors Creek beneath the Bideroi Ignimbrite Member. Beds a and b are present throughout the greater part of the member. Bed c is restricted to the eastern margin of an amphitheatre south of Mihi Creek and to a small area south and southwest of Dripping Rock.|
40758|Piney Range Member|Thickness range|The member ranges in thickness from a maximum of about 400 m in section 297, in which all three ignimbrite beds are present, to about 230 m in section 406 at Mallee south. The range of thickness of the ignimbrite beds is: a 10-20 m; b 20-35 m; and c 12 m.|
40758|Piney Range Member|Lithology|Ignimbrite beds a-c are purple to grey, slightly welded to unwelded, with scattered phenocrysts of plagioclase, minor K-feldspar, quartz, ? biotite and opaque minerals. Pumice fragments are rare. Shards are oriented, thick and accompanied by slightly distorted bubbles. Groundmass is micropoikilitic or spherulitic. In the region between Mallee and Dripping rock, ignimbrite bed b is more strongly welded and has more abundant quartz.

15968|Redan Gneiss|Name source|Used informally by Rayner (1949). Redan Homestead occurs about 1 km east of the area occupied by the Redan Gneiss.|
15968|Redan Gneiss|Unit history|Rayner (1949) used the term "Redan gneiss" to encompass a very large area of rock in the southeastern part of the Broken Hill Block, but did not formally define the term. His Redan Gneiss is more or less equivalent to Redan Gneiss, Ednas Gneiss and Mulculca Formation as defined here. Corbett's (1981) "Redan rock unit association" incorporates Redan Gneiss as defined here, but also includes much of Ednas Gneiss and some of Mulculca Formation.|
15968|Redan Gneiss|Type section locality|The type area extends from 1 to 7 km west of Redan Homestead (grid squares 5836, 6036 and 6236, Redan 1:25 000 sheet). A type section is nominated in this area, from GR 6150 3600 to GR 6240 3900 (top). The base of the Redan Gneiss is not exposed. A reference section is nominated between GR 5700 3300 and GR 5100 3300 (Redan 1:25 000 sheet), to provide additional lithological information.|
15968|Redan Gneiss|Description at type locality|The Redan Gneiss consist essentially of two types of mapped rock unit. The more distinctive type of unit consists mainly of albite-quartz-hornblende-magnetite (+/- K-feldspar, clinopyroxene) rock (afm) (Fig. 4). The afm rocks (described by Corbett 1981, and Stroud et al. 1983 p.248-252) are typically medium grained and have well-defined lamination consisting of thin (1-4 mm) hornblende-rich and quartz+feldspar layers (5-20 mm). The rocks consist of albite and quartz with various proportions of hornblende, clinopyroxene, K-feldspar, and iron/titanium oxides. Epidote occurs replacing clinopyroxene, and minor scapolite, apatite and zircon have been identified. These rocks have chemical and textural similarities to the sodic plagioclase-quartz rocks abundant elsewhere in the Broken Hill Block (Brown et al. 1983). The other abundant type of rock unit in the Redan Gneiss consists mostly of albite-quartz-magnetite rock (P1 (Fig. 5). The rock is medium to fine grained and commonly exhibits layering defined by variation in magnetite content. These rocks consist mostly of albite and quartz, with sporadic K-feldspar and about 2-7% magnetite (Corbett 1981). They are a magnetite bearing variety of the sodic plagioclase-quartz rocks abundant elsewhere. The Redan Gneiss contains very few outcrops of amphibolite, and no quartz-magnetite rocks have been observed. There are also no ourcrops of sillimanite bearing or micaceous metasediments, although the large areas of non-outcrop could contain some of these.|
15968|Redan Gneiss|Extent|The Redan Gneiss is confined to the Redan 1:25 000 sheet, and extends southwestwards for about 15 km from Redan Creek, near the Redan Homestead. It occupies the core of the Redan Antiform.|
15968|Redan Gneiss|Thickness range|Difficult to determine due to lack of information on internal folding, but estimated at 1.5 km (base no exposed).|
15968|Redan Gneiss|Relationships and boundaries|The base is not exposed. The upper boundary with Ednas Gneiss is taken where the abundant afm rocks of the Redan Gneiss give way to abundant sodic plagioclase-quartz-magnetite gneiss (BT) of Ednas Gneiss. The northwestern boundary corresponds with the margin of a strong linear magnetic anomaly in the basal part of Ednas Gneiss.|

16079|Rickabys Creek Gravel|Extent|Occurs as a subsurface gravel sheet between Cranebrook and Windsor, exposed where dissected by Rickabys Creek. Also as outliers on the Blue Mountains Plateau.|
16079|Rickabys Creek Gravel|Thickness range|Range 2-12 m.|
16079|Rickabys Creek Gravel|Lithology|Polymictic gravel, sporadic crossbedded sand lenses. High matrix content of unconsolidated silt, sand and clay.|
16079|Rickabys Creek Gravel|Relationships and boundaries|Erosional into and hence disconformable on both the Wianamatta Group in the Cumberland Basin, and on the Hawkesbury Sandstone on the Blue Mountains Plateau. Gradually fines up into the overlying Londonderry Clay.|
16079|Rickabys Creek Gravel|Age reasons|No floral or faunal assemblages are available for dating. Silcrete boulders found within the gravel suggest that the formation was deposited subsequent to a period of duricrust formation. Londonderry Clay Overlying the Rickabys Creek Gravel has been lateritised suggesting that the gravel was deposited between two periods of duricrust formation. It is suggested (Gobert in press) that the widespread lateritisation of the Londonderry Clay is of latest Miocene or early Pliocene age while the formation of silcrete took place during or prior to the mid Oligocene. On this evidence a Miocene age for the deposition of Rickabys Creek Gravel is suggested.|

Silcrete and laterite pebbles found in the formation suggest that the formation was deposited after a period of duricrusting of probable mid-Oligocene age. The formation also appears to have undergone lateritisation, probably during the Late Miocene/Early Pliocene. A Late Oligocene-Early Miocene age is hence suggested (Gobert in press).|

Formation comprises about 60 m of non-calcareous sandy shale and dark grey shale with beds of fine-grained sandstone.  Upper and lower boundary relationship not exposed (this locality is now party obscured by a retaining wall and shrubs). REFERENCE LOCALITY: Cutting in northeastern part of State Circle between Commonwealth Avenue and Kings Avenue (Lat 35o 18'S Long 149o 07'E). Here the formation consists of buff-coloured laminated siltstone and shale with fine sandstone beds contorted by slumping. The age of the sequence is late Llandovery as indicated by the graptolite Monograptus exiguus (Strusz and Jenkins 1982).  The upper boundary at this locality is unconformably overlain by the Camp Hill sandstone member, the basal unit of the Canberra Formation.|

26154|Sutton Granodiorite|Name source|The village of Sutton, NSW at GR 051/063.|
26154|Sutton Granodiorite|Unit history|Sutton Granite and Greenwood Granite (Joplin and others, 1953, Moore, 1957 and Stauffer and others, 1964); Bywong Granite (Moore, 1957)  and Sutton Group (Strusz, 1971).|
26154|Sutton Granodiorite|Type section locality|Slopes west of Bywong Hill where the unit is represented by tors and pavements of mildly deformed coarse biotite-rich granodiorite (Canberra 1:100 000 sheet 8727).|
26154|Sutton Granodiorite|Extent|As elongated stocks roughly parallel to meridional trending Ordovician sediments.  The northerly intrusion (10km2) form the western half of a small range culminating in Bywong Hill (GR 079/083).  To the southwest a smaller intrusion of 4km2 is poorly exposed in elevated wooded terrain west of Greenwood Hill (GR 040/989).  The subsurface extent maybe inferred from hornfelsed and spotted sediments in a surrounding contact metamorphic aureole.|
26154|Sutton Granodiorite|General description|Pale grey granodiorite with small and sparsely distributed hornblende-rich xenoliths. The intrusions are cut by quartz reefs and occasional aplite veins. Specimens typically contain quartz, zoned plagioclase, perthitic potash feldspar, biotite, accessory zircon, apatite and allanite. Two magnetic anomalies (BMR 1978) indicate these intrusions are relatively rich in magnetite. Poorly exposed outcrops of leucocratic adamellite and felsic porphyry maybe a fractionated sequence cogenetic with the granodiorite.|
26154|Sutton Granodiorite|Age reasons|Intrudes and hornfelses Late Ordovician Pittman Formation. Upper age limit constrained by an East-West trending dolerite dyke of presumed Early Devonian age which cuts a marginal intrusion south of Oakdale Homestead (GR 093/109). A latest Silurian age is indicated by a Rb-Sr date of 410+/-4Ma.  Presence of allanite and hornblende-rich xenoliths suggest the Sutton Granodiorite is probably an I-type intrusion and probably the same age as similar I-type intrusions south of Queanbeyan, eg., Barracks Creek Adamellite and Googong Adamellite.|

24511|Tallaganda Granodiorite|Lithology|Foliated, quartz-rich granodiorite with about 10% mafic minerals (recrystallised biotite, epidote, allanite, sphene and opaques).|
24511|Tallaganda Granodiorite|Age reasons|Probably early Devonian as it is intruded by dolerite dykes similar to late Devonian dolerites further east, however both the granodiorite and dolerites have been deformed in the Carboniferous Kanimblan Fold episode.|

26327|Taplow Limestone Member|Identifying features|Informally named the 'upper coral' unit (Webby 1969), the Taplow Limestone Member of the Fossil Hill Limestone has its type section on Dunhill Bluff (GR 753814*) immediately to the north-east of Fossil Hill. It is 10 m thick. The name derives from Taplow Flat (GR 738815), 1.2 km west of the type locality. A 1 m-thick unit of grey, massive-bedded skeletal wackestones and packstones with large colonies of Tetradium cribriforme defines the base of the Taplow Limestone Member on Dunhill Bluff.  The directly underlying beds are thin, nodular, skeletal wackestones and calcareous siltstones of the Wyoming Limestone Member. A similar sharp contact with the underlying Wyoming Limestone Member exists in the Fossil Hill section. Massively bedded skeletal packstones and grainstones form the lower part, and thinner bedded skeletal wackestones, lime mudstones and minor interbedded shales the upper part of the Taplow Limestone Member. The transition into the overlying Dunhill bluff limestone Member is gradational with the boundary placed on the top of the last 0.12 m thick 'platy' limestone bed. Succeeeding beds of the Dunhill Bluff Limestone Member are thinner, more prominently nodular, and have more conspicuous shaly partings. The Taplow Limestone Member has been mapped as a persistent and recognizable unit throughout the Cliefden Caves area. (*Canowindra 1:50 000 sheet 8630 I & IV, edit 1 (1978).|

27303|Transmission Limestone Member|Identifying features|Previously an 'upper big shell' unit and an overlying 'lithic' unit were differentiated (Webby 1969). However, it seems preferable to include the 2-3 m thick lithic sandstone, which outcrops very discontinuously throughout the area as the topmost part of the Transmission Limestone Member. The Transmission Limestone Member represents the topmost of the six constituent members of the Fossil Hill Limestone. The type section is taken at the top of the ridge on Dunhill Bluff (GR 753814*) not on the west facing slope of the bluff where the succession is cut by a fault. The name derives from Transmission Flat (GR 762823*) 1.2 km north-east of the type locality. All the beds except the topmost lithic sandstone appear to be exposed in the type section. They are some 21 m thick. The lithic sandstone is perhaps best exposed at the west side of Davys Creek (GR 744811). A 5 m thick sequence of massive  bedded, dark grey lime mudstones, wackestones and fine grainstones define the base of the member. The next 7 m of succession is more thin bedded - with fawn brown skeletal wackestones and including a 3 m thick Eodinobolus shell bank. A 1 m-thick nautiloid-rich bed of skeletal packstone and grainstone forms the base of the next, massively bedded 9 m-thick sequence, the upper part of which is more predominantly lime mudstone and wackestone. The nature of contact with the overlying lithic sandstone is not exposed in the type section, but is elsewhere, for example on west side of Davys Creek. The Transmission Limestone Member has been mapped as an independent and persistent unit throughout the Cliefden Caves area.  (*Canowindra 1:50 000 sheet 8630 I & IV, edit 1 (1978)).|

24537|Trilobite Hill Limestone Member|Identifying features|The Trilobite Hill Limestone Member was previously known informally as the 'Island' unit (Webby 1969). It is the lower of the two constituent members of the Vandon Limestone, and derives its name from Trilobite Hill (GR 737809*), the type section. The lower limit of the Trilobite Hill Limestone Member in the type section is defined at the change to more thinly-bedded lime mudstones and skeletal wackestone beds less than 0.1 m thick. Of the 22 m total thickness, the lower 5.5 m comprises grey, thin bedded wackestones and lime mudstones, the middle 10.5 m, fawn brown skeletal wackestones and packstones with shaly interbeds and abundant fossils, and the upper 6 m, well bedded wackestones. The top is defined by the appearance of the massive, grey lime mudstones of the Mount Lewin Limestone Member, in the Trilobite Hill section only 1.5 m thick. The Trilobite Hill Limestone Member has been mapped as an independent unit throughout the Cliefden Caves area and at Licking Hole Creek (Percival 1976).

27247|Urialla Granite|Description at type locality|Fine to medium-grained biotite is the main phase developed with coarse porphyritic variaties developed particularly along the western margin. Xenoliths up to 22 cm long are found along the margins of the body in the porphyry and reveal varying stages of absorption by the porphyry. The biotite granite typically contains microcline, quartz, oligoclase and biotite. A minor granodioritic phase contains plagioclase (oligoclase-andesine) quartz, biotite and opaques ranging in grain size between 0.5 and 3 mm, in a dominantly feldspar groundmass. The bulk of the granite appears to have no foliation developed and it is only in the marginal porphyritic phases that a groundmass foliation is developed.|
27247|Urialla Granite|Extent|The granite lies to the east of Burra Road, extending south from the Queanbeyan River. The mass is elongated meridionally over a distance of some 11 km and lies roughly parallel to the Watch Box Granite to the east.  Size: 17 km2; 2.5 km wide by 11 km long.|
27247|Urialla Granite|Relationships and boundaries|The southern and northern boundaries are indistinct and the present ground surface would seem to be coincident with the roof of the granite in these parts. Contact metamorphism is evident with sediments raised to the biotite zone on the western contact (a width of 1.5 km) and a metaquartzite developed on the eastern margin. Ordovidian sediments (Foxlow Beds) completely surround the granite, separating it from the Watch Box Granite to the east by a minimum distance of 180 m.|

27304|Vandon Limestone|Comments|The informal 'Upper Member' of Webby (1969) was named the Large Flat Limestone Member by Osborne (1978): this latter is now defined as a new formation, the Vandon Limestone. The name 'Large Flat' has been used previously to describe the upper part of the Lower Member of the Cliefden Caves Limestone (see Hill, 1957, p.100), i.e. as revised in the upper part of the Fossil Hill Limestone. The Vandon Limestone is the upper of the three constituent formations of the Cliefden Caves Limestone Group. The name derives from the 'Vandon' property, on which the most complete sections of beds (on the slopes below Malongulli Sugarloaf) are found. The type section was not designated by Osborne (1978). It will be designated in the forthcoming publication as composite, including the section on Trilobite Hill (GR 737809*) for the lower part, and the section on the upper reaches of Copper Mine Creek, 550 m east-south-east of Malongulli Sugarloaf (GR 725797*) for the upper part. In the composite type section a total of 51 m of Vandon Limestone is recognised.  (*Canowindra 1:50 000 sheet 8630 I & IV, edit 1 (1978)).|

24570|Wheeo Basalt|Age reasons|Miocene on basis of four K-Ar age determinations by ;I. McDougall: range 14.4 to 19.4 m.y. Uncertainties about loss of radiogenic argon due to alteration of the basalt suggest that the true age may be closest to the oldest age determined (19.4 m.y. - I.

20121|Willowie Creek beds|Lithology|Tuffaceous mudstones, fine-grained intermediate to mafic igneous rocks and less abundant greywackes, argillites, breccias, conglomerates, jaspers, cherts and deformed gabbroic and dioritic rock types.|
20121|Willowie Creek beds|Relationships and boundaries|Unconformably overlain by the Mesozoic Clarence-Moreton Basin and intruded by a number of coarse-grained intermediate to silicic plutonic bodies. It is in fault contact with the Baryulgil Serpentinite, part of the Coombadjha Volcanic and Gundahl Complex.|
20121|Willowie Creek beds|Age reasons|Corals poorly preserved in limestone to the northeast of Jackadgery were considered by Fletcher (in Whiting, 1954) to be Silurian but may be Devonian (Runnegar in Korsch, 1977). The age is probably Siluro-Devonian (see Korsch, 1977; Day et al., 1978).|

39257|Willuri Formation|Type section locality|Section 297 Mihi Creek-Piney Range measured along Mihi Creek from the Plagyan Thrust 30o37'58"S 150o19'50"E (0244153E 6608055N) to an amphitheatre; thence from Haystack Rock to the end of outcrop at 30o39'21"S 150o18'16"E (0241700E 6605429N Willuri 1:25,000 sheet). The upper part of the formation, absent from the type section because of lack of outcrop, is best displayed in section 405 from unnamed ignimbrite Cw7 at 0238934E 6608122N on Bunaleer to the end of outcrop at 0237489E 6608203N (Willuri 1:25,000 sheet) on Lyndhurst (Roberts et al. ms).|
39257|Willuri Formation|Extent|Carroll-Nandewar block between Carroll and Cenozoic basalts of the southern Nandewar Range; possibly in the Clifton-Carroll block west of the Werrie Syncline.|
39257|Willuri Formation|Thickness range|1565 m in the type section. Thicker sections adjacent to the type section are 298 Piney Range 1830 m, and 410-436 Bunaleer-Dripping Rock 1780 m; on Tulcumba Ridge 1920 m thick in section 578 Kelvin State Forest-Surrey (Roberts et al. ms). Thinner sections are present adjacent to the southern Nandewar Range and on Gunnan Ridge, the latter being incomplete because of faulting.|
39257|Willuri Formation|Lithology|Coarse to medium grained, medium to very thickly bedded, rarely cross bedded, pink, beige, brown, orange, green or grey volcanolithic sandstone, and pebbly sandstone; conglomerate containing predominantly volcanic clasts ranging in size from granules to boulders, commonly pebbles to cobbles; thinly bedded, laminated to occasionally contorted grey, brown, beige, red or purple siltstone and tuffaceous siltstone;  fine to coarse purple to pink tuff with angular to rounded volcanic clasts; volcanic breccia; and interbedded ignimbrites, lavas and one, possibly two domes. The range of variation within the volcanic units is outlined in this paper. The composition of the volcanic rocks range from rare andesite through mafic dacite to felsic dacite and rhyolite.|
39257|Willuri Formation|Depositional environment|Alluvial to fluvial environment on the flanks of or in close proximity to volcanic sources. Conglomerates and conglomeratic sandstones were largely derived from nearby volcanic sources; granitic clasts, presumably derived from the Lachlan Craton to the west, are also present. The conglomerates differ from those in the Werrie region in that they do not appear to infill large palaeovalleys, the erosion of which removed substantial proportions of the pyroclastic flows of that region (McPhie 1983; 1987). No evidence of glaciation was observed in the Willuri Formation in the Carroll-Nandewar block. Analysis of the interbedded and intertonguing packages of volcanics suggest that during an interval of more than 12 Ma in the Namurian to Westphalian there were at least two volcanic centres between the southern Nandewar Range and the region west of the Werrie Syncline.|
39257|Willuri Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Indeterminable: both the lower and upper parts of the formation are bounded by faults.|
39257|Willuri Formation|Age reasons|Late Carboniferous (Namurian to Westphalian), with possible extension into the Early Permian. Lavas which disconformably overlie the Carboniferous succession could either be part of the Willuri Formation or the Boggabri Volcanics.|
39257|Willuri Formation|Correlations|Equivalent to the Currabubula Formation, Rocky Creek Conglomerate, Lark Hill Formation and possibly the upper part of the Clifden Formation in the Darthula block north of the Nandewar Range (Roberts et al. in press). Early Permian rhyodacite and dacite flows which appear to disconformably overlie the Carboniferous succession on Tulcumba Ridge could be partially equivalent to the Boggabri Volcanics.|

27097|Woolomin Group|Name source|The name is derived from Woolomin township (Woolomin 1:25 000 topographic mapsheet 9135-111-N GR 238351).|
27097|Woolomin Group|Unit history|Woolomin Series, Benson 1911; Woolomin Group, Spry 1953, Voisey 1959; Woolomin Beds, Crook 1961. Revision: Woolomin Beds (Crook 1961) are herein revised to Woolomin Group. Detailed mapping of the Woolomin beds has allowed the recognition of two constituent formations and it is therefore appropriate (ASNC notes 9 & 10, article 3H, Staines 1985) that this unit be formalised and assigned group status. Detailed mapping also allows for recognition of the previously undetermined eastern limit of the Woolomin Group where it is in thrust fault contact with Cara Formation (Blake and Murchey fig. 3, this issue).|
27097|Woolomin Group|Constituents|Nangahrah Formation, Bobs Creek Formation, undifferentiated in other areas.|
27097|Woolomin Group|Type section locality|Nundle to Woolomin road near Anderson Flat south of Tamworth (Crook 1961). Reference areas are proposed along the Barraba to Bundarra road (Cobbadah 1:100 000 topographic map sheet 9037 GR 833360 to GR 880500) and in the type areas of the constituent formations.|
27097|Woolomin Group|Extent|Outcrops in an elongate belt approximately 10 km wide and 300 km long immediately east of the Peel Fault System.|
27097|Woolomin Group|Thickness range|Indeterminate due to deformation and poor exposure.|

27097|Woolomin Group|Comments|Discussion: Benson (1911, 1913) introduced the term Woolomin Series to apply to "jaspers, altered spilitic rocks, schistose tuffs, slates, phyllites and hornstones" which crop out east of the Peel Fault. Notably he did not set an eastern limit to the series. Spry (1953), following recommendations of the then current code of stratigraphic nomenclature (Raggatt 1950) assigned the lithological term Group. Voisey (1959) subsequently used the name Woolomin Group for these rocks in the Manilla District. Crook (1961) revised the name to Woolomin Beds applying it to the rocks mapped as Woolomin Series by Benson (1911, 1913, 1914 and others) as far east as Bundarra Suite granitoids but did not feel that the name was appropriate further east (eg., Spry 1953) until stratigraphic continuity could be demonstrated. Leitch and Cawood (1980) subdivided Woolomin Group into two undefined units. They subdivided Woolomin Beds (sensu Crook 1961) introducing, but not defining Wisemans Arm Formation, as a new unit and applying the name Woolomin to an undefined but restricted formation. In a similar manner Cawood (1982) introduces, without definition, Cockburn Formation and, again without definition, uses the name Woolomin Formation for a more restricted formation. These new applications of the name Woolomin are clearly inappropriate for two reasons: the usage is undefined and ISSC (Hedberg 1976) and ASNC (Staines 1985) clearly state that "when a unit is divided into two or more units, the original name should not be employed for any of the subdivisions".  Metamorphism: Prehnite-pumpellyite facies.|

In the type section the base of the formation is taken at a transition from coarse-grained zeolitic lithic sandstone (Isismurra Formation) to fine grained lithic sandstone and fossiliferous siltstone. In the east, the boundary is taken at the transition from massive coarse-grained lithic sandstone (Waverley Formation) to thinly bedded sandstone, calcarenite and siltstone. The upper boundary is marked by a change to massive pink zeolitic sandstone and ignimbrites of the Isismurra Formation.|

26334|Wyoming Limestone Member|Identifying features|Definition: Previously known as the 'brachiopod' unit (Webby 1969), the Wyoming Limestone Member of the Fossil Hill Limestone also has its type section on Fossil Hill (GR 751812*) where it is 27 m thick. The name derives from the property of Wyoming (GR 774770*). The type section on Fossil Hill is well exposed and uncomplicated except for an interval between 5 and 6 m above the base which is intersected by small faults. No large repetition or loss of beds is however apparent. The base is defined at a marked lithological change - grey brown skeletal wackestones with abundant corals assigned to the top of Kalimna Limestone Member and succeeding greenish brown, volcaniclastic fine sandstones to the basal Wyoming Limestone Member. The Wyoming Limestone Member is characterised by its several volcaniclastic influxes and a rich and varied brachiopod fauna. The lithologies of the member include skeletal wackestones, packstones and volcaniclastic, calcareous sandstones. The upper part of the sequence in the type section includes a prominent 4 m thick Eodinobolus shell bank. The transition into the overlying Taplow Limestone Member - into more massively-bedded, grey, skeletal packstones and grainstones with colonies of Tetradium cribriforme - is relatively sharp. The Wyoming Limestone Member has been mapped as an independent unit throughout the Cliefden Caves area.  (*Canowindra 1:50 000 Sheet 8630 I & IV, edit 1 (1978)).|

40760|Yarrari Pyroclastic Member|Type section locality|Locality 403-1 at 30045?14?S,150018?12?E (0241863E 6594567N Kelvin 1:25 000 sheet) at the western margin of Tulcumba Ridge 1.2 km east-northeast of Yarrarai.|
40760|Yarrari Pyroclastic Member|Extent|Extends along the western edge of the mid-part of Tulcumba Ridge. Discontinuous exposures at the western margins of outcrop between Lyndhurst and Bollol Creek (Figure 3).|
40760|Yarrari Pyroclastic Member|Thickness range|50 m at the type locality. Varies between 20 m in section 578 (Figure 6), south of the type locality, to 60 m near the top of section 410 (Figure 5) south of Bunaleer.|
40760|Yarrari Pyroclastic Member|Lithology|The basal unit is a coarse, red, crystal-rich pyroclastic with phenocrysts of quartz, plagioclase, K-feldspar, and biotite as well as rounded pebbles of ignimbrite, rhyolite lava, common pumice fragments, coarse shards and bubbles. The groundmass is glassy, chloritic or pumiceous. This portion of the member may be resedimented. The upper unit is a coarse, grey to beige, crystal-rich, pyroclastic, containing the same mineral constituents, smaller pumice fragments and ignimbrite and ferruginised perlite pebbles; the groundmass is shard-rich and spherulitic to micropoikilitic. XRF analyses by Liang (1989 MU47002) and from samples 492-5 and 492-6 (Table 2 Appendix 3) indicate a dacitic composition|
40760|Yarrari Pyroclastic Member|Age reasons|Zircons from sample 403-1 (Figure 11b) dated by SHRIMP (AS3) group into two ages; 14 grains give an age of 306.8?3.7 Ma and 11 grains an age of 294.0?3.9 Ma. The older age is preferred because of radiogenic Pb loss. In sample 429-1 (Figure 11a) the probability density plot for the 30 analyses of zircons is not a simple bell shaped curve but appears to be formed by two closely spaced age peaks. The overall weighted mean 206Pb/238U age for 29 of the 30 analyses has an MSWD factor of 2.0, giving 307.8 ? 3.7 Ma. However, using the mixture modelling routine of Sambridge and Compston (as available in the ISOPLOT Excel Macro; Ludwig 2003), there appears to be a more dominant peak or grouping at 312.5 ? 3.6 Ma (17 analyses) and a younger subordinate group at 301.6 ? 3.7 Ma. The slightly older group may reflect a primary magmatic age, whilst the younger group may result from small amounts of radiogenic Pb loss. Since ignimbrite bed b of the Carramundra Member (309.6?4.3 Ma) underlies the Yarrarai Ignimbrite Member in the region adjacent to Bunaleer, the mean age of 307.8?3.7 Ma for sample 429-6 (Figure 11a) is preferred to that derived by mixture modelling. The age of both dated samples is taken as Late Westphalian.|
