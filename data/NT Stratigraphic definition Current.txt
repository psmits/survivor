21096|Abarungkwa Sandstone|Unit history|Formerly mapped as part of the now abandoned 'Groote Eylandt beds' (Plumb and Roberts, 1965, 1992).|
21096|Abarungkwa Sandstone|Geomorphic expression|Rugged, bare rocky ridges and coastal cliffs.|
21096|Abarungkwa Sandstone|Type section locality|Lower boundary stratotype: Southern shoreline of North Bay on Bickerton Island (lat. 13o 45'S, long. 136o 10'E; GR PE260790); approximately 12 m of section exposed. Upper boundary locality: Covered interval at lat. 13o 46'S, long. 136o 09'E (GR PE250775). Reference locality: Isthmus between North Bay and South Bay on Bickerton Island, between lat. 13o 45' 00"S, long. 136o 10'E and lat. 13o 45' 45"S, long. 136o 10'E (GR PE260790 to PE260780).|
21096|Abarungkwa Sandstone|Extent|Northern half of the Bickerton Island and on Bustard Island, BLUE MUD BAY.|
21096|Abarungkwa Sandstone|Thickness range|Most complete section at reference section locality where it is estimated to be 100-150m thick.|
21096|Abarungkwa Sandstone|Lithology|White, coarse- to very coarse-grained, cross-bedded, pebbly, quartz-rich (lithic at base) sandstone; quartz-rich granule conglomerate; polymict pebble and cobble conglmerate; minor medium-grained quartz sandstone.|
21096|Abarungkwa Sandstone|Depositional environment|High-energy braided fluviatile.|
21096|Abarungkwa Sandstone|Relationships and boundaries|Lies unconformably on Grindall Formation. Locally overlies Erringkarri Rhyolite with erosional contact; overlain by Bickerton Rhyolite in South Bay area. Where Bickerton Rhyolite is absent the present unit is disconformably overlain by valley-fill conglomerate of the Milyakburra Formation. On Bustard Island it is intruded by Bickerton Rhyolite.|
21096|Abarungkwa Sandstone|Age reasons|Probably Orosirian (Palaeoproterozoic). The overlying Bickerton Rhyolite has been dated by SHRIMP single-zircon U-Pb techniques at ~1815 Ma (Pietsch et al. 1994).|
21096|Abarungkwa Sandstone|Correlations|Considered to correlate with the ~1800-1840Ma felsic volcanic suite widespread in northern Australia (Rawlings, 1994).|
71|Acacia Gap Quartzite Member|Name source|First defined by Malone (1962) who called it the Acacia Gap Tongue of the Masson Formation. Now considered to be a member of the Wildman Siltstone (Needham and Stuart-Smith, 1978), and previous name now considered inappropriate.|

168|Aileron Metamorphics|Comments|Reason for Proposed Name:  Distinctive mappable rock-types.|
27692|Albinia Formation|Name source|The name is derived from the Albinia Spring (6673:5195) situated on the Waite Creek in the western part of the Mount Doreen sheet area.|11/APR/12
27692|Albinia Formation|Type section locality|The type section lies in the SW part of the Vaughan Springs Syncline (6825-5280:6836-5283).|11/APR/12
27692|Albinia Formation|Extent|The Albinia Formation crops out in the Vaughan Springs Syncline and in a few poor outcrops on the northern flank of the basin in the Treuer Range.|11/APR/12
27692|Albinia Formation|Thickness range|The thickness of the formation in the type section is about 150 m and is the thickest known section.|11/APR/12
27692|Albinia Formation|Lithology|The formation is poorly exposed because of its high siltstone and shale content. The most characteristic rock type is a dark grey foetid dolomite with stromatolites, and white, grey and black chert.|11/APR/12
27692|Albinia Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The Albinia Formation overlies the Adelaidean Vaughan Springs Quartzite probably disconformably and is unconformably overlain by the Adelaidean Mount Doreen Formation, and possibly by the Naburula Formation and Rinkabeena Shale Formation also unconformably.|11/APR/12
27692|Albinia Formation|Age reasons|The lithology and stratigraphic position of the Albinia Formation indicate that it is probably Adelaidean in age. It is correlated with the Bitter Springs Formation in the Amadeus Basin.|11/APR/12
27692|Albinia Formation|Comments|Reason for proposed name: The formation was originally thought to be part of the Mount Doreen Formation. It is now considered to be a separate unit and genetically unrelated to the Mount Doreen Formation.|11/APR/12
39599|Alcurra Dolerite|Name source|Alcurra Creek, northern South Australia. Alberga 1:250,000 map sheet area|
39599|Alcurra Dolerite|Unit history|Unit equivalent to Alcurra Dyke Swarm (Coates 1963, Edgoose et al 1993, Scrimgeour et al 1999, Young et al 2002, Edgoose et al 2002) and Kulgera Dyke Swarm (Camacho et al 1991). Synonymous with Alcurra dolerite (Close et al 2003).|

39599|Alcurra Dolerite|Extent|Widespread across Musgrave Block as dykes, sills and less commomly bodies|
39599|Alcurra Dolerite|Lithology|Pristine dolerite has an ophitic to sub-ophitic texture, and contains plagioclase, clinopyroxene, olivine, K feldspar, and minor quartz and opaques. In the southwestern Musgrave Block NT the dolerite has largely been recrystallised to metamorphic grades ranging from garnet granulite to garnet amphibolite facies. Amphibolite is fine-grained, dark greenish black, with equigranular hornblende and plagioclase, and locally garnet. Recystallised dykes that have not also been deformed contain kyanite within plagioclase, and garnet coronas around pyroxene, where they are in contact with plagioclase. Partly recrystallised dykes have garnet and secondary clinopyroxene which define the mylonitic fabric and form coronas on ortho- and clinopyroxene. Completely recrystallised dykes contain garnet, clinopyroxene, hornblende, sodic plagioclase, quartz and rutile, with or without scapolite. In greenschist facies, the dolerite has variably recrystallised to assemblages containing actinolite, chlorite and epidote.|
39599|Alcurra Dolerite|Relationships and boundaries|Intrudes gneiss with protolith ages in the range 1600-1540 Ma; crosscuts gneissic fabric resulting from 1200-1160 Ma Musgrave Orogeny. Intrudes Pitjantjatjara Supersuite granite. Intruded by 1071 +/- 5 Ma Angatja Granite in eastern Musgrave Ranges (Scrimgeour et al 1999). Deformed and metamorphosed during the 570-530 Ma Petermann Orogeny.|
39599|Alcurra Dolerite|Age reasons|1080 Ma interpreted age from correlation with mafic rocks of the 1080 Ma Giles Complex and constrained by 1071 +/- 5 Ma age for Angatja Granite which intrudes it. A Rb/Sr age of 1054 +/- 13 Ma was obtained for a dyke in the Kulgera area and a 1090 +/- 32 Ma Sm-Nd age was obtained for a dyke from the same area by Zhao and McCulloch (1993).|
39599|Alcurra Dolerite|Correlations|Stuart Pass Dolerite of the southern Arunta Region, which has a Sm-Nd age of 1076 ? 33 Ma  (Zhao and McCulloch 1993).|

21122|Alyangula Subgroup|Name source|Alyangula community, Groote Eylandt (GR PE 530675), in BLUE MUD BAY.|
21122|Alyangula Subgroup|Unit history|Formerly mapped as part of the now abandoned 'Groote Eylandt beds' (Plumb and Roberts, 1965, 1992).|
21122|Alyangula Subgroup|Constituents|In ascending order Alyinga Sandstone, Bartalumba Basalt and Dalumbu Sandstone on and around Groote Eylandt. The Woodah Sandstone on other islands and on the mainland is also included in the subgroup and is probably a lateral equivalent of the Alyinga Sandstone.|
21122|Alyangula Subgroup|Type section locality|As for each component formation.|
21122|Alyangula Subgroup|Extent|Groote Eylandt and closely associated islands of the Blue Mud Bay (BLUE MUD BAY, PORT LANGDON, CAPE BEATRICE and ROPER RIVER). Minor exposure of Woodah Sandstone on nearby mainland coastal area.|
21122|Alyangula Subgroup|Thickness range|Maximum thickness is developed on Groote Eylandt, where the estimated composite thickness is 1100m.|
21122|Alyangula Subgroup|Lithology|Predominantly sandstone and pebbly sandstone with minor pebble and conglomerate, interbedded with basalt and dolerite (Bartalumba Basalt and thin basaltic unit in Dalumbu Sandstone).|
21122|Alyangula Subgroup|Relationships and boundaries|The Alyinga Sandstone lies disconformably on the Milyema Formation of the Bustard Subgroup. The Woodah Sandstone lies unconformably on the Grindall Formaiton and its intrusivesm and is locally (Bickerton Island) inferred to overlie the Bustard Subgroup (contact not exposed). There is no good exposed stratigraphic top to the subgroup (the youngest rocks of the Dalumbu Sandstone dip beneath the sea). Cretaceous and Cainozoic rocks and sediments lie unconformably over the subgroup in places.|
21122|Alyangula Subgroup|Age reasons|Probably Statherian (Palaeoproterozoic). The Bickerton Rhyolite in the underlying Bustard Subgroup has been dated by SHRIMP single-zircon U-Pb techniques at ~1815 Mz (Pietsch et al. 1994).|

513|Aquarium Formation|Type section locality|Jackson et al (1987) nominated Aquarium Spring, around latitude 17o29'S longitude 137o37'20"E at the headwaters of Settlement Creek in Calvert Hills mapsheet as the reference area. This is herein redefined as the type section, running along Bullet Creek between 780700E 8064400N (base) and 781200E 8066800N (top). The latter serves as the upper boundary stratotype. REFERENCE SECTION: reference section A is along the Little Calvert River near Calvert Hills homestead, between 743200E 8088000N (approximate base) and 743400E 8089600N (top) in Calvert Hills mapsheet. Reference section B is the interval 90-290 m in DDH HO1 in the Robinson Dome (691700E 8150700N, Robinson River mapsheet), which comprises an upper hornfelsed contact with the Settlement Creek Dolerite, but does not penetrate the underlying Wununmantyala Sandstone (Rawlings 2002). Drill core is stored in the NTGS Core Library, Darwin, for viewing.|07/FEB/11
513|Aquarium Formation|Extent|Throughout the Wearyan Shelf in Calvert Hills and Robinson River 1:250 000 sheet areas.|
513|Aquarium Formation|Thickness range|120 (Tawallah Range) and >200 m (Robinson River) (Ahmad and Wygralak 1989, Rawlings 2002)|
513|Aquarium Formation|Lithology|The Aquarium Formation is an upward-fining sequence that incorporates a lower fine-grained sandstone facies and an upper dolomitic mudstone facies. The lower facies is uniformly fine-grained with thick beds of maroon sandstone with diffuse trough and hummocky cross-stratification (HCS) and local mudclasts, synaeresis cracks, linear and interference megaripples, current lineation, flute casts, runzel and tool marks, glauconite and gypsum pseudomorphs (Rawlings 2002). The upper Aquarium facies is composed of dolomitic, glauconitic, micaceous and ferruginous mudstone and fine-grained sandstone, with scattered intervals of dololutite and dolarenite. Common sedimentary structures are cross-lamination and small cross-beds, current lineation, tool marks, flute and runzel marks, load casts and local HCS. However, the upper 15 m is characterised by fine parallel-laminated red/brown (oxic) mudstone that is massive to locally disrupted, with common halite and anhydrite pseudomorphs. Mudstone within 1-10 m of the Settlement Creek Dolerite is hornfelsed and locally brecciated.|
513|Aquarium Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Conformably overlies the Wununmantyala Sandstone in the upper Tawallah Group (Rawlings 2002), the boundary marked by a transition from medium-grained to fine-grained sandstone, associated with a distinctive change in bedforms, from trough to hummocky cross-bedded. The top of the Aquarium Formation is an intrusive (ie non-conformable) contact with the Settlement Creek Dolerite, a regionally-extensive sill or set of sills (Rawlings 2002). Prior to intrusion of the dolerite, the Aquarium Formation was in sedimentological continuum with the Wollogorang Formation.|
513|Aquarium Formation|Age reasons|Constrained only by the underlying basement (>1845 Ma) and overlying Wollogorang Formation (~1730 Ma, Jackson et al 1997). A conformable relationship with the latter suggests its age is closer to 1730-1740 Ma (Rawlings 2002).|
513|Aquarium Formation|Correlations|The Wuraliwuntya Member of the Wununmantyala Sandstone in the Batten Fault Zone in the Bauhinia Downs and Mount Young 1:250 000 map sheets (Pietsch et al 1991, Haines et al 1993). It also tentatively correlates with the Bonanza Creek, lower McCaw, Dhunganda and Yuduyudu Formations in the northern McArthur Basin in the Mount Marumba and Arnhem Bay-Gove 1:250 000 map sheets (Rawlings et al 1997, Sweet et al 1999).|
513|Aquarium Formation|Comments|The need to redefine this formation arose from the insufficient definition provided by Jackson et al (1987) and from the revised stratigraphic framework emanating from recent (1995-2000) NTGS and NABRE studies. The redefinition incorporates a change in the name of the underlying unit, from Sly Creek Sandstone (Roberts et al 1963, Ahmad and Wygralak 1989) to Wununmantyala Sandstone (Rawlings 1999, Jackson et al 2000). The Wununmantyala Sandstone was defined in the Bauhinia Downs 1:250 000 map sheet by Jackson et al (1987) and Pietsch et al (1991) and thought to be restricted to the Batten Fault Zone. Instead, Wununmantyala Sandstone is now mapped underlying the Aquarium Formation throughout the Wearyan Shelf, while the Sly Creek Sandstone appears to be absent (Jackson et al 2000). The redefinition also formalises the change of name for areas mapped as Aquarium Formation by Pietsch et al (1991) and Haines et al (1993) in the Batten Fault Zone to McDermott Formation (Rawlings 1999, Jackson et al 2000).|

524|Aralka Formation|Unit history|The Aralka Formation was originally included in the basal part of the Pertatataka Formation by Wells et al. (1967). The Olympic Formation (formerly Olympic Member of the Pertatatataka Formation) is postulated to be laterally continuous with the Pioneer Sandstone (formerly the upper unit of the Areyonga Formation) and hence it was concluded that the interval between the Olympic and Areyonga Formation in the northeast part of the Amadeus Basin is a previously unrecognised separate formation, older than the Pertatataka Formation and should be formalised.|
524|Aralka Formation|Type section locality|The type section ASR 4 lies 6.4 km southeast of Ringwood Homestead at Longitude 135o02'E latitude 23o53'S, on Alice Springs K17 photos Run 13/Photo 5136. The shale sequences in the formation are mostly obscured but the Ringwood and Limbla Members are well exposed. The type section is - TOP 144 m Limbla Member - festoon cross-laminated sandstone in upper half; pebbly and sandy calcarenite in lower half. 333 m concealed - siltstone and shale sequence with minor sandstone interbeds inferred from partial exposures elsewhere. 166 m Ringwood Member - dolomite and calcarenite, mostly thin bedded, in part pisolitic and stromatolitic. 376 m +/- concealed -siltstone and shale sequence with subordinate sandstone interbeds inferred from partial exposures elsewhere.|
524|Aralka Formation|Extent|The formation is known in outcrop on the Alice Springs, Illogwa Creek, Rodinga, and Hale River 1:250 000 Sheet areas; it is confined to the north-eastern part of the Amadeus Basin.|
524|Aralka Formation|Thickness range|The thickness in the type section is about 1020 m. The formation thickens gradually eastwards but thins rapidly westwards and is not known in outcrop west of about longitude 134o30'E.|
524|Aralka Formation|Lithology|The sequence of rock types in the type section ASR 4 is shown in Wells et al. (1967), Plate 10, and in addition is described in the text of the report.|
524|Aralka Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The formation conformably overlies the Areyonga Formation and is disconformably overlain by the Olympic Formation. The upper boundary is exposed in the type section but the lower boundary is concealed. A stratotype lower boundary is present on the north flank of the Limbla Syncline (longitude 135o17'30" E, latitude 23o47'30"S) where the upper marker cap dolomite of the Areyonga Formation is in contact with shale of the Aralka Formation. A stratotype upper boundary is present in the north west part of the Olympic Syncline (longitude 135o02'30"E 21o01'40"S) where cross laminated sandstone of the Limbla Member is in contact with dark red-brown poorly laminated siltstone and light green-grey, locally gritty, siltstone, of the Olympic Member. A disconformable contact with the Bitter Springs Formation is inferred in areas where the Areyonga Formation is absent.|
524|Aralka Formation|Age reasons|The Aralka Formation lies between formations that are considered to be Adelaidean in age. The Bitter Springs Formation beneath is considered to be no older than about 900 m.y. and shales in the younger Pertatataka Formation have been dated radiometrically at 730 +/- 45 m.y. The Aralka Formation is therefore probably mid-Adelaidean in age.|
571|Areyonga Formation|Name source|Prichard and Quinlan (1962) recognised two members in the Areyonga Formation in its type section. A disconformity has now been recognised separating these members. The upper member is redefined as the Pioneer Sandstone (new name). The name Areyonga Formation is restricted to the lower member, with which it is conveniently associated. The top of the Areyonga Formation in the type section at Ellery Creek is taken as the top of a dark grey silty shale with lenses of regularly laminatead dolomite. The redefined Areyonga Formation is 230 m thick, and consists of diamictite, sandstone, dolomitic arkose, conglomerate and dolomite, with the dolomitic silty shale at the top.|
571|Areyonga Formation|Extent|Locally present in outcrop on the Hermannsburg Henbury 1:250 000 Sheet areas, more widespread on the Illogwa Creek, Hile River and to a lesser extent, Slice Springs and Rodinga 1:250 000 Sheet areas.|

645|Arthur Creek Formation|Name source|Originally defined by K.G. Smith (Progress Report on the Geology of the Huckitta 1:250 000 sheet, Bureau of Mineral Resources Report 67, 1964) as Arthur Creek Beds because of its poor outcrop and a suspected break in the sequence. Following stratigraphic diamond drilling in 1982 and the fact that the break is not evident, it is now desirable to elevate the unit to formation status.|
645|Arthur Creek Formation|Unit history|Now excludes dolomite in Smith's (op. cit.) western outcrops which are assigned to either the Arrinthrunga or Errarra Formations. Probably partly equivalent to the Sandover beds on the Elkedra sheet (north) and the Marqua beds on the Tobermory sheet (east).|
645|Arthur Creek Formation|Type section locality|Holostratotype: in two, overlapping, continuously-cored holes:- DDH. NTGS. HUC2, for upper part, from 20.35 m to 203.76 m depth and DDH. NTGS. HUC 1, for lower part, from 9.17 m to 310.73 m depth. Core will be stored in NTGS core store, Alice Springs. Overlap of the two holes is correlated using the lowest occurrence of limestone beds, a distinctive marker within the formation. Lateral facies variations may result in minor imprecision of this correlation. (HUC 1 is located at latitude 22o31'50"S, longitude 136o15'4"E. HUC 2 at latitude 22o23'7"S, longitude 136o15'4"E).|
645|Arthur Creek Formation|Thickness range|484.97 m in holostratotype. Units as below: Top: 1. In DDH. HUC.2, 20.35-74.73 m (54.38 m) Calcareous quartz arenite.  2. HUC   2, 74.73-203.76 m (129.03 m) laminated calcareous siltstone.  Base: Only the lower subdivision occurs in and west of the Elua Ranges (longitude 136oE) and is thinner (order of 100 m).|
645|Arthur Creek Formation|Lithology|Where fresh, essentially a pyritic, organic-rich, dark grey, laminated, calcareous siltstone with interbeds of limestone and of calcareous quartz arenite. In weathered outcrop a bleached siltstone or, in the west of Huckitta, is replaced by chalcedony. Rarely dolomitic. Most dolomite as recognised by Smith (op. cit) is now assigned to the Arrinthrunga Formation and some to the Errarra Formation. Three recognizable subdivisions as below.|
645|Arthur Creek Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Gradational at top with dolostones of the Arrinthrunga Formation and at the base with sandstone in the Errarra Formation; in both cases over intervals of approx. 1-2 m.|
645|Arthur Creek Formation|Age reasons|Middle Cambrian. Faunas suggest a stage range of Floran or older to late Undillan. (Work proceeding by J.R. Laurie, Bureau of Mineral Resources).|
24166|Atnarpa Igneous Complex|Name source|Atnarpa homestead (GR 5850-783983), situated on tonalite map unit of the Atnarpa Igneous Complex, Fergusson Range 1:100 000 Sheet area.|
24166|Atnarpa Igneous Complex|Type section locality|Reference areas: 1. From GR 5850-77595 for 3 km eastward to 5850-80595 in Fergusson Range 1:100 000; - well exposed hilly terrain of diorite containing rafts of orthoamphibolite of Tommys Gap metamorphics. Western end shows numerous aplite dykes forming separate aplogranite map-unit. 2. At GR 5850-680923 in Fergusson Range 1:100 000; fresh tors of tonalite with abundant dark xenoliths. 3. GR 5850-695930 in Fergusson Range; granite is well exposed on south bank of unnamed creek. 4. GR 5850-970007 in northeast of Fergusson Range; prominent hills of granodiorite on east bank of Hale River.|
24166|Atnarpa Igneous Complex|Extent|Northern part of Fergusson Range 1:100 000 Sheet area and southern part of Riddoch 1:100 000 Sheet area N.T. Forms much of basement core of Arltunga Nappe Complex.|
24166|Atnarpa Igneous Complex|Lithology|Consanquineous igneous complex of diorite-tonalite-granodiorite-granite-aplite-hydrothermal veins (quartz-calcite common). Diorite forms 4 bodies separated by regions of Tommys Gap metamorphics in Giles Creek Synform; is tetrogeneous in mineralogical composition, giving rise to small amounts of such variants as gabbro, tonalite, adamellite, and granite. Tonalite occupies large area in White Range Nappe (central part) and western part of Giles Creek Synform; also mineralogically heterogeneous, forming small amounts of diorite, trandhjemite, granodiorite, adamellite. Retrogressively metamorphosed to mylonitic metatonalite gneiss in root zone of White Range Nappe. Granodiorite map-unit occurs only in Ruby Gap Nappe east of White Range Nappe. Granite forms extensive irregular regions inside tonalite, is coarse and contains roughly equal amounts of albite and microcline. Aplite abundant as dykes and sheets, sufficiently abundant in two areas of the diorite to be mapped as separate areas of aplogranite. Hydrothermal veins mostly intrude the diorite, include quartz-calcite, quartz-calcite-hematite, calcite-epidote.|
24166|Atnarpa Igneous Complex|Relationships and boundaries|Intrudes orthoamphibolite, hornblende gneiss, and basic volcanic units of Tommys Gap metamorphics (q.v.), surrounds rafts of quartz-rich metasediment and amphibolite of Cavenagh metamorphics (q.v.), sends apophyses in large-scale lit-par-lit fashion into biotite gneiss of Hillsoak Bore metamorphics. Adjoins and presumably intrudes hornblende gneiss, biotite gneiss, and quartzofeldspathic gneiss of unnamed unit pCx in Arunta Block. Is intruded by plugs of ultramafic rock, dykes of amphibolite, dykes of dolerite correlated with Stuart Dyke Swarm. Is unconformably overlain by Heavitree Quartzite.|
24166|Atnarpa Igneous Complex|Age reasons|Four out of five whole-rock samples lie on Rb-Sr isochron giving 1710+/-50 m.y. in Giles Creek Synform. Two whole-rock samples lie on Rb-Sr isochron (with several other samples from Cavenagh metamorphics, Cadney metamorphics, Jennings Granitic Gneiss) giving 1719+/-24 m.y.|
24166|Atnarpa Igneous Complex|Comments|Reason for proposed name: Large well-studied well exposed complex of intermediate to acid igneous rocks readily mapped out from adjoining country rocks.|
25768|Attack Creek Formation|Name source|Attack Creek in the Tennant Creek 1:250 000 Sheet area, latitude 19o03'30"S, longitude 134o03'E.|
25768|Attack Creek Formation|Type section locality|Between grid references 401893 and 398892. The section here commences with a basal 80 m of cream-coloured calcareous siltstone, medium to thick bedded. There follows 300 m of dark grey flaggy limestone, in part silicified. Thin calcareous siltstone or shale interbeds (1 cm or less) separate 8-10 cm flags of limestone. Some limestone beds contain shaly clasts, siliceous nodules and oolitic concentrations. The limestone grades into 20 m of concretionary ironstone, calcareous black (manganiferous) mudstone and brown and black mottled chert. This is overlain by 200 m of cream to rusty brown feldspathic quartz sandstone and pink to cream silicified orthoquartzite, followed by a sequence 120 m thick of softer rocks, largely eroded, believed to be friable sandstone or siltstone. The upper part of the formation consists of 100 m of massive, thick-bedded, cream orthoquartzite with 1 to 2 percent of well-rounded, pink orthoquartzite pebbles scattered throughout the sandstone matrix; there are voids left by weathered-out shale clasts.|
25768|Attack Creek Formation|Extent|Crops out in a small area west of the Whittington Range, immediately west of the prominent north-south ridge formed by the Short Range Sandstone.|
25768|Attack Creek Formation|Thickness range|Within the Tennant Creek Sheet area the formation is at least 800 m thick.|
25768|Attack Creek Formation|Lithology|A basal calcareous siltstone overlain by dark grey, partly silicified, flaggy limestone with thin interbeds and shale clasts; the limestone grades into black, calcareous, manganese-rich mudstone and black chert. This is succeeded by feldspathic quartz sandstone and silicified orthoquartzite. The uppermost beds are thick-bedded, cream orthoquartzite with 1 to 2 percent of well-rounded pink orthoquartzite pebbles; they contain voids left by weathered-out shale clasts. The top of the formation is truncated by the present-day erosion surface, and its upper beds have been removed.|
25768|Attack Creek Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Conformable contact with underlying Short Range Sandstone. The formation is situated in the core of a syncline, its upper part is truncated by the present-day erosion surface.|
25768|Attack Creek Formation|Age reasons|By assumed correlation of Tomkinson Creek Beds with Hatches Creek Group, late Early Proterozoic to Early Carpentarian.|
26360|Badalngarrmirri Formation|Name source|From Badalngarrmirri Creek, which drains an area west of the Mitchell Ranges in the eastern Mirrngadja 1:100 000 sheet area.|
26360|Badalngarrmirri Formation|Geomorphic expression|Due to the alternating quartz arenite/mudstone-siltstone stratigraphy, the formation forms a distinctive set of alternating ridges and valleys, each about 100 m to over 1 km across. Collectively, these ridges and valleys extend over 60 km, and form much of the arcuate Parsons Range.|
26360|Badalngarrmirri Formation|Type section locality|In the eastern Parsons Range, a composite section made up of three parts. This replaces the reference area nominated by Plumb & Roberts (1992) (along long. 135o30'E). The lowest part, from the top of the Mattamurta Sandstone at lat. 13o15'51"S, long. 135o31'44"E, extends to the top of informal member 4 (see Comments), at lat. 13o16'52"S, long. 135o32'4"E. The middle part of the section extends from 13o17'2"S, long. 135o29'51"E (base of informal member 5) to 13o18'43"S, long. 135o29'45"E (top of Fairy Glen Sandstone Member). The upper portion of the type section runs from 13o18'37"S, long. 135o30'25"E (base of informal member 11) through to the top of the formation at 13o19'29"S, long. 135o30'32"E.|
26360|Badalngarrmirri Formation|Extent|Main outcrops are in the Parsons Range and southern Mitchell Ranges in the Blue Mud Bay 1:250 000 sheet area, covering around 900 km2. Other outcrops  (1) lie west of the Mitchell Ranges (the Gali Belt, covering around 300 km2), and (2) form a narrow outcrop belt about 1 km wide, along the eastern edge of the Mitchell Ranges, both in the Arnhem Bay 1:250 000 sheet area.|
26360|Badalngarrmirri Formation|Thickness range|2850 m in the composite type section, thinning to the west and southwest, to about 2200 m and to 1900 m, 40 km and 60 km to the southwest, respectively.|
26360|Badalngarrmirri Formation|Lithology|Interbedded medium-grained quartz arenite, ferruginous arenite (presumed to have been glauconitic and pyritic, now mostly weathered to iron oxides), laminated green to grey and black mudstone, wavily laminated and hummocky cross-stratified siltstone and very fine-grained sandstone, and minor stromatolitic dolostone and chert.|
26360|Badalngarrmirri Formation|Depositional environment|Storm-dominated marine shelf, ranging from basinal (below storm-wave base), through lower to upper shoreface and shoreline environments.|
26360|Badalngarrmirri Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Base placed at a prominent photogeological boundary marking the change from strongly cross-bedded quartz arenite of the uppermost Matttamurta Sandstone to olive green mudstone of the Fawcett Member of the Badalngarrmirri Formation. Plumb & Roberts (1992) included an interval of 90 m of ferruginous sandstone in the Badalngarrmirri Formation in the type area, but this has been included in the Mattamurta Sandstone for three reasons: 1. It does not appear to be a laterally continuous unit, but rather due to local secondary iron precipitation; 2. it is indistinguishable from Mattamurta Sandstone in most outcrops; and 3. the main lithological change is above this sandstone - between it and the overlying mudstone and chert. The Mattamurta Sandstone-Badalngarrmirri Formation contact may be an unconformity, at least locally, as at one locality stromatolitic chert encrusts apparently lithified sandstone, and infills cracks up to 0.5 m deep.
The upper contact, with the Marura Siltstone, is conformable, and is placed at the abrupt change from quartz arenite (top of informal member 13) to mudstone; a stromatolitic chert is commonly present a few metres above the contact, within the Marura Siltstone.|
26360|Badalngarrmirri Formation|Age reasons|Palaeoproterozoic: maximum age is well constrained by the age of the uppermost formation of the Donydji Group, the Fagan Volcanics, at 1710 Ma (Pietsch & others, 1994); minimum age is less well constrained, but must be greater than 1620 Ma, the age of the Yarrawirrie Formation in the overlying Balma Group (Pietsch and others, 1994), and is most likely older than 1640 Ma, the age of the Barney Creek Formation (Page & Sweet, in press), a correlative of the central Balma Group below the Yarrawirrie Formation (Haines, 1994).|
26360|Badalngarrmirri Formation|Correlations|No known correlatives, although the Surprise Creek Formation in the Mount Isa Inlier (Derrick and others, 1980) is very similar in its lithology, and stratigraphic and tectonic setting.|
26360|Badalngarrmirri Formation|Proposed publication|Blue Mud Bay Explanatory Notes (Haines and others, 1997).|
26360|Badalngarrmirri Formation|Comments|The Badalngarrmirri Formation has been subdivided into 14 units, reflecting the alternating sandstone-mudstone lithologies. Three of these, the Fawcett Member, Gali Member, and Fairy Glen Sandstone Member, have been formally defined and delineated on the Blue Mud Bay 1:250 000 sheet, whereas the others, which are easily mappable at photoscale (1:50 000) but not easily represented on 1:250 000 maps, are described only in the accompanying publication (Haines and others, 1997).|

21185|Balma Group|Name source|Balma Community on the Blue Mud Bay 1:250 000 scale map area (latitude 13o14'S, longitude 135o51'E).|
21185|Balma Group|Unit history|Formally mapped as McArthur Group by Plumb and Roberts (1965). However, it has no formations in common with the McArthur Group of the southern McArthur Basin (which has priority of usage) and although interpreted to correlate, at least in part, with the McArthur Group, the precise nature of such correlations is speculative. Correlations with the Habgood Group to the north are easier than those with the McArthur Group. This inconsistency is alleviated by establishing a new group.|
21185|Balma Group|Constituents|In ascending order: Koolatong Siltstone, Strawbridge Breccia, Vaughton Siltstone, Conway Formation, Zamia Creek Siltstone, Yarrawirrie Formation, Baiguridji Formation and Bath Range Formation. These units were named by Plumb and Roberts (1965) and defined by Plumb and Roberts (1992).|
21185|Balma Group|Geomorphic expression|Resistant units crop out as low strike ridges. Other units crop out sparsely as low rubbly rises and in creek bank exposures.|
21185|Balma Group|Type section locality|Type sections as for each constituent formation (see Plumb and Roberts, 1992).|
21185|Balma Group|Extent|Largely restricted to the Blue Mud Bay 1:250 000 map sheet area in Arnhem Land, Northern Territory. Minor outcrops occur near the southern edge of the Arnhem Bay 1:250 000 map sheet area.|
21185|Balma Group|Thickness range|Estimated composite thickness of about 4500 m.|
21185|Balma Group|Lithology|Shallow water dolostone, mudstone and sandstone. Minor tuffaceous rocks and limestone.|
21185|Balma Group|Relationships and boundaries|Conformably overlies the Fleming Sandstone of the Parsons Range Group. Overlain by the Balbirini Dolomite of the Nathan Group, but the contact relationship could not be determined due to poor outcrop. Locally intruded by dykes, largely on geophysical evidence.|
21185|Balma Group|Structure and Metamorphism|Most areas (except near major faults) are gently folded with low dip angles. Faulting is common.|
21185|Balma Group|Age reasons|Tuffaceous rocks from the Yarrawirrie Formation and basal Bath Range Formation have given SHRIMP U-Pb zircon ages of 1620+/-21 Ma and 1599+/-11 Ma respectively (Pietsch et al., 1994). These provide maximum ages for the time of sedimentation.|

24175|Bean Tree Granite|Lithology|Granite: fine to medium, leucocratic, porphyritic to even-grained, with biotite, muscovite, quartz (with undulose extinction), partly sericitised plagioclase, alkali feldspar (microcline common +/- perthite), traces of chlorite, zircon and apatite; common alkali feldspar oikocrysts with quartz and partly sericitised plagioclase chadacrysts; granular anhedral texture.|
24175|Bean Tree Granite|Relationships and boundaries|Included in the Barrow Creek Granite Complex. Intrudes Ooralingie Granite (e.g. at AMG GR LS893080 where the Ooralingie Granite occurs as a large xenolith in the Bean Tree Granite) and the Bullion Schist (e.g. at AMG GR LS824006). Intruded by pegmatite (Pgbc).|
24175|Bean Tree Granite|Structure and Metamorphism|Faulted in places.|
24175|Bean Tree Granite|Age reasons|Has been dated by Hurley and others (1961) as 1460 Ma by the K-Ar method and as 1550 Ma by the Rb-Sr method, but this is considered inaccurate and possibly only a minimum age. May be contemporaneous with the Elkedra Granite, which intrudes the Hatches Creek Group and has been dated by the Rb-Sr whole rock method at about 1660 Ma (Blake and others, 1987).|

42492|Benmara Group|Lithology|Mixed sequence of sandstone, mudstone, conglomerate, stromatolitic chert, trachyte and volcaniclastic sandstone.|06/FEB/12
42492|Benmara Group|Relationships and boundaries|Unconformably overlies Murphy Metamorphics and Connellys Volcanics. The contact with the overlying South Nicholson Group is poorly exposed and the relationship cannot be resolved with any certainty. Pinching out of the Benmara Group to the north near 705000E 8007000N is consistent with both an unconformity and a low-angle structural boundary (detachment) dividing the Benmara and South Nicholson Groups. Rawlings et al (in prep) favour a partly reactivated unconformity.|06/FEB/12
42492|Benmara Group|Age reasons|Constrained only by the underlying Murphy Metamorphics and Connellys Volcanics basement (>1845 Ma; Page et al 2000) and probable overlying South Nicholson Group (maximum age ~1500 Ma by correlation with Roper Group; Jackson et al 1999, Abbott et al 2001). Geochronological studies have failed thus far to establish the absolute age of the Buddycurrawa Volcanics, because the trachyte contains too few zircons and is highly weathered. The simplest interpretation is that the Buddycurrawa Volcanics are the same age as the Carrara Range Group and Peters Creek Volcanics (~1725 Ma), which also contain abundant felsic volcanics and shallow intrusives. However, an age closer to 1660-1580 Ma can be implied from their compositional similarity to magmatic rocks in the Coanjula area (Rawlings et al in prep).|06/FEB/12

42492|Benmara Group|Comments|This package of rocks has been accorded group status because its stratigraphic position is better established now and it is unlikely to belong to the South Nicholson Group. In addition, two distinct formations have been recognised within what was previously known as the 'Benmara beds', making group status necessary.

1843|Black Stump Arkose|Type section locality|A composite section compiled from the observation of outcrops in the triangular fault block 0-4 km N by W of Hay River No. 7 (Adam Special 1:100 000 Geological Sheet).|
1843|Black Stump Arkose|Extent|The formation is exposed on the Tobermory, Hay River and Mt Whelan 1:250 000 Sheet areas.|
1843|Black Stump Arkose|Thickness range|An estimated minimum of 700 m in the type area, and a minimum of 500 m on the southern limb of the Desert  Syncline (northern Adam Special 1:100 000 Sheet area). Thicknesses are calculated from aerial photographs; in addition, use was made in calculating the thickness of the type section of a measured section in K.G. Smith's 1959 Hay River notebook. Thicknesses are unknown elsewhere.|
1843|Black Stump Arkose|Lithology|Medium red-brown to dark purple-brown micaceous fine to very coarse-grained arkose, pebbly arkose, sandstone and laminated micaceous siltstone and shale.|
1843|Black Stump Arkose|Relationships and boundaries|The unit disconformably overlies the Yardida Tillite (Walter, 1979). On the southern limb of the Desert Syncline and at Boat Hill (Tobermory 1:250 000 Sheet area) it rests on the dolomitic shale at the top of the tillite. Elsewhere (e.g. Hay River No. 7 drillhole the dolomitic shale has been eroded off and the Arkose overlies diamictite. The upper boundary is placed at the base of the first prominent dolomite bed of the Wonnadinna Dolomite 4.7 km NNE of Gnallan-a-gea Bore (Hay River 1:250 000 Geological Sheet; Adam Special 1:100 000 Geological Sheet). The upper boundary is considered to be gradational as red-brown arkose and dolomitic arkose are components of the Wonnadinna Dolomite.|

36765|Bloods Range Formation|Lithology|Polymict pebble conglomerate (possible debris flows), quartzite-cobble conglomerate, immature sandstone, red and dark fine grained sandstone and siltstone, epiclastic and volcaniclastic rocks, rare tuffs. Thickness and presence/absence of these lithologies varies from outcrop to outcrop. Sediments are very locally derived, therefore sequence vary considerably with composition of the substrate source.|

37730|Bowgan Sandstone|Type section locality|Narrow strike ridge at 1759'S, 137E (705200mE 7999800mN) along Murphys Creek in Canyon Range, MOUNT DRUMMOND. Locality lies along main outcrop belt and is therefore most representative of formation, but difficult to access. In this area, Bowgan Sandstone overlies Buddycurrawa Volcanics of Benmara Group.
Reference section: Narrow isolated strike ridge at 185'S, 13656'E (712400mE 8009850mN) along Pandanus Creek in northern Canyon Range, MOUNT DRUMMOND. Outcrop adjacent to BenmaraWangalinji road and reasonably easy to access, but may not be representative of whole formation. At this locality, 50 m of Bowgan Sandstone overlies Breakfast Sandstone of Benmara Group, with basal lithified palaeoregolith.|
37730|Bowgan Sandstone|Extent|Northwestern MOUNT DRUMMOND and southwestern CALVERT HILLS, in Canyon Range (name newly approved by Committee for Geographic Names in Australasia). Outcrop extends along north-northeasterly belt on eastern fringe of Canyon Range, from headwaters of Benmara Creek in south (695000mE 7982000mN in MOUNT DRUMMOND) to Pandanus Creek in north (705000mE 8012000mN in CALVERT HILLS).|
37730|Bowgan Sandstone|Thickness range|Up to 100 m, but generally about 10 m.|
37730|Bowgan Sandstone|Lithology|Maroon to pink or red-brown, variably ferruginous, lithic to sublithic, fine- to coarse-grained sandstone, with occasional laminae of quartz granules and small pebbles. In hand specimen, sandstone has notable `speckled appearance, due to presence of white lithic fragments in pink ferruginous background. Unit medium to thickly bedded with planar bedding, a parting lineation, small-scale trough cross-beds and mudstone intraclasts. Subtle large bedforms may also be present. Chert pebbles and cobbles recognised near base at some localities (eg 702650mE 7992300mN). At 705200mE 8081800mN, a thin interval of polymict breccia is recognised at base of formation, comprising angular clasts of sandstone, claystone and ?chert in coarse-grained sandstone matrix.|
37730|Bowgan Sandstone|Depositional environment|Braided fluvial to shallow-marine intertidal.|
37730|Bowgan Sandstone|Relationships and boundaries|Parent units: Wild Cow Subgroup, South Nicholson Group.
Unconformably overlies Murphy Metamorphics and Benmara Group. Base not exposed, but breccia with polymict clasts recognised at some localities. Contact either low-angle unconformity or layer-parallel fault. Latter could imply that Benmara and South Nicholson groups were once stratigraphically contiguous and conformable, and subsequently became structurally bound. Unconformity is favoured herein, based on consistent stratigraphic position of the discontinuity, and the different facies of the two groups (eg volcanic in Benmara Group but not in South Nicholson Group). Conformably overlain by Crow Formation, but contact not well exposed, due to recessive nature of rock types in transition zone. In most instances, contact marked by development of distinctive chert, secondary ironstone or clay-rich caliche, perhaps after sulfidic shale. At 701850E 7989650N, possible chertified digitate stromatolites are interbedded with white claystone and sandstone at contact.|
37730|Bowgan Sandstone|Age reasons|Maximum age constrained only by underlying Cliffdale Volcanics basement (>1845 Ma; Page et al 2000). Immediately underlying Buddycurrawa Volcanics undated, but could potentially be in range 1725-1580 Ma. Minimum age is that of overlying late Neoproterozoic to Phanerozoic Georgina Basin. Based on correlation of South Nicholson Group with Roper Group, probable age range of 1500-1400 Ma can be proposed for South Nicholson Group, and hence for Bowgan Sandstone (Jackson et al 1999, Abbott et al 2001).|
37730|Bowgan Sandstone|Correlations|Probably Playford Sandstone, which forms base of South Nicholson Group south and southeast of Benmara Fault in northwestern MOUNT DRUMMOND.|

37732|Breakfast Sandstone|Lithology|Comprises a resistant, banded strike ridge of white to maroon or pink, medium+/-coarse grained silicified sublithic sandstone. The lower few metres contains abundant quartz pebbles and lesser cobbles. The sequence tends to fine upwards, with small-scale (dm wavelength) trough cross-beds, planar bedding, symmetrical ripples, desiccation cracks and current lineation becoming increasingly common. Otherwise, it is medium- to thick-bedded with mudclasts, scattered quartz granules and small pebbles, and white angular silicified mudstone ('chert') clasts up to 5 cm diameter. The unit also contains rare laminae or thin beds of chertified mudstone and chertified carbonate with relict domal stromatolites.

38038|Brumby Formation (NT)|Thickness range|350 m at the type section, thickening to the northwest and west to up to 800 m.|
38038|Brumby Formation (NT)|Lithology|A heterogeneous unit including laminated and stromatolitic chert and possibly dolostone, chert-clast conglomerate and breccia, sandstone and granule conglomerate, and siltstone and shale.|
38038|Brumby Formation (NT)|Depositional environment|Mainly shallow marine, ranging from supratidal to subtidal; some non-marine intervals - fluvial conglomerates and breccias, and in upper part of formation deeper marine, low energy environments.|
38038|Brumby Formation (NT)|Relationships and boundaries|Conformable on the Drummond Formation, the contact being placed at the point where chert and fine siliciclastics become dominant over sandstone. The upper contact, with the Shady Bore Quartzite, is sharp but probably conformable; it is not exposed. Both upper and lower contacts correspond to marked topographic changes, which facilitates their mapping from air photographs. Parent unit: McNamara Group.|
38038|Brumby Formation (NT)|Age reasons|Maximum age constrained by Top Rocky Rhyolite, dated at 1725+/-3 Ma (Page et al 2000); younger limit established by correlation with McNamara Group in Lawn Hill region to the east - eg, ages of 1658-1653 Ma for the Paradise Creek Formation (Page et al 2000), with which the Brumby Formation in part correlates with (see below).|

37731|Buddycurrawa Volcanics|Thickness range|Ranges from 0 m to an estimated maximum of 300 m, implied from outcrop width and dip calculations. Basal ferruginous sandstone is 10-20 m thick.|06/FEB/12
37731|Buddycurrawa Volcanics|Lithology|Comprises an interval of ferruginous sandstone (basal unit), overlain by a mixed sequence of coherent trachyte, debris flow sandstone and conglomerate, mature sandstone, ferruginous siltstone/fine sandstone and minor but distinctive stromatolitic chert horizon(s).|06/FEB/12
37731|Buddycurrawa Volcanics|Relationships and boundaries|Rests conformably on Breakfast Sandstone, the boundary marked by a transition from relatively well-sorted quartzose sandstone into poorly-sorted ferruginous sandstone and ironstone. The volcanics are overlain by Bowgan Sandstone and, locally, Crow Formation of the South Nicholson Group. This contact is poorly exposed and relationships are speculative. Pinching out of the Benmara Group to the north near 705000E 8007000N is consistent with either an unconformity or a low-angle structural boundary (detachment) at the base of the South Nicholson Group. Rawlings et al (in prep) favour a slightly reactivated unconformity. Parent unit: Benmara Group.|06/FEB/12
37731|Buddycurrawa Volcanics|Age reasons|Constrained only by the underlying Murphy Metamorphics and Connellys Volcanics basement (>1845 Ma; Page et al 2000) and probable overlying South Nicholson Group (maximum age ~1500 Ma; by correlation with Roper Group; Jackson et al 1999, Abbott et al 2001). Unable to date the contained trachyte due to a lack of zircons and strong weathering (Rawlings et al in prep). The obvious interpretation is that the Buddycurrawa Volcanics are the same age as the Carrara Range Group and Peters Creek Volcanics (~1725 Ma), which also contain abundant felsic volcanics and shallow intrusives. However, an age closer to 1660-1580 Ma can be implied from their compositional similarity to magmatic rocks in the Coanjula area (Rawlings et al in prep).|06/FEB/12

29219|Bullion Schist|Geomorphic expression|Low, undulating terrain with small strike ridges. Common vein quartz ridges.|
29219|Bullion Schist|Type section locality|Near the Home of Bullion mine between AMG GR MS122203 (latitude 21o30'53"S, longitude 134o09'08"E) and GR MS124214 (latitude 21o30'19"S, longitude 134o09'16") on the Home of Bullion sheet (5754). Here most of the rock types described below are present except for the porphyritic felsic volcanics.|

29219|Bullion Schist|Thickness range|Unknown due to incomplete sections and structural complexities. About 2 km of section is exposed in the type area (no base or top exposed) provided that it contains no unrecognised isoclinal folding.|
29219|Bullion Schist|Lithology|(In decreasing order of abundance): Metapelite: fine-grained quartz-muscovite schist and quartz-muscovite-biotite schist, fine-grained quartz-sericite/muscovite+andalusite schist; fine chlorite common, common opaque minerals, elongate aggregates of sericite and chloritoid (up to 30 mm diameter) at AMG GR LS762328 and near Home of Bullion mine may be retrograde alteration of cordierite or staurolite(?); thinly bedded.  Meta-arenite to wacke: fine- to coarse-grained quartz + plagioclase/microcline-muscovite and/or biotite schist, common opaque minerals; rare sillimanite; some fine chlorite; very fine- to fine-grained quartz-tourmaline and quartz-muscovite-tourmaline rock near Barrow Creek Granite Complex; thinly bedded (e.g. at AMG GR LS905317 and GR MS112239).  Quartz-mica schist: fine- to coarse-grained, quartz-biotite (sometimes retrogressed to chlorite)-sericite/muscovite+andalusite+microcline/plagioclase+cordierite+anthophyllite+garnet+opaques (e.g. at the Home of Bullion mine).

38039|Bullrush Conglomerate|Unit history|Previously mapped as Maloney Formation (South Nicholson Group) on the first edition of MOUNT DRUMMOND by Smith and Roberts (1963), and as lower Musselbrook Formation (McNamara Group) by Sweet (1985). Both Maloney and Musselbrook are now obsolete units, although the Bullrush Conglomerate is still included in the McNamara Group.|06/FEB/12

38039|Bullrush Conglomerate|Comments|This facies is not present in McNamara Group in any other locality, and it is the stratigraphic position of the Bullrush Conglomerate, in roughly the middle of the McNamara Group and at the transition from dominantly carbonate environments below, to deeper marine siliciclastic-dominated environments above, which allows its correlation as described above.

3012|Bungitina metamorphics|Name source|Named after Bungitina Well (cba) on the upper reaches of Maude Creek, 9 km south of Mount Brassey in the northeastern part of the Riddoch 1:100 000 Sheet area.|
3012|Bungitina metamorphics|Unit history|A group of lensic bodies of quartz feldspathic gneiss, referred to by Joklik (1955 p.43) as the Bungitine Granodiorite (R4787, R4588) are identical to many other quartzofeldspathic gneisses in the principal outcrop area, so Joklik's  unit has been extended to include all the quartzo feldspathic gneisses and subordinate mafic rocks that together had been mapped by Joklik as granitised Irindina Gneiss.|
3012|Bungitina metamorphics|Type section locality|Reference Section: Florence Creek between GR 5851-847427 and 836381.|
3012|Bungitina metamorphics|Extent|The principal outcrop area is a rugged belt of hills and ridges, some 3 km wide, which strike south-southwest from Mount Brassey in the Alice Springs 1:250 000 Sheet area. The metamorphics also crop out near the confluence of Florence and Maude Creeks, and between Muller Flat Dam and the junction of Florence Creek with the Hale River.|07/JUN/12
3012|Bungitina metamorphics|Lithology|The metamorphics consist mainly of a very fine grained quartzofeldspathic gneiss which is generally garnetiferous and subordinate amphibolite. Rarer rock types include clinopyroxene or hornblende bearing plagioclase rock, garnet quartzite, biotite schist, calc-silicate rock and megacrystic feldspar gneiss. An unusual Mg-rich unit noted for its basemetal content is present at the Oonagalabi Prospect. The Mg-unit includes anthophyllite rock and clinopyroxene rock. Informal subdivision of unit: The unit is informally subdivided into a presumed lower (pCsb2) and upper (pCsb1) units. The lower unit is more extensive, has a higher proportion of quartzofeldspathic gneiss, contains amphibolite bodies that are commonly discordant and lensic. The upper unit contains a more diverse group of rock types including the Mg-rich rock, the megacrystic feldspar gneiss, and a schistose garnetiferous biotite gneiss. Rock types common to both informal units include the distinctive quartzofeldspathic gneiss, amphibolite, hornblende- or clinopyroxene plagioclase rock and calc-silicate rock.|07/JUN/12
3012|Bungitina metamorphics|Relationships and boundaries|The metamorphics are assigned to the Strangways Metamorphic Complex. They are thought to be conformably overlain by the Cadney metamorphics and unconformably overlain by the Irindina gneiss which belongs to the Harts Range Group. The relationship between the Bungitina metamorphics and the Naringa calcareous member of the Irindina Gneiss which directly overlies it is obscured by a zone of tectonic disturbance which develops into a major tectonic slide. Locally, porphyroblastic K-feldspar gneiss assigned to the Baume Gneiss, also belonging to the Harts Range Group, overlies the Bungitina metamorphics (e.g. along Florence Creek upstream of its junction with Maude Creek). At the southwestern extremity of the principal outcrop area highly deformed Bungitina metamorphics pass progressively into the Gough Dam Schist Zone; the boundary being arbitrarily defined by the incoming of muscovite and, as such, is largely a reflection of metamorphic grade.|
3012|Bungitina metamorphics|Age reasons|The age of the metamorphics in unknown. They are presumed to have been regionally metamorphosed at 1800 m.y. like other units of the Strangways Metamorphic Complex, but are thought to have undergone a later second metamorphism to account for the extremely fine recrystallised texture.|
33171|Burash Sandstone|Name source|Burash Waterhole, in eastern part of Tanumbirini 1:250 000 sheet area (16o11'S, 134o50'E).|

33171|Burash Sandstone|Type section locality|Adjacent to Five Mile Spring around 16o07.5', 134o54.5'E. The 370 m thick type section runs from 489670E 8217180N (16o07.5'S, 134o54.2'E; base) to 487950E 8216250N (16o08.05'S, 134o53.2'E; top), the former also representing the lower boundary stratotype. No upper boundary stratotype is assigned.|
33171|Burash Sandstone|Extent|Exposed only in the northeastern part of the Tanumbirini sheet area, along Eight Mile Creek, in the Tanumbirini Inlier.|
33171|Burash Sandstone|Thickness range|>370 m.|
33171|Burash Sandstone|Lithology|White to pink, silicified, cross-bedded, fine- to medium-grained quartzose sandstone, with minor coarse or granular intervals near top.|
33171|Burash Sandstone|Depositional environment|High-energy shallow water environment.|
33171|Burash Sandstone|Relationships and boundaries|Conformably overlies the Nyanantu Formation, the contact marked by a transition from pebbly lithic (volcanogenic) sandstone into medium-grained quartzose sandstone. Overlain by Roper Group, but contact not exposed.|
33171|Burash Sandstone|Age reasons|Palaeoproterozoic. Maximum age constrained by SHRIMP U-Pb zircon date of ~1713 Ma for underlying Tanumbirini Rhyolite (Page and Sweet, 1998). Conformable relationship suggests Burash Sandstone is only marginally younger than this date.|
33171|Burash Sandstone|Correlations|Possibly the Parson Range Group in eastern Arnhem Land.|
33171|Burash Sandstone|Comments|The outcrops now assigned to the Burash Sandstone were initially assigned by Paine (1963) to the `Masterton Formation', a mixed volcanic and sedimentary package. Jackson et al. (1987) subsequently applied the name Masterton Sandstone to the sandstone units and assigned separate names to the volcanic components. The Masterton Sandstone is now known to be the basal unit of the McArthur Group. As the sandstones overlying the Tanumbirini Rhyolite in this area have greater affinity with the Tawallah Group, and can not be readily correlated with the Masterton Sandstone or any of the upper units of the Tawallah Group, a new name is required.|

24806|Cahill Formation|Unit history|Dunn, 1962 included these rocks in his 'South Alligator Group' and suggested some exposures were Koolpin Formation.|11/APR/12
24806|Cahill Formation|Type section locality|No surface exposure gives an adequate indication of the lithology of the unit due to deep weathering and cover of younger strata. The succession within the unit has been adequately established by rotary-percussion drill traverses in the Cahill and Jim Jim sheet areas (BMR Jim Jim Nos 1-70 inclusive, BMR Cahill Nos 15-77 inclusive, drill holes) and all exposures of the unit can be suitably correlated with the drill traverse data. Of the 3 traverses drilled, the Jabiru Traverse is the proposed type section, and the Koongarra and Mount Basedow Traverses are suitable reference sections. Full results of the drilling are given by Stuart-Smith & Hone, 1976. The drill traverses are shown graphically on continuation card no. 3. The best surface exposure is a road cutting on the Arnhem Highway at 398019 in the Cahill Sheet area - see continuation card no. 4. The dip of the beds in the type section varies from 0o to 90o with a predominance of dips between 35o and 45o.|11/APR/12

24806|Cahill Formation|Thickness range|Range 2000-3000 m.|11/APR/12
24806|Cahill Formation|Lithology|A lower carbonate-carbonaceous schist sequence (pyritic carbonaceous mica schist, chloritized feldspathic quartzite, quartzschist, amphibole schist, dolomite, chert) and an upper feldspathic quartzite and quartz schist sequence (interlayered feldspathic quartzschist, feldspathic schist, feldspathic quartzite, minor amphibolite, mica schist and quartzo-feldspathic gneiss). In the centre of the uranium field exposure is mostly quartzite, and silicified carbonate. The metamorphic grade is generally staurolite-almandine sub-facies of the amphibolite facies; dominance of phyllite over schist in the Jim Jim Sheet area suggest a slightly low metamorphic grade in that area;; in the Oenpelli Sheet area in the northeast, the Cahill Formation is folded into the migmatite terrain of the Nimbuway Complex and gneiss and migmatite predominate - however, marble, quartzite and carbonaceous schist still identify the unit.|11/APR/12
24806|Cahill Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Overlies (contact is sheared, probably unconformable) Lower Proterozoic Mount Partridge Formation and Archaean-Lower Proterozoic Nanambu Complex (metapsammite, phyllite; leucocratic gneiss and granite) (Needham et al., 1974). Carbonate rock types mostly indicate proximity of base. Transitionally (contact appears gradational) overlain by Lower Proterozoic Fisher Creek Siltstone (Walpole et al., 1968).|11/APR/12
24806|Cahill Formation|Age reasons|Lower Proterozoic. Metamorphosed by ~1800 m.y. regional event, overlies Nanambu Complex mantled gneiss dome reactivated at ~2020 m.y. (Page, 1974).|11/APR/12

24210|Canulgerra Sandstone|Type section locality|4 km NW of Canulgerra Rockhole (latitude 20o49'30"S, longitude 135o37'30"E), Hanlon 1:100 000 Sheet area: from GR 615006, where the formation conformably overlies Lennee Creek Formation, to GR 632020, where it is overlain conformably by Vaddingilla Formation. Here the Canulgerra Sandstone is about 500 m thick, dips 15o-30oE, and is well exposed in strike ridges.|
24210|Canulgerra Sandstone|Extent|Three outcrop areas, one in western Hanlon 1:100 000 Sheet area, the other two in eastern central Bonney and eastern central Davenport Range 1:100 000 Sheet areas, Bonney Well 1:250 000 Sheet area.|
24210|Canulgerra Sandstone|Thickness range|Generally about 500 m.|
24210|Canulgerra Sandstone|Lithology|Ridge-forming quartzose to feldspathic arenite and interbanded recessive friable arenite, micaceous siltstone, and mudstone; minor conglomerate.|
24210|Canulgerra Sandstone|Relationships and boundaries|Conformable on recessive Lennee Creek Formation and overlain conformably by recessive Vaddingilla Formation; basal contact invariably concealed. Lower and upper contacts taken at abrupt topographic change from ridge-forming arenite of the Canulgerra Sandstone to recessive beds of underlying and overlying units.|
24210|Canulgerra Sandstone|Age reasons|Younger than 1870 m.y. - U-Pb zircon age of volcanics in the Warramunga Group, which is overlain unconformably by the Hatches Creek Group. Older than 1640 m.y.-Rb-Sr wholerock approximate age of granite intruding the Hatches Creek Group.|

21470|Cato Volcanics|Name source|Cato River (AMG PG500390, Arnhem Bay 1:250 000 scale mapsheet area), a tidal- and fresh-water river which flows into the eastern side of Arnhem Bay.|
21470|Cato Volcanics|Unit history|Previously undifferentiated "Spencer Creek Volcanics" of Dunnet (1965).|
21470|Cato Volcanics|Geomorphic expression|Typically recessive outcrop of blocks, boulders and low rubbly rises.|
21470|Cato Volcanics|Type section locality|At lat. 12o11'20''S, long. 136o30'E. Base of section is at AMG PG636512 (Arnhem Bay) and top is at PG618528 (Gove mapsheet area). However, as actual contacts are not exposed, no boundary stratotypes could be defined.|
21470|Cato Volcanics|Extent|Outcrop is confined to a very small area 20 km northwest of Yanungbi outstation, adjacent to the Peter John River floodplain, in northeastern Arnhem Bay and northwestern Gove 1:250 000 scale mapsheet areas.|
21470|Cato Volcanics|Thickness range|400 m at type section. To the north and south, the sequence has been removed by the unconformity at the base of the overlying Mount Bonner Sandstone.|
21470|Cato Volcanics|Lithology|Pink, red or brown felsic igneous rock (rhyolite). It is porphyritic, with phenocrysts of K-feldspar, quartz, and minor plagioclase and pyroxene, set in a dark brown to black cryptocrystalline groundmass. Some of the fresher outcrop is very hard and has a notable sugary texture and sub-conchoidal fracture, suggesting it has been recrystallised. Possible relict pyroclastic textures in thin-section.|
21470|Cato Volcanics|Depositional environment|Most likely extrusive (volcanic), possibly pyroclastic.|
21470|Cato Volcanics|Relationships and boundaries|Upper igneous unit of the Spencer Creek Group. Apparently conformably or mildly disconformably overlying the Yuduyudu Formation and probably disconformably overlain by the Rorruwuy Sandstone. The contact with the underlying unit is poorly exposed and is interpreted as conformable on the basis of concordance, and the absence of unconformity-diagnostic features. The contact with the overlying Rorruwuy Sandstone is also poorly exposed, but is interpreted as disconformable... There is apparent concordance between the two units, and the basal sandstone beds are mature and free of conglomerate. Sandstone is also locally overturned (faulted?) adjacent to the contact, suggesting it may be partly faulted. Along strike, beyond the present exposures, the Cato Volcanics are probably unconformably overlain by Mount Bonner Sandstone.|
21470|Cato Volcanics|Age reasons|Palaeoproterozoic (Statherian). The age of this formation, from analysis of single zircon grains by SHRIMP U-Pb geochronological techniques, is ~1710 Ma (Rawlings and others, in prep.).|
21470|Cato Volcanics|Correlations|Rawlings and others (in prep.) and Rawlings (1994) suggest correlation with the upper parts of the Tawallah and Katherine River Groups in the southern and western McArthur Basin respectively. Locally, it correlates to the felsic igneous Fagan Volcanics in southern Arnhem Bay and northern Blue Mud Bay, and tentatively with the Gadabara Volcanics in eastern Blue Mud Bay mapsheet areas. These correlations are based on geochemical, petrological, lithostratigraphic and geochronological constraints, and the physical form of igneous units.|

37728|Caulfield beds|Thickness range|Up to 600 m.|06/FEB/12
37728|Caulfield beds|Lithology|Dominated by yellow to red/brown lithic micaceous coarse- to very coarse-grained pebble-bearing sandstone and pebble to boulder conglomerate. These are poorly sorted with very high lithic component and a dominantly metamorphic-felsic igneous provenance. They form 0.5-8 m thick benches/beds, generally lacking internal stratification. Interbedded with coarse facies is minor fine- to medium-grained lithic sandstone and micaceous siltstone with small to medium scale trough cross-beds, planar bedding, parting lineation and interference ripples. Also interbedded (or forming allochthonous blocks) within the sequence are sandy and pebbly dolarenite, dolorudite, dololutite and dolomitic-lithic sandstone. The top 100 m of the unit comprises chertified dolostone and yellow fine+/-medium grained, quartzose to sublithic, silicified, micaceous sandstone with small trough cross-beds, planar bedding and parting lineation. Also present is flaggy, slabby, platy or shaly outcrop of red/brown to green or yellow, micaceous siltstone, fine- to very fine-grained lithic sandstone and shale. Bedding is planar or lenticular with common parallel lamination.|06/FEB/12
37728|Caulfield beds|Depositional environment|Probably marine, possibly fan-delta debris-flow and submarine talus deposits.|06/FEB/12
37728|Caulfield beds|Relationships and boundaries|Basal relationship unknown, as underlying rocks are not exposed. Unconformably but concordantly overlain by Constance Sandstone of the South Nicholson Group.|06/FEB/12
37728|Caulfield beds|Age reasons|Maximum age constrained by a lack of metamorphism and deformation of Caulfield beds (therefore younger than nearby >1845 Ma Cliffdale Volcanics basement; Page et al 2000). Minimum age constrained by correlation of the overlying Constance Sandstone with the Mesoproterozoic Roper superbasin, which is 1500-1400 Ma (Jackson et al 1999, Abbott et al 2001). Rocks above the probable equivalent of the Constance Sandstone in the Roper Group yield a date of 1493+/-4 Ma, suggesting that the Caulfield beds are around, or greater than 1500 Ma in age.|06/FEB/12
37728|Caulfield beds|Correlations|Tentatively correlated with the Crow Formation (South Nicholson Group) because it contains similar coarse-grained gravity-flow facies in the Benmara-Canyon Range area. In addition, the contact with the overlying Constance Sandstone (a probable correlative of the Mittiebah Sandstone, South Nicholson Group) is essentially concordant, and may represent a relatively minor hiatus. Correlation with the Fickling and McNamara Groups appears less likely, because they only rarely contain similar facies. However, the middle to upper McNamara Group in the Maloney Creek Inlier includes mixed coarse-grained siliciclastic and carbonate facies (Sweet 1985), and correlation with this part of the McNamara Group cannot be ruled out.|06/FEB/12

3865|Central Mount Stuart Formation|Name source|The name is derived from Central Mount Stuart (Yard grid reference: 67000E, 2263000N), the highest point in the Johns Range in the southeastern part of the Mount Peake 1:250 000 Sheet area, and situated nearly at the geographical centre of Australia.|
3865|Central Mount Stuart Formation|Type section locality|A lithologic type section has been measured in two parts at Central Mount Stuart; this was necessitated by the fact that the basal unconformity is exposed at one locality in the Johns Range, whereas the top of the sequence is situated at another locality 4 km from the first and separated by a northwest-trending fault. The top most bed of the lower part of the section was traced by airphoto interpretation along strike from the southwestern block across the fault into the northeastern block, and the upper part of the section measured from there to the summit of Central Mount Stuart. The base of the lower part of the type section is at yard grid reference 675500E, 2259000N, and its top at 675200E, 2265200N; the base of the upper part of the type section is at yard grid reference 677600E, 2261800N, and its top at the summit of Central Mount Stuart, yard grid reference 677000E, 2263000N. The sequence in the type section can be divided into two main parts, a pelitic and calcareous lower unit and a psammitic upper unit each about 400 m thick. The lower unit begins with about 4 m of tillite, followed by 25 m of interbedded pebble conglomerate and limestone without conglomerate. These rocks are overlain by 25 m of purple-brown calcareous quartz sandstone and green or purple shale. These are overlain by about 220 m of interbedded greenish-grey feldspathic non-calcareous quartz sandstone and purple silty shale. The upper unit consists of about 400 m of grey-red to purple, brown feldspathic quartz sandstone, fine to medium to coarse-grained, cross-bedded, and containing abundant granules of quartz and feldspar.|
3865|Central Mount Stuart Formation|Extent|The Central Mount Stuart Beds crop out over an area about 100 km by 200 km, in the Mount Peake, Barrow Creek, Alcoota, and Napperby 1:250 000 Sheet areas.|
3865|Central Mount Stuart Formation|Thickness range|The thickness measured in the type section totals 800 m; elsewhere in the Mount Peake Sheet area the thickness is less than this. In the Barrow Creek Sheet area, the average thickness is about 140 m, with a maximum of about 250 m (Smith & Milligan, 1964). In the Alcoota Sheet area, the thickness is 760 m at Mount Skinner and 445 m east of there (estimated from magnetic data, Shaw et al., in prep.) In the Napperby Sheet area, the thicknesses of the various outliers are estimated at about 150 m (Evans & Glikson, 1969).|
3865|Central Mount Stuart Formation|Lithology|The Central Mount Stuart Beds are a dominantly red-bed sequence comprising several different rock-types. In the Mount Peake 1:250 000 Sheet area, it consists of either local tillite, or arkosic conglomerate, or calcareous pelite at the base, overlain respectively by grey or yellow pelite, grey arkose, or red-brown coarse feldspathic quartz sandstone. In the eastern part of the Mount Peake 1:250 000 Sheet ara, the Beds begin with a distinctive orthoquartzite (the Amesbury Quartzite Member; see attached submission) about 20 m thick, and this is overlain by feldspathic quartz sandstone. In the Barrow Creek 1:250 000 Sheet area, the Beds begin with brown silty sandstone, siltstone, and pebble conglomerate, followed by red arkose, sandstone, and greywacke, with interbeds of siltstone and rare dolomite (Smith & Milligan, 1964). In the Alcoota 1:250 000 Sheet area, the Beds comprise (i) a local basal unit of grey or white feldspathic quartz sandstone with lenses of conglomerate, (ii) a thick extensive unit of red lithic feldspathic quartz sandstone and shale with calcareous sandstone at the base and dolomite near the base, plus some grey sandstone and siltstone interbeds, and (iii) an upper unit of quartz sandstone and feldspathic quartz sandstone (Shaw et al., in prep.). In the Napperby 1:250 000 Sheet area, the Beds form a few isolated outliers, variously consisting of feldspathic quartz sandstone, conglomerate, tillite, and siltstone (Evans & Glikson, 1969).|
3865|Central Mount Stuart Formation|Relationships and boundaries|In the Mount Peake and Napperby 1:250 000 Sheet areas, the Central Mount Stuart Beds rest unconformably on granite or amphibolite of the Arunta Block, and the unconformity is well exposed at numerous localities; no unit overlies the Beds in these Sheet areas, and the top of the Beds is eroded. In the Barrow Creek 1:250 000 Sheet area, the Central Mount Stuart Beds rest unconformably on granite and metamorphic rocks of the Arunta Block, and are conformably overlain by a formation which contains Early Cambrian fossils (Smith & Milligan, 1964). The nature of the lithological change and how it is distinguished in the field are not described by Smith & Milligan, nor by Smith (1972), and the area in question has not been visited by us; presumably the change in lithological characteristics from red thick-bedded arkose and medium-bedded sandstone and greywacke of the Central Mount Stuart Beds to brown, grey, or red glauconitic quartz sandstone and brown or white siltstone of the overlying formation is fairly apparent. The overlying unit was designated as Grant Bluff Formation by Smith & Milligan, but later work by Shaw et al. (in prep.) has shown that this unit is lithologically more similar to the Mount Baldwin Formation, which also contains Early Cambrian fossils and conformably overlies the Grant Bluff Formation in the Huckitta 1:250 000 Sheet area. Drilling near Mount Skinner in the Alcoota 1:250 000 Sheet area found that the Grant Bluff Formation underlies the Central Mount Stuart Beds. On the other hand, Shaw et al. state that the grey sandstones in the Central Mount Stuart Beds in the Alcoota Sheet area are not unlike similar beds in the Grant Bluff Formation, and we have noted that various rock types in the lower part of the Central Mount Stuart Beds and in the upper part of the Grant Bluff Formation (in the Elyuah Range of the Huckitta Sheet area) are lithologically similar to each other and to certain members of the Pertatataka Formation in the Amadeus Basin to the south. It thus appears that the lower part of the Central Mount Stuart Beds is a facies equivalent of the upper part of the Grant Bluff Formation. Shaw et al. also suggest that the boundary of the Central Mount Stuart Beds and Grant Bluff Formation may be time-transgressive, i.e., it rises up section to the south and brings the Grant Bluff Formation directly underneath the Mount Baldwin Formation. In the Alcoota 1:250 000 Sheet area, the Central Mount Stuart Beds are juxtaposed against the Upper Cambrian to Lower Ordovician Tomahawk Beds, but the contact is obscured by alluvium; a fault with a displacement of about 1.5 km may exist, but Shaw et al. believe that an unconformable on-lapping relationship of Tomahawk Beds on to Central Mount Stuart Beds is more likely.|
3865|Central Mount Stuart Formation|Identifying features|Reason for proposed name: The unit was originally named the Central Mount Stuart Beds by Smith & Milligan (1964). However, field mapping in 1974 located several excellent exposures of the lower boundary of the Beds, and the upper boundary coincides with the base of a conformably overlying formation in the Barrow Creek 1:250 000 Sheet araea. Hence, we wish to redefine the Beds as the Central Mount Stuart Formation. Furthermore, a type section has been measured at Central Mount Stuart, where the base is well exposed, and a minimum thickness established there (the top being eroded).|
3865|Central Mount Stuart Formation|Age reasons|The existence of tillite in the lower part of the Central Mount Stuart Beds indicates an Adelaidean age for this part of the formation, and the presence of worm burrows, bilobate tails, and other trace fossils in the upper part of the unit indicates a very early Cambrian age (Glaessner, 1969; Daily, 1974). Hence, the Central Mount Stuart Beds straddle the Precambrian-Cambrian boundary.|
26298|Chabalowe Formation|Name source|After Chabalowe bore in Barrow Creek !:250 000 Sheet area at AMG reference MS619500.|
26298|Chabalowe Formation|Unit history|Previously included in the Tomahawk beds by Smith and Milligan (1964 and 1966).|
26298|Chabalowe Formation|Type section locality|Holostratotype: In NTGS BC5, from 166.90 to 327.43 m. The collar locality is AMG reference MS156765 in Barrow Creek 1:250 000 Sheet area (latitude 21o0'44"S, longitude 134o11'16"E). Shows 36 m of conglomerate and sandstone at the base, overlain by 160 m of typical lithology (sandstone, dolostone). The top is identified by gradation from sandstone-dominant to carbonate-dominant sequence, the base by unconformity on Proterozoic granite.  Parastratotype: In NTGS ELK7, 7A from 15.00 to 238.05 m. The collar locality is AMG reference NS 162052 in Elkedra (latitude 21o39.5'S, longitude 135o9.5'E). Top is not exposed, upper 153 m is similar to holostratotype, lower 95 m constitutes gypsum-rich beds and dolostone of the Hagen Member. Base is identified by gradation into dark carbonaceous and fossiliferous dolarenites and dolomitic siltstone of Arthur Creek Formation.  Reference locality: About 8.5 km south-southeast of Chabalowe bore around AMG reference MS657422 in Barrow Creek. Poorly exposed as low rises of ferruginised sandstone minor chert and very rare dolostone. No formation boundaries seen on the ground surface.|
26298|Chabalowe Formation|Extent|Crops out over 90 km in distance between Chabalowe bore in Barrow Creek and Honeymoon bore on Elkedra; intersected in NTGS diamond drillholes ELK6, 7 and 7A and BC 3 and 3A and 5 (all core is stored in the NTGS core store in Alice Springs).|
26298|Chabalowe Formation|Thickness range|The maximum known thickness is 300 m in NTGS DDH ELK6. The collar locality is AMG reference NR 051740.|
26298|Chabalowe Formation|Lithology|The lithology of the holostratotype NTGS DDH BC5 is summarised below.  39.50 m (166.00-205.50m). Sandy dolarenite and dolomitic sandstone with minor interbeds of mudstone and dolomicrite.  85.03 m (205.5-290.53 m). Dolomitic sandstone, in party sandy dolostone and rare dolarenite; minor interbeds of dolomicrite, dololutite, algal dolostone, partly micaceous and carbonaceous siltstone and rare intraformational breccia.  24.24 m (290.53-314.77 m). Granule to pebble conglomerate with granitic, metavolcanic and metaquartzite clasts in a sandy dolostone to dolomitic arkose matrix, sandstone with minor dolomite in matrix, minor dolarenite.  12.66 m (314.77-327.43 m). Conglomerate with granitic pebble clasts and minor metasediment and metavolcanic clasts, the matrix is a lithic arenite. This rests unconformably on a poorly foliated coarse-grained Proterozoic granite.  The lithology of the parastratotype NTGS DDH ELK7, 7A is described below. ELK7 ends at a depth of 71.75 m and ELK 7A begins at 65.61 m. Open hole above 15m. 31.33 m (15-46.33 m) Interbedded in part dolomitic siltstone, claystone and fine-grained sandstone; minor medium- to coarse-grained sandstone.  31.48 m (46.33-77.81 m) Interbedded dolomite, claystone and siltstone; minor fine- to medium-grained sandstone and intraformational breccia.   35.84 m (77.81-113.64 m) Fine- to medium-grained, porous sandstone with a dolomitic matrix in part, dolomite with chert nodules, algal laminate, dolarenite, claystone, siltstone and intraformational breccia. 39.48 m (113.64-153.48 m) Dolarenite, algal laminate, dolomite with chert nodules, dololutite, fine-grained sandstone, intraformational breccia.  The Hagen Member of the Chabalowe Formation begins at 153.48 m and ends at 248.76 m.  15.83 m (153.48-169.31 m) Interbedded gypsum, gypsiferous siltstone and chert (silicified algal laminate), minor anhydrite.  3.89 m (169.31-173.20 m) Dolostone, algal laminate and fine-grained dolarenite; minor dololutite.  9.38 m (173.20-182.58 m) Massive gypsum (satin spar) interbedded with siltstone, chert and dolostone, minor anhydrite.  55.47 m (182.58-238.05 m) Dolostone, in part stromatolitic, dolorudite, dolarenite, dololutite, intraformational breccia.  10.71 m (238.05-248.76 m) Dolostone silty grainstone, dolomitic siltstone.  Below 248.76 m is the Arthur Creek Formation.|
26298|Chabalowe Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Unconformable on Proterozoic granite and the Hatches Creek Group in Barrow Creek; in part laterally equivalent to and gradationally overlies the Templetonian Arthur Creek Formation in Elkedra; gradationally overlain by the Arrinthrunga Formation in Barrow Creek and Elkedra. In ELK6 and 7A contains a basal lensoidal grainstone shoal and sabkha unit defined as the Hagen Member.|
26298|Chabalowe Formation|Age reasons|Middle Cambrian based on lateral relationship with the Templetonian Arthur Creek Formation.|
27739|Chandler Formation|Name source|The name Chandler was first used by Ranford et al (1965) and although not specifically referred to it it thought to be derived from the Chandler Range which is 110 km southwest of Alice Springs.|
27739|Chandler Formation|Unit history|Previously referred to as the Chandler Limestone by Ranford et al. (1965).|
27739|Chandler Formation|Type section locality|This remains the same as inferred by Ranford et al. (1965), 10 kms north-east of Tempe Downs homestead (24o20'54" 132o29'50"). Its thickness can not be determined due to repetition of the sequence by thrust faulting and salt tectonics. An additional reference section occurs at Three Mile Waterhole on the Finke River, 10 km northwest of Henbury homestead (24o31'06" 133o13'03"). It has better access and exposure than the type section, and clearly shows the involvement of thrust faulting and salt tectonics typical of the unit.|
27739|Chandler Formation|Extent|Originally it was mapped in the east and central-east parts of the basin (Wells et al. 1970). It has been extended to the central-west part of the Amadeus Basin in the Gardiner Range, West Petermann Creek and Parana Hill Anticlines (Bradshaw, in prep.). Previously this had been described as a lens at the base of the Tempe Formation (Ranford et al, 1965), but detailed studies and drilling (Hermannsburg #41) shows it to be continuous and separated by a disconformity and erosion surface from the Tempe Formation.|
27739|Chandler Formation|Thickness range|In Camel Flat Syncline it is 670 m thick (Bluebush #1) with an average of 470 m, although it ranges up to >1000 m on seismic profiles (due to salt flowage). In Orange Creek Syncline it is 263 m thick (Gingo #2) with an average thickness of 225 m. In outcrop the carbonate lithofacies is only 5-10 m thick, although due to intense salt flowage and thrusting, the sequence is often repeated 5 or 6 times giving the appearance of a thick unit. This agrees with the central-west area where no salt is present and the carbonate is 15 m thick.|
27739|Chandler Formation|Lithology|Petroleum drilling has shown that the "Chandler Formation" is dominated by evaporites (Camel Flat Syncline-Bluebush #1). The evaporite minerals are mostely halite (>95%), with minor gypsum and sulphur. In the Orange Creek Syncline the sequence is (approx. 225 m thick, comprising 185 m of halite and 40 m of red siltstone, shale and dark grey foetid carbonate. The carbonate (from which the unit was originally named) is a mixture of limestone and dolomite in the eastern and central-east part of the basin, and is completely dolomitised in the central west. The carbonate is the only lithology to crop out.|
27739|Chandler Formation|Depositional environment|Bromine analysis of the halite suggests it was derived from a marine source. The foetid carbonate is subtidal, and has no shallow water indicators.|
27739|Chandler Formation|Relationships and boundaries|In the central-west the Chandler Formation disconformably overlies the Arumbera Sandstone and Namatjira Formation, and unconformably overlies the Areyonga and Bitter Springs Formations. In the eastern part of the basin it overlies all of the older units in the basin. The contacts are all structurally modified (due to salt tectonics and dissolution), but are believed to be at least disconformable and often are an unconformable relationship.|
27739|Chandler Formation|Age reasons|No fossils have been found, except for algal remains which are not age diagnostic. It is considered to be Early Cambrian in age.|

May be underlain to the north by orthogneiss. In MacDonnell Ranges 1:100 000 Sheet area the unit extends into the basement gneiss with apparent conformity. Dolerite dykes of the Stuart Dyke Swarm intrude the unit.|
3971|Chewings Range Quartzite|Identifying features|Reason for proposed name: The term Chewings Range Quartzite has been published previously but never defined in the strict sense.|
3971|Chewings Range Quartzite|Age reasons|Older than the Late Proterozoic Heavitree Quartzite which overlies it and the dolerite dykes which intrude it. Metamorphosed during the Chewings Phase of deformation at 1620 +/- 70 m.y.|

4021|Chiripee Gneiss|Lithology|Migmatitic garnet-biotite-feldspar gneiss; minor amphibolite (pCr1) and calc-silicate rock (pCr2 - 5 km northwest of 720 bore; muscovite-biotite gneiss. Resembles Langford Orthogneiss but lacks feldspar porphyroblasts. pCr2 - small outcrops area 5 km northwest of Lignum Dam - calc-silicate rock, quartzite, biotite gneiss. pCr3 - small area northwest of 720 bore - amphibolite (units pCr2 and pCr3 on Preliminary map only).|
4021|Chiripee Gneiss|Relationships and boundaries|Possibly overlies the Mount Bleechmore Granulite as it is of lower metamorphic grade (i.e. lacks sillimanite, cordierite and hypersthene typical of Mt Bleechmore Granulite. Unconformably overlain by Tertiary sediments. Faulted against other metamorphic units.|

21509|Coast Range Sandstone|Unit history|Formally mapped as part of the now abandoned 'Groote Eylandt Beds' (Plumb and Roberts, 1965).|
21509|Coast Range Sandstone|Geomorphic expression|Prominent, joint-controlled, bare rocky outcrops.|
21509|Coast Range Sandstone|Type section locality|Northern Coast Range at latitude 13o24'S, longitude 135o50'E, about 1 km east of the point where the only access track first meets the range. Lower boundary stratotype at AMG NF905180 and upper boundary stratotype top at AMG NG902180. This is the most accessible location with top and bottom exposed, and demonstrates all major subunits recognised in the area.|
21509|Coast Range Sandstone|Extent|Eastern Blue Mud Bay 1:250 000 scale map sheet area. Crops out at Coast Range, Mount Grindall, Round Hill Island, unnamed peninsula west of Jalma Bay and near Gan Gan community.|
21509|Coast Range Sandstone|Thickness range|Estimated to be about 30-40 m thick in the Mount Grindall area. About 20 m or less along Coast Range including type section. Locally removed by the unconformity at the base of the Jalma Formation near the southern end of Coast Range.|
21509|Coast Range Sandstone|Lithology|White, medium- to coarse-grained, thick-bedded, quartz-rich sandstone. Local lower unit of pale brown, poorly sorted, coarse- to very coarse-grained sandstone and granule conglomerate at type section. Commonly pebbly, with a lenticular basal pebble or cobble conglomerate.|
21509|Coast Range Sandstone|Depositional environment|Shallow marine, high energy, transgressive unit.|
21509|Coast Range Sandstone|Relationships and boundaries|Not assigned to any group. Lies unconformably on the Grindall Formation, Bradshaw Complex, unnamed porphyritic felsic dykes, and unnamed felsic volcanic unit. Boundary picked at marked angular unconformity below basal conglomerate or pebbly sandstone. Inferred to overlie the Woodah Sandstone near Grindall Point (nature of contact unknown). Overlain unconformably by the Jalma Formation. Top picked below the sudden incoming of fine-grained, flaggy sandstone of the Jalma Formation (type section), or locally below basal cobble conglomerate of that formation (south end of Coast Range). Intruded by mafic dykes.|
21509|Coast Range Sandstone|Age reasons|Probably late Palaeoproterozoic given tentative constraints provided by older and younger units. A maximum constraint is provided by the older porphyritic felsic dykes which are tentatively correlated on petrologic and geochemical grounds with the 1700-1710 Ma felsic suite of Rawlings (1994). The overlying Jalma Formation is tentatively correlated with the Balma Group, the top of which is dated at ~1600 Ma (Pietsch and others, 1994).|
21509|Coast Range Sandstone|Correlations|Tentatively correlated with the Parsons Range Group based on lithology and stratigraphic position.|

Where Chatsworth Limestone is absent, Cockroach Group is disconformable on Arrinthrunga Formation, Georgina Limestone and Mungerebar Limestone of Narpa Group. Conformably to locally disconformably overlain by Kelly Creek Formation of Toko Group or where this is absent, unconformably overlain by Mesozoic sedimentary rocks (Casey 1959, Shergold et al 1976, 1985).|12/OCT/10
37963|Cockroach Group|Age reasons|Fauna (particularly of trilobites and conodonts) indicates medial Late Cambrian (medial Iverian) to early Early Ordovician (late Warendian) to possibly medial Early Ordovician (Bendigonian) (Skwarko 1968, Shergold and Nicoll 1992)|12/OCT/10

37963|Cockroach Group|Comments|The Swift Formation is included in the group as it is regarded by Shergold et al (1976) and Druce et al (1982) as a subaerial regolith discordant on uppermost Ninmaroo Formation. The upper extent of the Cockroach Group is therefore diachronous: late Warendian or Bendigonian atop Ninmaroo Formation-Swift Formation to the east, but latest Late Cambrian (late Datsonian) atop Tomahawk Formation to the west (Shergold and Druce 1980:161, Jones et al 1971:21, Shergold and Nicoll 1992). A putative Early Ordovician fauna listed from Tomahawk Formation by Laurie (2000f) is stratigraphically below uppermost Tomahawk Formation limestone bearing Datsonian conodonts.|

68733|Connellys Volcanics|Name source|Connellys Waterhole, on Buddycurrawa Creek, near latitude 18o07'S longitude 137o08'E, a tributary to the Nicholson River in MOUNT DRUMMOND and CALVERT HILLS.|06/FEB/12
68733|Connellys Volcanics|Unit history|Previously mapped within (ie not differentiated from) the Murphy Metamorphics on the first editions of MOUNT DRUMMOND (Smith and Roberts 1963) and CALVERT HILLS (Roberts et al 1963).|06/FEB/12
68733|Connellys Volcanics|Geomorphic expression|Recessive with white or dark red/brown phototones.|06/FEB/12
68733|Connellys Volcanics|Type section locality|Type area: Low discontinuous exposures in the vicinity of latitude 18oS longitude 136o58'E (710000E 8007000N).|06/FEB/12
68733|Connellys Volcanics|Extent|Exposed in a small area near latitude 18oS longitude 136o58'E of the Canyon Range (newly approved by place names committee) at the boundary of northern MOUNT DRUMMOND and southern CALVERT HILLS.|06/FEB/12
68733|Connellys Volcanics|Thickness range|Unknown.|06/FEB/12
68733|Connellys Volcanics|Lithology|Red/brown 'brick' coloured, altered/weathered porphyritic rhyolite or rhyodacite, which generally has a mottled and highly weathered appearance that Rawlings et al (in prep) have termed 'redrock'.|06/FEB/12
68733|Connellys Volcanics|Relationships and boundaries|Field relationships cannot demonstrate an extrusive origin for the Connellys Volcanics and there are no preserved microscopic textures indicative of a pyroclastic or lava mode of emplacement.  The boundary of the Murphy Metamorphics and Connellys Volcanics is very poorly exposed, the best locality being 707400E 8009250N, where there is a juxtaposition of 'redrock' (Connellys Volcanics) and grey psammitic schist (Murphy Metamorphics). In the contact zone, 'redrock' becomes progressively more foliated westwards over a few tens of metres and grades into schist. The Connellys Volcanics are unconformably overlain by various units, including the Breakfast Sandstone (Benmara Group) and Bowgan Sandstone and Crow Formation (South Nicholson Group).|06/FEB/12
68733|Connellys Volcanics|Age reasons|Constrained only by the underlying Murphy Metamorphics (minimum age 1870 Ma; age of Barramundi Orogeny; Page and Williams 1988) and overlying South Nicholson Group (maximum age ~1500 Ma; by correlation with Roper Group; Jackson et al 1999, Abbott et al 2001). Most likely to be 1845-1860 Ma based on correlation with the Cliffdale Volcanics (dated by Page et al 2000).|06/FEB/12
68733|Connellys Volcanics|Correlations|Probably the Cliffdale Volcanics in CALVERT HILLS (Ahmad and Wygralak 1989).|06/FEB/12

24636|Cox Formation|Thickness range|The maximum preserved thickness is estimated to be about 50 m.|
24636|Cox Formation|Lithology|Lower part: fine- to very fine-grained micaceous sandstone thinly interbedded with micaceous siltstone. Upper part: red and green finely laminated siltstone and shale predominate over minor fine-grained sandstone interbeds.|
24636|Cox Formation|Depositional environment|Shallow marine subtidal setting.|
24636|Cox Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Conformably overlies the Bukalara Sandstone.

37729|Crow Formation|Name source|Crow Creek, in western MOUNT DRUMMOND, near latitude 18o27'S longitude 136o50'E.|06/FEB/12
37729|Crow Formation|Unit history|Encompasses about half of the outcrop that was formerly mapped as Mullera Formation by Smith and Roberts (1963) in the western half of the first edition of MOUNT DRUMMOND. It also incorporates a narrow strip of moderately resistant outcrop at the southern edge of the Mittiebah Range that was formerly mapped by Smith and Roberts (1963) as Mittiebah Sandstone. This Mittiebah Range outcrop, plus a similar narrow strip of Crow Formation along the Canyon Range, are reassigned to a separate upper member of the Crow Formation - the Tobacco Member. Crow Formation also includes a small anticlinal outcrop area in the Canyon Range (710000E 7995000N) that was incorrectly mapped as 'Benmara beds' by Smith and Roberts (1963).|06/FEB/12
37729|Crow Formation|Constituents|Tobacco Member (separate definition and type area).|06/FEB/12
37729|Crow Formation|Geomorphic expression|Recessive with variably white to dark phototones.|06/FEB/12
37729|Crow Formation|Type section locality|North-striking valley of moderately resistant outcrop at latitude 18o5'S longitude 136o55'E in the headwaters of Murphy's Creek in the Canyon Range in MOUNT DRUMMOND. The section runs from 705200E 8000000N (lower boundary) to 702000E 8000600N (upper boundary). In this area, Crow Formation conformably overlies Bowgan Sandstone and is in turn conformably overlain by Mittiebah Sandstone. Tobacco Member has not been differentiated out of the Crow Formation at this locality, so the type section includes a correlative section of Tobacco Member. This is designated as a reference section for the Tobacco Member.|06/FEB/12
37729|Crow Formation|Extent|Widespread in the western half of MOUNT DRUMMOND, and a small part of the adjoining southwestern CALVERT HILLS.|06/FEB/12
37729|Crow Formation|Thickness range|Up to 2500 m. This is a gross estimate, because outcrop is poor and measurable dips are rare. There are also structural complications.|06/FEB/12
37729|Crow Formation|Lithology|Interbedded siltstone, sandstone, shale and lesser conglomerate, which can be divided into several facies. Shelf facies is present throughout the outcrop belt and comprises shaly to flaggy white clayey micaceous siltstone and fine- to medium-grained quartzose to sublithic (+/-micaceous) sandstone, red/brown to grey shale and leached chalky white or maroon mottled porcelanous claystone. Shale is interpreted to have a carbonaceous and/or pyritic component, based on the presence of mottled ferruginous and saprolitic weathering products, but this has not been demonstrated in outcrop or drilling. Bedding ranges from massive to parallel-laminated to `tempestite textured, including wavy and lenticular bedding, hummocky cross-stratification, flute moulds, tool marks and current lineation.   Debris flow and sandstone turbidite facies is recognised almost only in the Canyon Range area and is composed of mottled white to brown, poorly-sorted, feldspathic, micaceous, ferruginous and lithic, medium- to very coarse-grained sandstone, pebbly sandstone and lesser matrix-supported polymict conglomerate. These constitute decimetre-scale beds that are massive or crudely parallel- or cross-laminated, graded or upward-graded with typical turbidite features. Shallow water sandstone facies occurs as discrete localised units within the Crow Formation, one of which is mapped informally (Psos). It entails a number of different but overlapping facies, most commonly white to maroon, fine- to very coarse-grained quartzose to lithic sandstone with locally abundant rounded pebbles and localised poorly-sorted pebble-cobble polymict conglomerate. Sandstone is locally ferruginous, micaceous and glauconitic. Bedding is medium to very thick with planar and trough cross-beds of various dimensions, planar bedding, current lineation, mudclasts, synaeresis cracks and hummocky cross-stratification.|06/FEB/12
37729|Crow Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Lies conformably on Bowgan Sandstone in the Canyon Range area, on the northwest side of the Benmara Fault. The base of the formation is poorly exposed and is locally covered by saprolite. Locally, Bowgan Sandstone is absent and Crow Formation sits directly on Benmara Group and Murphy Metamorphics (eg around 705000E 8008000N). South and east of Benmara Fault, the Crow Formation conformably overlies Playford Sandstone. In the Canyon and Mittiebah Ranges, the Crow Formation is conformably or disconformably overlain by Mittiebah Sandstone. Elsewhere, it is disconformably or unconformably overlain by Constance Sandstone. The Crow Formation pinches out immediately west of Mitchiebo Waterhole and along strike to the east near No Mans Creek (755000E 7944000N), due to erosion, depositional onlap and/or faulting. Parent Unit: Crow Formation is part of the Wild Cow Subgroup, South Nicholson Group.|06/FEB/12
37729|Crow Formation|Age reasons|Radiometric dating is currently unavailable for any part of the South Nicholson Group and its age is therefore internally unconstrained. The maximum age of 1595+/-6 Ma is that of the Lawn Hill Formation at the top of the underlying McNamara Group (Page and Sweet 1998). There are no minimum age constraints imposed by overlying units, apart from the late Neoproterozoic to Phanerozoic Georgina Basin. The interpreted age range of the Crow Formation of 1500 to 1400 Ma is based on correlation with the Roper Group of the southern McArthur Basin, which combined, make up the Roper superbasin (Jackson et al 1999, Abbott et al 2001).|06/FEB/12
37729|Crow Formation|Correlations|Tentatively, equivalent to part of the Mainoru Formation, Roper Group.|06/FEB/12

37729|Crow Formation|Comments|Reference areas: Area 1: recessive outcrop at latitude 18o39'S longitude 137o6'E (721500E 7937800N) along a small creek that feeds into Mitchiebo Waterhole in MOUNT DRUMMOND. This is adjacent to the Mittiebah-Wangalinji road and reasonably easy to access. However, it only covers a small portion of the sequence and is not fully representative of the formation. It conformably overlies Playford Sandstone and is in turn unconformably overlain by Constance Sandstone. Area 2: narrow strike ridge at latitude 18o30'S longitude 137o7'E (724000E 7952100N) 15 km north of Mitchiebo Waterhole in MOUNT DRUMMOND, containing the unnamed sandstone unit Psos.

21611|Dalumbu Sandstone|Type section locality|Lower boundary stratotype: Bluff Hill area (lat. 13o 59'S, long. 136o 44'E; GR PE877535), where the unit overlies Bartalumba Basalt. Approximately 80m of sandstone above the boundary. Reference area: Because of very gentle dips no single section through the formation exists. The nominated reference area comprises the main body of continuous outcrop of the unit on Groote Eylandt, an area of approximately 900km2, centred at about lat. 14o 05'S, long. 136o 35'E.|
21611|Dalumbu Sandstone|Extent|Most outcrops on central and southern parts of Groote Eylandt. Also exposed on Connexion Island and southeastern Bickerton Island (PORT LANGDON, CAPE BEATRICE, BLUE MUD BAY and ROPER RIVER).|
21611|Dalumbu Sandstone|Thickness range|Minimum thickness of ~500-1000m exposed on Groote Eylandt. No stratigraphic top has been recognised.|
21611|Dalumbu Sandstone|Lithology|White to pink, medium- to coarse-grained, quartz-rich, pebbly (mainly quartz) sandstones with granule lensesl very weathered, ferriginous basalt lava.|
21611|Dalumbu Sandstone|Depositional environment|Predominantly a braided fluviatile environment. Sand ridges preserved by a thin (<15m) basalt flow probably represent deposition on a shallow shelf during a brief marine incursion across a coastal plain.|
21611|Dalumbu Sandstone|Relationships and boundaries|Concordantly overlies Bartalumba Basalt, although contact is not exposed. The top of the unit is eroded and overlain unconformably by Cretaceous and Cainozoic rocks and sediments. Based on aeromagnetic evidence, it is intruded by magnetic (probably mafic) dykes.|
21611|Dalumbu Sandstone|Age reasons|Probably Statherian (Palaeoproterozoic). The Bickerton Rhyolite, low in the Groote Eylandt Group, has been dated by SHRIMP single-zircon U-Pb techniques at ~1815Ma (Pietsch et al. 1994).|
21611|Dalumbu Sandstone|Correlations|May correlate with the Sly Creek Sandstone of the Tawallah Group.|

21653|Dhalinybuy Granite|Name source|Dhalinybuy outstation (AMG PG500270), Arnhem Bay 1:250 000 scale map sheet area.|
21653|Dhalinybuy Granite|Unit history|Outcrops now mapped as this unit were previously not differentiataed from the "Spencer Creek Volcanics" by Dunnet (1965).|
21653|Dhalinybuy Granite|Geomorphic expression|The main outcrops comprise rounded weathered tors and boulders, surrounded by low scrub.|
21653|Dhalinybuy Granite|Type section locality|A type area is assigned to entire outcrop, centred on latitude 12o17'15"S, longitude 136o26'30"E (AMG PG568412).|
21653|Dhalinybuy Granite|Extent|Small area on the eastern margin of Arnhem Bay 1:250 000 scale map sheet area; specifically area 15 km northeast of Dhalinybuy outstation along small tributary creeks to Cato River.|
21653|Dhalinybuy Granite|Lithology|Massive to foliated, pink to green, medium- to coarse-grained, equigranular to porphyritic, quartz-K-feldspar-biotite granite. Plagioclase and garnet are minor localised components. Localised mylonite lenses.|
21653|Dhalinybuy Granite|Relationships and boundaries|It is inferred to intrude the Bradshaw Complex, and is overlain unconformably by the Yanungbi Volcanics and Gove Sandstone of the Spencer Creek Group. The contact with the Yanungbi Volcanics is notable for a relatively resistant linear ridge, comprised of banded and autobrecciated rhyolite adjacent to coarse-grained granite. Neither rock-type shows evidence of recrystallisation or metamorphism. This is interpreted as the base of a flow unit, sitting immediately above the granite with unconformity. Where the Yanungbi Volcanics is absent, the Dhalinybuy Grnaite is unconformably overlain by lithic sandstones of the Gove Sandstone.|
21653|Dhalinybuy Granite|Age reasons|Palaeoproterozoic (Statherian). The maximum inferred age is that of the Bradshaw Complex, which it is thought to intrude. Minimum age constraint is the inferred age of the Yanungbi Volcanics, which are interpreted to be a comagmatic equivalent of the Latram Granite of ~1710 Ma (Rawlings and othes, in prep.). Also overlain by the Cato Volcanics of similar age.|
21653|Dhalinybuy Granite|Correlations|Probably comagmatic with the Giddy and Bukudal Granites, which may in fact connect at depth.|

21654|Dhunganda Formation|Name source|Dhunganda outstation (AMG NF360753), Arnhem Bay 1 |
21654|Dhunganda Formation|Unit history|Comprises the lower half of the "Ritarango beds" of Dunnet (1965) and Plumb and Roberts (1992).|
21654|Dhunganda Formation|Geomorphic expression|Sandstone-dominated parts of the formation form resistant and upstanding ridges, while the igneous-mudstone-volcaniclastic association is typically recessive.|
21654|Dhunganda Formation|Type section locality|The southwestern perimeter of Ritarango Gap, around latitude 12o58'S, longitude 135o32'E (Arnhem Bay mapsheet area). The base of the section is AMG NF560680 and the top is NF581663. Absolute base and top of sequence are not exposed, so no boundary stratotypes are indicated.|
21654|Dhunganda Formation|Extent|Small area bordering on southern Arnhem Bay and northern Blue Mud Bay 1:250 000 scale mapsheet areas. Along with the Ritarango Formation, comprises the core of the Mitchell Range, centred on Ritarango Gap.|
21654|Dhunganda Formation|Thickness range|>500 m.|
21654|Dhunganda Formation|Lithology|Strongly deformed white fine- to coarse-grained quartzose sandstone and minor conglomeratic lithic sandstone, felsic and mafic igneous and associated volcaniclastic rocks, and mudstones. Sandstones are silicified, medium- to very thick-bedded, trough cross-bedded or rarely rippled. Conglomeratic sandstone is common near the base and contains pebbles and cobbles of massive quartz and lesser quartzite and felsic igneous rock. Felsic igneous rock is porphyritic K-feldspar-quartz-albite rhyolite, grading locally into dolerite and hybrid rock. Volcaniclastic rocks include primary and redeposited hyaloclastite and autoclastite breccia, and epiclastic sandstone and mudstone. Localised coarsening-upward cycles of mudstone and fine- to medium-grained sandstone, with common ripples and mudclasts and lesser hummocky cross-beds and tool marks. All rock-types are commonly sheared.|
21654|Dhunganda Formation|Depositional environment|Lower part of sequence: high-energy, shallow water, fluviatile to deltaic sedimentary rocks. Upper part of sequence: volcanic and intrusive igneous rocks; moderately deep water to emergent sedimentary rocks.|
21654|Dhunganda Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Basal formation of the Donydji Group. Apparently unconformably overlies the Mirarrmina Complex and is in turn unconformably? overlain by the Ritarango Formation. The lower contact is not exposed, but likely basal coarse-grained conglomeratic lithic sandstones of the Dhunganda Formation lie adjacent to granitic and metamorphic rocks of the Mirarrmina Complex at NF587912 and NF600858, with no evidence of a fault. The upper contact was not observed, but corresponds to a significant change in rock-types and structural characteristics, possibly related to a sedimentological break and period of tectonism. The Ritarango Formation comprises considerably coarser-grained and less-mature siliciclastic rocks with an apparently lower degree of deformation. The underlying Dhunganda Formation is made up of strongly-deformed interlayered sandstone, mudstone, volcaniclastic and bimodal igneous rocks. In most places this boundary has been intruded by a large mafic sill, obscuring the contact.|
21654|Dhunganda Formation|Age reasons|Palaeoproterozoic (Statherian). The maximum age is poorly constrained by an inferred age of ~1870 Ma for the underlying Mirarrmina Complex (based on correlation with Bradshw Complex in eastern Arnhem Bay/western Gove mapsheet areas; Plumb and Roberts, 1992). Its minimum age is constrained by ~1710 Ma age determinations for concordant igneous units at the top of the Donydji Group (Rawlings and others, in prep.). Most likely correlation according to Rawlings (1994) is with lower Tawallah Group, suggesting the best estimate of this formations age is ~1800 Ma or slightly younger.|
21654|Dhunganda Formation|Correlations|Rawlings and others (in prep.) and Rawlings (1994) suggest correlation with the lower parts of the Tawallah and Katherine River Groups in the southern and western parts of the McArthur Basin respectively. Similarly, it may well correlate with the Alyangula Subgroup of the Groote Eylandt Group. These correlations are based on geochemical, petrological, lithostatigraphic and geochronological constraints, and the physical form of igneous units.|
21654|Dhunganda Formation|Proposed publication|Arnhem Bay-Gove 1:250 000 Geological Map Series, Northern Territory, National Geoscience Mapping Accord, Explanatory Notes (Rawlings and others, in prep.).|
21654|Dhunganda Formation|Comments|The "Ritarango beds" of Dunnet (1965) and Plumb and Roberts (1965, 1992) were inadequately defined with no type section. The reference locality nominated was too broad to be useful. The need to subdivide them was brought about by the identification of significant mid-sequence changes in rock-type and structural characteristics, thought to be related to a significant sedimentological break and period of tectonism (unconformity). Most of the areas previously mapped as Ritarango beds are now mapped as Ritarango Formation, and a small mappable area of distinctly different (older) outcrop has been extracted and mapped as Dhunganda Formation.|

21655|Dhupuwamirri Member|Name source|Dhupuwamirri Creek, a west-flowing fresh-water tributary of the Gulbuwangay River. The upper reaches of this creek cross-cut the member near AMG NF630900, at the northern tip of the Mitchell Range, Arnhem Bay 1:250 000 scale mapsheet area. Dhupuwamirri outstation (NF430995) lies to the south on Radalngarrmirri Creek.|
21655|Dhupuwamirri Member|Unit history|Previously undifferentiated Fagan Volcanics. Equates roughly to the informal "members C and D" of Plumb and Roberts (1992).|
21655|Dhupuwamirri Member|Geomorphic expression|Igneous units form recessive valleys adjacent to the more resistant ridges of the sedimentary units. Outcrop areas are typically highly vegetated.|
21655|Dhupuwamirri Member|Type section locality|In Blue Mud Bay, outcrop in high-relief areas has been deeply incised by tributaries of the Koolatong River and many complete sections exist. Unfortunately, these are difficult to access without a helicopter. The type section follows the upper part of the river near latitude 13o30', longitude 135o30' between the lower boundary stratotype at NF550540 and the top boundary stratotype at NF540490. It comprises relatively abundant intrusive and hybrid rocks. Reference localities: Reference locality 1: A creek section at about NF580470 (Blue Mud Bay), which comprises a more diverse sedimentary-dominated succession than the type section. Reference locality 2: Easily accessible, but incomplete, outcrop adjacent to the Gove-Bulman road near NF600880 (Arnhem Bay) is representative of the local volcanic rocks.|
21655|Dhupuwamirri Member|Extent|Outcrop occurs in two distinct areas in the northern and southern parts of the Mitchell Range, in both Arnhem Bay and Blue Mud Bay 1:250 000 scale mapsheet areas. The areas are separated by a considerable distance (~30 km).|
21655|Dhupuwamirri Member|Thickness range|300-550 m|
21655|Dhupuwamirri Member|Lithology|Sheet-like bodies of undeformed to mildly deformed porphyritic K-feldspar-quartz-albite rhyolite, locally associated with mafic igneous and hybrid rocks, and volcaniclastic and sedimentary rocks. Felsic igneous bodies are locally flow-banded and autoclastic and are sometimes associated with peripheral peperite breccia. Sedimentary units comprise white to maroon, fine- to medium-grained, thin- to thick-bedded, lithic sandstone, interbedded with massive to poorly-bedded, red-brown, micaceous and sandy mudstone. Sandstones are trough cross-bedded or rippled with locally common mudclasts. Bedded mudstones are rippled, wavy bedded, with shrinkage cracks and synsedimentary deformation structures. Volcaniclastic rocks include hyaloclastite and autoclastite breccia. All rock-types are locally sheared.|
21655|Dhupuwamirri Member|Depositional environment|Sedimentary facies: shallow-water, low- to moderate-energy setting, perhaps fan-delta to fluvial. Igneous rocks: interpreted as flows and shallow sillts.|
21655|Dhupuwamirri Member|Relationships and boundaries|Lies conformably between the sandstone-mudstone sequence of the Sheridan Member and the quartzose sandstones of the Parsons Range Group (Mattamurta Sandstone). A peperitic breccia is locally developed at the base of the lower felsic igneous unit of this member. In the southern part of the Mitchell Range, the upper contact is generally very sharp and is interpreted as a sequence (chronostratigraphic) boundary. The rock-type directly underlying the uniform medium-grained quartzose Mattamurta Sandstone varies considerably along strike, to include red-brown mudstone, lithic sandstone and igneous rocks. This variation is interpreted to be related to rapid lateral transitions in sedimentary facies, probably in response to emplacement of intrusive igneous bodies in the subsurface. Unfortunately, discontinuous outcrop does not allow this boundary to be traced into the northern part of the Mitchell Range where a similar type of boundary is not readily discernable. A lithostratigraphic boundary is mapped there, dividing igneous rock (Dhupuwamirri Member) from mudstone or sandstone (Mattamurta Sandstone). This boundary potentially occupies a marginally different chronostratigraphic position to the boundary in the south.|
21655|Dhupuwamirri Member|Age reasons|Palaeoproterozoic (Statherian). Well constrained by single grain SHRIMP U-Pb geochronological techniques at ~1710 Ma (Rawlings and others, in prep.). The rhyolite porphyry sample used was collected from outcrop at NF544516.|
21655|Dhupuwamirri Member|Correlations|Rawlings and others (in prep.) and Rawlings (1994) suggest correlation with the upper parts of the Tawallah and Katherine River Groups in the southern and western McArthur Basin respectively. More locally, it correlates to felsic igneous successions of the Spencer Creek Group in northeastern Arnhem Bay and tentatively with the Gadabara Volcanics in the eastern Blue Mud Bay mapsheet area. These correlations are based on geochemical, petrological, lithostratigraphic and geochronological constraints, and the physical form of igneous units.|

30418|Diamond Creek Volcanics|Name source|From Diamond Creek, in KATHERINE, which intersects the volcanic rocks around lat. 14o17?S, long. 133o04'E.|
30418|Diamond Creek Volcanics|Unit history|The name Diamond Creek Member was introduced without formal definition by Ruker (1959) to describe a sequence of dolostone, sandstone, conglomerate and basic volcanics in WATERHOUSE - one of three members in the Kombolgie Formation. Randal (1963) introduced the Diljin Hill Formation to encompass the sequence overlying the Kombolgie Formation, and included the Diamond Creek Member in the Diljin Hill Formation. Walpole and others (1968) abandoned the Diljin Hill Formation and raised all three members within it to formation status. The oldest of these, the Diamond Creek Formation, was equated with the Cottee Formation, Shadforth Sandstone and McCaw Formation of Roberts & Plumb (1965) in MOUNT MARUMBA. Furthermore, it consists of two distinct units: a lower unit of dolostone, sandstone, conglomerate and probable fine-grained siliciclastic rocks directly comparable to the McCaw Formation, and an upper unit of vesicular basic lavas and associated pyroclastic rocks. The lower unit is here mapped as McCaw Formation, and the upper unit formally defined as Diamond Creek Volcanics. This is a more restricted use of the term than Ruker?s (1959) original conception.|
30418|Diamond Creek Volcanics|Geomorphic expression|Recessive; poorly exposed, in valleys.|
30418|Diamond Creek Volcanics|Type section locality|Adjacent to West Branch (Creek); base at lat. 14o11.4'S, long. 133o10.6'E (GR LE039304), top about 1 km southeast at lat. 14o11.5'S, long. 133o11.1'E (GR LE044299). The outcrop belt extending northeastward for 5 km from the type section contains the best exposures of the unit and is a reference area.|
30418|Diamond Creek Volcanics|Extent|Waterhouse Syncline in northeastern KATHERINE and in adjacent parts of URAPUNGA.|
30418|Diamond Creek Volcanics|Thickness range|230 m in type section; 100 m near Waterhouse Falls (lat. 14o27.5'S, long. 133o8'E); absent in southwestern WATERHOUSE 1:100 000 sheet area.|
30418|Diamond Creek Volcanics|Lithology|Vesicular and amygdaloidal basic lavas (some autobrecciated) dominate. Tuff, fine- to coarse-grained volcaniclastic sandstone and coarse-grained lithic sandstone form minor intercalations. The lava, tuff and/or volcaniclastic sandstone locally also occur in breccia. The rocks are pervasively altered and weathered, and due to the relatively high contents of hematite (and limonite), colours range mostly between brick red, brown-red, red-brown and brown-grey. Original composition of the volcanic rocks is thought to range from andesite to basalt.|
30418|Diamond Creek Volcanics|Depositional environment|Terrestrial to subaqueous environments.|
30418|Diamond Creek Volcanics|Relationships and boundaries|Base of formation is at base of lowest volcanic rock (generally vesicular lava) above conglomerate and sandstone of the McCaw Formation. Outcrop is poor, the contact is rarely exposed, and the boundary is therefore generally drawn from aerial photographs, corresponding to a change to a more uniform, darker photopattern and colour. The contact is concordant and probably conformable. The top of the formation is at change from basic volcanics to sandstone of the Gundi Sandstone. The contact is sharp and probably unconformable, and the Gundi Sandstone locally rests directly on Kombolgie Formation.|
30418|Diamond Creek Volcanics|Age reasons|Statherian Period of Palaeoproterozoic. The age is constrained only by the 1830 Ma age for parts of the underlying Edith River Group, and by the 1710 Ma age for the overlying West Branch Volcanics. The actual age is likely to be much closer to that of the West Branch Volcanics, as Diamond Creek volcanism appears to be an early phase of the activity which culminated in extrusion of the West Branch Volcanics.|
30418|Diamond Creek Volcanics|Correlations|Upper Tawallah Group in central McArthur Basin, in part, particularly the Settlement Creek/Gold Creek Volcanics.|

21680|Donydji Group|Unit history|The formations which now collectively make up the Donydji Group were informally referred to by Crohn (1956) as the "Mitchell Range" and "Cypress Creek Formations". This package of stratigraphy was later revised by Dunnet (1965) to include two new subdivisions, the "Ritarango beds" and Fagan Volcanics. These were subsequently formalised by Plumb and Roberts (1992).|

21680|Donydji Group|Lithology|Strongly to mildly deformed lithic to quartzose sandstone and conglomeratic sandstone, felsic and mafic igneous rocks, volcaniclastic rocks, and mudstone.|
21680|Donydji Group|Depositional environment|Ranges from fluviatile to shallow- and moderate-depth water for the sedimentary facies; igneous rocks are volcanic and intrusive.|
21680|Donydji Group|Relationships and boundaries|Probably unconformably overlies the metamorphic and granitic rocks of the Mirarrmina Complex and is in turn conformably overlain by the arenaceous rocks of the Parsons Range Group.|
21680|Donydji Group|Age reasons|Palaeoproterozoic (Statherian). The maximum age is poorly constrained by an inferred age of ~1870 Ma for the underlying Mirarrmina Complex (based on correlation with Bradshaw Complex in eastern Arnhem Bay/western Gove mapsheet areas; Plumb and Roberts, 1992). Most likely correlation of the basal part of the sequence according to Rawlings (1994) is with the lower Tawallah Group (see correlatives), suggesting the maximum age is ~1800 Ma or slightly younger. The minimum age of the Donydji Group is well constrained by ~1710 Ma ages for concordant igneous units at the top of the group (Maidjunga and Dhupuwamirri Members of the Fagan Volcanics; Rawlings and others, in prep.).|
21680|Donydji Group|Correlations|Rawlings (1994) first attempted regional correlation of the Donydji Group based on geochemical, petrological, lithostratigraphic and geochronological constraints, and the physical form of igneous units. The Donydji Group as an entity equates stratigraphically to parts of the Tawallah and Katherine River Groups in the southern and western parts of the McArthur Basin respectively. The upper part (Fagan Volcanics) correlates with the Spencer Creek Group in northwestern Gove 1:250 000 mapsheet area and tentatively with the Gadabara Volcanics in eastern Blue Mud Bay. Conversely, the lower part (Dhunganda Formation) may well correlate with the upper Groote Eylandt Group, depending on the difference in age between the Dhunganda and Ritarango Formations and Fagan Volcanics.|

21680|Donydji Group|Comments|The Donydji Group is readily distinguishable from the Mirarrmina Complex below and Parsons Range Group above. It has a distinctive association of igneous and sedimentary rocks and structural characteristics which enables it to be differentiated as an entity. Similarly, there is enough internal variation to warrant subdivision into the component formations. The lower two formations are apparently divided by a significant structural and sedimentological break, but are contiguous with the overall tectonic evolutionary trend. This break is thought to have local significance but is subtle in a regional sense.|

21715|Durabudboi beds|Unit history|None. Dunnet (1965) did not previously differentiate this unit from surrounding Cretaceous and Cainozoic deposits.|
21715|Durabudboi beds|Geomorphic expression|Very low rises and dissected country beneath laterite break-aways.|
21715|Durabudboi beds|Type section locality|Reference locality: Small roadside quarry, and low hill immediately behind, on the main Nhulunbuy road 25 km east of the Gapuwiyak turn-off (latitude 12o45'S, longitude 136o01'E; AMG PF102900).|
21715|Durabudboi beds|Extent|Central Arnhem Bay-Gove 1:250 000 scale map sheet area, near headwaters of  Durabudboi River.|
21715|Durabudboi beds|Thickness range|Unknown as no stratigraphic base or top is exposed. Individual outcrops only display a few metres of section.|
21715|Durabudboi beds|Lithology|Weathered and ferruginised mudstone, which was probably originally dolomitic. On the surface it is commonly dark red due to the ferruginisation, but when exposed in creek beds may be purple, white or yellow. Bedding is thin and flaggy, and the rock is finely laminated. Minor chert is also present. At the reference locality the main lithology is finely laminated, yellowish, blocky mudstone, with the appearance of having originally been dolomitic. On the hill behind the quarry, rubble of leached and silicified carbonates include relic intraclastic, arenitic, stromatolitic and evaporitic fabrics.|
21715|Durabudboi beds|Relationships and boundaries|No contacts with other units seen. Regional structural interpretations suggest that these beds lie beneath the Roper Group, but this cannot be confirmed with complete confidence.|
21715|Durabudboi beds|Age reasons|Uncertain, but probably late Palaeoproterozoic or early Mesoproterozoic.|
21715|Durabudboi beds|Correlations|There are a number of potential correlatives including fine grained units in the Balma, Habgood, and Nathen Groups and the Jalma Formation. Alternatively the beds may correlate with units within the Roper Group, but this is considered unlikely.|

26534|Elcho Island Formation|Type section locality|Plumb and Roberts (1992) only nominated a reference area (see below) and no boundary stratotypes. Lower boundary stratotype at AMG NG043313 (latitude 12o18'S, longitude 135o02'20"E), a sharp slightly erosive contact between white, medium-grained quartz-rich sandstone of the Marchinbar Sandstone below, and friable fine-grained, red-brown, flaggy sandstone of the Elcho Island Formation. Top stratotype at AMG NG223477 (latitude 12o14'S, longitude 135o12'20" E) on Banyan Island, considered to be approximately the top-most exposed beds of the formation. The actual contact with the Jigaimara Formation is not exposed, but the Jigaimara Formation outcrops to the west along ther same coast at a stratigraphically slightly higher position. There are no sections through the Elcho Island Formation, the type locality here nominated as the scattered outcrops between the boundary stratotypes (23 km apart and somewhat oblique to the outcrop trend). The sequence is considered to be uniformly dipping gently (average about 3o) north in this area.  Reference locality: As nominated by Plumb and Roberts (1992), the cliffs near Galiwinku (AMG NG615700) on Elcho Island, however other isolated outcrops on Elcho Island are now excluded. This is the most continuous outcrop of the unit, but is not considered representative of the entire formation.|03/DEC/12

26534|Elcho Island Formation|Depositional environment|Shallow marine. Local evidence of evaporitic conditions and exposure.|03/DEC/12
26534|Elcho Island Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Overlies the Marchinbar Sandstone. Boundary picked where white, medium-grained, quartz-rich sandstone is succeeded by flaggy, brown, fine-grained sandstones and mudstones. The boundary seems to be regionally concordant, but at the only location where it is well exposed (lower boundary stratotype) it is slightly erosive and is possibly a sequence boundary. Overlain by the Middle Cambrian Jigaimara Formation with probable disconformity or unconformity. Boundary not exposed, but picked below fossiliferous chert and silicified calcareous siltstone. Top exposed beds of the Elcho Island Formation are sandstones. Overlain unconformably by Cretaceous and Cainozoic deposits.|03/DEC/12
26534|Elcho Island Formation|Age reasons|No fossils have been found. Units lower in the group contain Neoproterozoic fossils (Rawlings and others, in prep.), while the overlying (probably disconformable or unconformable) Jigaimara Formation is Middle Cambrian (Plumb and others, 1976).

25892|Elkedra Granite|Extent|Confined to an area of about 12 km2 in SE corner of Elkedra and SW corner of George Creek 1:100 000 Sheet areas, Elkedra 1:250 000 Sheet area.|
25892|Elkedra Granite|Lithology|Pale pink, medium to coarse, even-grained to slightly megacrystic, homogeneous leucogranite; minor medium-grained tourmaline granite, greisen, aplite, quartz+feldspar+/-tourmaline pegmatite, and quartz-tourmaline veins. The leucogranite consists of about equal amounts of quartz (variably strained), subhedral oligoclase, and perthitic microcline, and up to 10% muscovite and subordinate biotite (partly altered to chlorite).|
25892|Elkedra Granite|Relationships and boundaries|Intrudes the Rooneys Formation of the Ooradidgee Subgroup of the Hatches Creek Group and a granophyre sill, and has a metamorphic aureole about 100 m wide; is cut by quartz veins and overlain by flat-lying Cambrian strata (Sandover beds).

6073|Elkera Formation|Thickness range|220 m in the type section, 70 m in the SE Elyuah Range where the upper part of the formation has apparently been lost by erosion during the earliest Cambrian, 80-240 m elsewhere. Thickness variations seem mostly to be due to the level of sub-Cambrian erosion.|15/AUG/06
6073|Elkera Formation|Lithology|Interbedded siltstone, dolomite, sandstone and shale. The siltstone where fresh is green-grey, red-brown, and a very distinctive blue-grey to blue-green colour. The lower dolomites are medium to dark-brown, yellow or grey, and frequently contain poorly preserved columnar branching stromatolites. The upper dolomite is yellow-brown to pink, laminated and oolitic and contains the columnar stromatolite Georgina howchini Walter. The sandstone is light grey to red-brown and locally is identical to that in the underlying Grant Bluff Formation. The section identified as Elkera Formation in drill hole DDC 1 (cores stored by NT Geological Survey, Alice Springs) near Mt Skinner contains anhydrite, dolomite nodules after anhydrite, and carbonate pseudomorphs after gypsum; this facies has not been recognised in outcrop.|
6073|Elkera Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The lower boundary is placed at the top of the ridge-forming sandstones of the Grant Bluff Formation (Walter, 1979). This is considered to be conformable. The upper boundary in the Huckitta 1:250 000 Sheet area is placed at the base of green and grey siltstone and sandstone at the base of the Mt Baldwin Formation (as redefined here) or, in the Mopunga Range, at the base of the archaeocyathan-bearing carbonates. In DDC 1 from near Mt Skinner the top is placed at the top of the highest prominant carbonate bed. The upper boundary is a disconformity in the Huckitta Sheet area but is conformable at Mt Skinner.|

The lower member, the Oorabra Arkose, has been upgraded to a formation because an unconformity has been recognised between the two former members (Walter, 1979). The name Elyuah Formation is here restricted to the former upper, shale and siltstone, member (which was not originally separately named). The original type section of Smith (1964), X23, is retained. There the formation as now defined has a thickness of 36 m. Smith's (1964) definition of the top of the formation is retained. The base is taken at the base of a thin but persistent sandstone or pebbly arkose underlying the shale and siltstone of which the formation is mostly composed.|

24269|Enbra Granulite|Type section locality|From Snake Well (GR 5651-856356) to a prominent hill 3 km to the south.|
24269|Enbra Granulite|Extent|The unit is well exposed in an area of low hills immediately south of Snake Well in Burt 1:100 000 Sheet area.|
24269|Enbra Granulite|Lithology|Dominantly mafic granulite but includes a small amount of felsic granulite. The mafic granulite is very homogeneous and consists of hypersthene, plagioclase, and hornblende.|
24269|Enbra Granulite|Relationships and boundaries|Separated from the Erontonga metamorphics and the Sliding Rock metamorphics by Cainozoic cover sediments. However, magnetic data indicate that the unit is faulted against both of these bounding formations.|
24269|Enbra Granulite|Age reasons|Middle Proterozoic or older. The unit is considered to be a basal member of the Strangways Metamorphic Complex, and as such was probably metamorphosed at 1800 m.y. (Black, 1975).|

27287|Epenarra Volcanics|Relationships and boundaries|Unconformable on the Warramunga Group, intrusive feldspar porphyry unnamed leucogranite. Overlain conformably by, and locally interfingers with, thinly bedded greywacke and siltstone of the Rooneys Formation, basaltic lavas of the Edmirringee Volcanics, pale buff or grey feldspathic/lithic quartz arenite of the Kurinelli Sandstone, and white or pale pink quartzose arenite of the Unimbra Sandstone. Arenites of the Epenarra Volcanics are distinguished from those of adjacent formations by purplish or reddish-brown colour and volcaniclastic content. The formation is intruded by granophyre, microgranite, and dolerite, and is overlain unconformably by Cambrian and younger beds.|
27287|Epenarra Volcanics|Age reasons|Younger than 1870 m.y. - U-Pb zircon age for volcanics in the Warramunga Group unconformably underlying the Hatches Creek Group. Older than 1640 m.y. - Rb-Sr whole-rock approximate age for granite intruding the Hatches Creek Group.|

34086|Fairy Glen Sandstone Member|Unit history|The Fairy Glen Sandstone Member was not distinguished during previous mapping of the Parsons Range Group by Plumb & Roberts (1992), but was described in measured sections as an interval of ferruginous (hematitic) sandstone|
34086|Fairy Glen Sandstone Member|Geomorphic expression|Forms a distinctive dark reddish-brown-coloured capping on a south- to east-dipping cuesta.|
34086|Fairy Glen Sandstone Member|Type section locality|Sixteen kilometres northeast of Fairy Glen, the base is at lat. 13o18'20"S, long. 135o29'51.55"E; the top is at lat. 13o18'27"S, long. 135o29'54.88"E.|

34086|Fairy Glen Sandstone Member|Lithology|Medium-grained, swaley and hummocky cross-stratified medium-grained ferruginous sandstone; very fine- to fine-grained, slightly ferruginous, lithic, and clay-rich sandstones more common in central and southern Parsons Range outcrops.|
34086|Fairy Glen Sandstone Member|Depositional environment|Shallow marine; probably lower to mid-shoreface, based on domination by swaley and hummocky cross-stratified sands.|
34086|Fairy Glen Sandstone Member|Relationships and boundaries|Member of the Badalngarrmirri Formation, Parsons Range Group. Both lower and upper contacts, although relatively sharp, are believed to be conformable. Base is placed at the change from medium-grained quartz arenite (of informal unit 10a), to ferruginous, porous sandstone. The top is marked by an abrupt change of slope, coinciding with the change from ferruginous sandstone to laminated mudstone, the latter rarely exposed.|
34086|Fairy Glen Sandstone Member|Age reasons|Palaeoproterozoic: maximum age is well constrained by the age of the uppermost formation of the Donydji Group, the Fagan Volcanics, at 1710 Ma; minimum age is less well constrained, but must be greater than 1620 Ma, the age of the Yarrawirrie Formation in the overlying Balma Group (Pietsch and others, 1994), and most likely older than 1640 Ma, the age of the Barney Creek Formation (Page & Sweet, in press), a correlative of the central Balma Group (Haines, 1994).|

24275|Fenton Granite|Lithology|Three phases are recognised. Pgfa is a megacrystic foliated biotite-hornblende granite containing tabular perthitic microcline phenocrysts in a granular mass of anhedral biotite, hornblende, quartz, microcline and plagioclase. Accessory minerals are sphene, opaque minerals, zircon and apatite and rare epidote.  Pgfb is a medium- to coarse-grained granuloblastic to slightly porphyritic biotite granite with distinctive clear quartz crystals. Equal amounts of subhedral quartz and anhedral microcline occur as phenocrysts, or as equigranular crystals in the groundmass together with minor biotite and accessory hornblende, garnet, apatite and zircon. Biotite is commonly altered to sphene or chlorite.  Pgfc is a distinctively dark-coloured biotite-hornblende granite. The texture is sub- to anhedral granular, medium- to coarse-grained, of microcline, quartz, biotite and hornblende with some larger microcline and plagioclase laths up to 4 mm across. Hornblende and biotite are commonly altered to sphene, magnetite or epidote. Accessory minerals are apatite and zircon.|

6631|Fickling Group|Name source|From Fickling Creek, a tributary of the Nicholson River in the southeastern part of the Nicholson River 1:100 000 Sheet area, Northern Territory (Sheet 6362).|
6631|Fickling Group|Name source|That the Fickling Group now be extended to included the Fish River Formation. Former definition: The Fickling Group previously included only the Walford Dolomite, Mount Les Siltstone and Doomadgee Formation. Reasons for inclusion of Fish River Formation: The Fish River Formation, which unconformably overlies the Peters Creek Volcanics, marks the beginning of a major new cycle of sedimentation in the Westmoreland region of Queensland and adjacent parts of the Northern Territory. It is overlain conformably by the Walford Dolomite, which represents the beginning of widespread carbonate sedimentation after the initial clastic episode during transgression. The Fish River Formation had previously been excluded from the Fickling Group because it is not dolomitic. However, mapping of equivalent sequences in the Lawn Hill and Mount Isa areas show the same pattern of clastic, followed by dolomitic, sedimentation: ie, it is obviously a widespread sedimentation pattern, and the Fish River Formation is a part of it.|21/SEP/06

6679|Fish Billabong Adamellite|Relationships and boundaries|Intrudes the Early Proterozoic Hermit Creek Metamorphics and Early Proterozoic Burrell Creek Formation (no contact exposed). Unconformably overlain by Early Cambrian sedimentary rocks and Antrim Plateau Volcanics.|
6679|Fish Billabong Adamellite|Age reasons|Early Proterozoic. Undated, however the non-foliated texture and relationships (below) indicate that it is a probable late- to post-orogenic* intrusive, similar to others found in the Pine Creek Geosyncline and the Litchfield Block areas. (*1870 Ma - 1800 Ma orogeny in the Pine Creek Geosyncline (Needham and others, 1980).|

6682|Fish River Formation|Name source|From Fish River, a south-flowing tributary of the Nicholson River in the southern Seigal Sheet area.|
6682|Fish River Formation|Type section locality|Roberts et (1963) nominated a reference section in the Seigal Sheet area, but since this has not been published as a type section, a complete well exposed section in and adjacent to Wire Creek in the Hedleys Creek Sheet area is nominated as the type section. The base of the section is in the east bank of Wire Creek at grid reference 957314. The section runs southeast along the creek bank for 1.3 km to a cliff, then for a distance of 0.7 km due east to the to of the formation at grid reference 974305.|
6682|Fish River Formation|Extent|The unit forms a series of disconnected ridges trending east-northeast across the southern part of the Seigal Sheet area, Northern Territory, and crops out in a belt up to 4 km wide with similar trend in the central part of the Hedleys Creek Sheet area, Queensland.|
6682|Fish River Formation|Thickness range|250 m in type section; 10-200 m in Seigal Sheet area.|
6682|Fish River Formation|Lithology|Fine to medium-grained quartz sandstone, with minor lithic sandstone, conglomeratic sandstone, siltstone and shale.  A lens of siltstone and shale (Ptf2), has been mapped in the Hedleys Creek Sheet area, and divides the lower (Ptf1) and upper (Ptf3) sandstones in the unit.|
6682|Fish River Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The contact with the underlying Peters Creek Volcanics is sharp, and is marked by a thin (1 m) conglomerate at the base of the Fish River Formation. It appears disconformable in outcrop, but on a regional scale is an angular unconformity - successively older units of the Peters Creek Volcanics are truncated the farther west one goes. The upper contact is also sharp and is recognised by an abrupt change from sandstone (with gritty lenses) to poorly outcropping shale, and silicified stromatolitic dolomite.|
6682|Fish River Formation|Identifying features|The name was first published by Roberts, Rhodes and Yates (1963) but the unit was not defined. During mapping in 1972 the unit was completely remapped and a suitable type section nominated. Although the unit is predominantly sandstone, the term "Formation" has been retained, because the name has been in use for 15 years, and is in wide use in literature. It is not entirely inaccurate anyway, because conglomerate and siltstone are both prominent rock types in the type area.|
6682|Fish River Formation|Age reasons|Proterozoic-Carpentarian. It is correlated on lithological grounds with the sandstone in the Masterton Formation in the nearby McArthur Basin (which is part of the "type" Carpentarian).|

In this section the formation is about 500 m thick, dips 50-60o north, and consists of about 50 m of generally recessive thinly bedded quartzose, feldspathic, and kaolinitic arenites and micaceous siltstone, which show ripple marks, mud-cracks, and rare halite casts, and an overlying sequence about 450 m thick of mainly carbonates - yellow, brown, and pink stromatolitic dolomite and ripple-marked dolomitic arenite, and grey limey beds.

21824|Gadabara Volcanics|Unit history|Previously undifferentiated "Bickerton Volcanics" of Plumb and Roberts (1965).|
21824|Gadabara Volcanics|Geomorphic expression|Outcrop is relatively resistant and comprises blocks, boulders and rubble.|
21824|Gadabara Volcanics|Type section locality|At the southern tip of Round Hill Island (latitude 13o19'S, longitude 136o6'E; AMG PF181269). No specific section is nominated due to lateral variation in rocktypes. Lower boundary stratotype at AMG PF173284 (Blue Mud Bay) where volcanic breccia of Gadabara Volcanics overlies migmatitic gneisses of the Bradshaw Complex. The boundary with the overlying Coast Range Sandstone is not well exposed, and a top boundary stratotype is not defined.|
21824|Gadabara Volcanics|Extent|Outcrop is confined to Round Hill Island, adjacent to Grindall Point in the northeastern part of Blue mud Bay 1:250 000 scale mapsheet area.|
21824|Gadabara Volcanics|Thickness range|Approximately 50 m at type locality.|
21824|Gadabara Volcanics|Lithology|Salmon pink, but sometimes orange or brown, altered felsic igneous rock (rhyolite?). About half of the exposure is made up of coherent pink rock, the other half by volcanic breccia. Coherent rock, which takes the form of dykes, sills and lava flows, is generally microcrystalline and aphyric to slightly porphyritic (small K-feldspar), with accessory fragments of sandstone and granite, and locally common amygdales. Abundant thin (<1 m) banded dykes intrude the Bradshaw Complex on the western side of the island (lower boundary stratotype), and the volcanic breccia on the other sides of the island. Lava flows locally exhibit contorted flow banding, which appears to dip steeply away from the centre of the island, the inferred pre-existing volcanic edifice. They also contain occasional large rafts of contorted sandstone, presumably derived from the underlying Woodah Sandstone. Volcanic breccia, which tends to underlie or is intruded by the coherent rock, ranges from fine-grained volcanic sandstone to block and boulder volcanic breccia. Clasts are almost exclusively angular- or pillow-shaped pink-orange rhyolite as described above, with a variable component of clasts derived from the basement. Mud-grade volcaniclastic material makes up the matrix. These breccias range from crudely stratified to unstratified.|
21824|Gadabara Volcanics|Depositional environment|Volcanic and shallow intrusive igneous rocks associated with probable subaqueous volcaniclastic rocks.|
21824|Gadabara Volcanics|Relationships and boundaries|Intrudes and overlies the Bradshaw Complex and Woodah Sandstone and is in turn overlain unconformably by the Coast Range Sandstone.|
21824|Gadabara Volcanics|Age reasons|Palaeoproterozoic (Statherian). Not well constrained. They appear to intrude and lie stratigraphically above the Woodah Sandstone, indicating they are probably younger than the ~1810 Ma Bickerton Rhyolite to the south (Pietsch and others, in prep.). The unconformably overlying Coast Range Sandstone is tentatively correlated with the Parsons Range Group (Haines and others, in prep.), which has a minimum age of ~1640 Ma (the age of the overlying McArthur Group in the south; Haines, 1994). They are similar to the ~1710 Ma Yanungbi Volcanics in Arnhem Bay (Rawlings and others, in prep.), and occupy a similar stratigraphic position.|
21824|Gadabara Volcanics|Correlations|Possibly the Yanungbi Volcanics (Arnhem Bay) and Fagan Volcanics (Arnhem Bay and Blue Mud Bay mapsheet areas). This is based on similar stratigraphic position and petrology (Rawlings and othes, in prep.; Rawlings, 1994).|
21824|Gadabara Volcanics|Proposed publication|Blue Mud Bay 1:250 000 Geological Map Series, Northern Territory, National Geoscience Mapping Accord, Explanatory Notes (Haines and others, in prep.).|
21824|Gadabara Volcanics|Comments|Outcrop now assigned to this formation was previously (Plumb and jDunet, 1965) mapped as "Bickerton Volcanics", formalised by Plumb and Roberts (1992). Pietsch and others (in prep.) were able to demonstrate that the various outcrops assigned to this formation are non-correlatives, and in many cases are significantly different in age. The name was subsequently abandoned by Pietsch and others (in prep.) and the various outcrops were remapped as a series of new formations, including the Gadabara Volcanics.|

34083|Gali Member|Unit history|The Gali Member was not distinguished during previous mapping of the Parsons Range Group by Plumb & Roberts (1992).|
34083|Gali Member|Geomorphic expression|Recessive relative to the quartz arenite members above and below, and therefore a narrow valley, but the upper part of the member forms rounded low hills as a result of the resistant clayey sandstone interbeds.|

34083|Gali Member|Extent|Main outcrops lie within the Parsons Range, extending from 3km south of the headwaters of Matta Murta Creek in the eastern Parsons Range, in an arcuate belt 50 km west, southwest and south, to a point about 17 km south-southeast of Mount Fawcett (Fleming 1:100 000 sheet); only other outcrops are in the valley in which Gali Oustation lies (Mirrngadja 1:100 000 sheet).|
34083|Gali Member|Thickness range|Maximum of 360 m in eastern Parsons Range, including at type section, thinning to 0 m in the southwest.|
34083|Gali Member|Lithology|Laminated to thin- and wavily-bedded, and hummocky cross-stratified mudstone and fine to coarse siltstone; interbeds of thin to medium bedded, fine-grained clayey sandstone in the upper part.|
34083|Gali Member|Depositional environment|Storm-dominated shelf: lower to upper shoreface.|
34083|Gali Member|Relationships and boundaries|A member of the Badalngarrmirri Formation, Parsons Range Group. Lower contact is marked by an abrupt change from quartz arenite below, to mudstone. It is a sharp contact, but is presumed conformable. The upper contact is probably gradational, with interfingering relationship of the clayey sandstone beds with quartz arenite. The upper boundary is placed at the first resistant medium-grained quartz arenite bed.|
34083|Gali Member|Age reasons|Palaeoproterozoic: As for the parent formation, the maximum age of the member is well constrained by the age of the uppermost formation of the Donydji Group, the Fagan Volcanics, at 1710 Ma; minimum age is less well constrained, but must be greater than 1620 Ma, the age of the Yarrawirrie Formation in the overlying Balma Group (Pietsch and others, 1994), and most likely older than 1640 Ma, the age of the Barney Creek Formation (Page & Sweet, in press), a correlative of the central Balma Group (Haines, 1994).|

37623|Geolsec Formation|Thickness range|Unknown.|
37623|Geolsec Formation|Lithology|Haematite quartzite breccia interbedded with massive haematitic sandstone, siltstone and mudstone. Mudstone and siltstone may be phosphatic. Proportion of massive sandstone increases up-section. Quartzite breccia fragments are either silicified dolostone or milky vein quartz, depending on proximity to underlying Coomalie Dolostone.|
37623|Geolsec Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Unconformably overlies Coomalie Dolostone and Whites Formation. Lower boundary recognised as sudden change from steeply dipping Coomalie Dolostone or Whites Formation to gently to moderately dipping sandstone and haematitic quartzite breccia. No units were observed directly overlying the Geolsec Formation.|
37623|Geolsec Formation|Identifying features|Breccia units comprise characteristic white, angular, small to large pebble-sized quartzite fragments within a red, fine-grained, haematitic silica matrix. Siltstone units at Geolsec and other phosphate prospects are phosphatic.|

24284|Georgina Gap granitic gneiss|Type section locality|Reference area: Markedly dissected region immediately south of Georgina Gap at GR 5751-408155 in the Laughlen 1:100 000 Sheet area.|
24284|Georgina Gap granitic gneiss|Extent|The unit crops out over an area of about 10 km2 along and east of the track to Whistleduck Bore immediately south of Georgina Gap. An apophysis of the body is photointerpreted to extend for 6 km westwards from the southern tip of the main body along the edge of the Wigley Block.|
24284|Georgina Gap granitic gneiss|Lithology|The granitic gneiss has a biotite content of up to 20 percent and is coarse-grained for the most part. It contains conspicuous megacrysts of K-feldspar. The gneissic layering is not markedly developed.|19/SEP/06
24284|Georgina Gap granitic gneiss|Relationships and boundaries|The granitic gneiss appears to intrude the Mulga Creek granitic gneiss, unassigned gneiss and amphibolite (pC), and the Laughlen metamorphics. It appears to be localised at the northeastern extension of the Redbank Deformed Zone (Marjoribanks & Black, 1974).|
24284|Georgina Gap granitic gneiss|Age reasons|Middle Proterozoic or older. Its megacrystic nature and weak gneissic fabric suggest a lithological correlation with the Gum Tree Granite which is dated at about 1000 m.y. (Allen & Black, 1979).|

24291|Gnallan-a-gea Arkose|Thickness range|This ranges from a minimum of 1450 m in the Bat Hills (where the top and bottom of the section are not exposed) to 10 m in the Keepera Ridges, with a minimum of 345 m in the type section (where the top of the section is not exposed).|
24291|Gnallan-a-gea Arkose|Lithology|Light brown to grey fine to very coarse grained pebbly arkose, sandstone, siltstone and shale. The arkose and sandstone is frequently cross-stratified.|
24291|Gnallan-a-gea Arkose|Relationships and boundaries|The lower boundary is placed at the base of the lowest pebbly arkose or sandstone above the Wonnadinna Dolomite. Regional correlations suggest that this boundary is a disconformity because a slight angular unconformity occurs at this position in the Mopunga Trough, and because of the abrupt change of lithology. The upper boundary is rarely exposed, but at Mt Winnecke and Mt Barrington (both in the Hay River 1:250 000 sheet area) it appears to be gradational with the Grant Bluff Formation, and in the Keepera Ridges the Elyuah Formation conformably overlies the Gnallan-a-gea Arkose. The upper boundary is placed at the top of the uppermost pebbly arkose.|
24291|Gnallan-a-gea Arkose|Age reasons|Adelaidean. Correlated with the lower Pertatataka Formation of the Amadeus Basin.|
21894|Gove Sandstone|Name source|Gove Peninsula (AMG PG950500) in the northeastern corner of Arnhem Land, Gove 1:250 000 scale mapsheet area.|
21894|Gove Sandstone|Unit history|Previously undifferentiated "Spencer Creek Volcanics" of Dunnet (1965).|
21894|Gove Sandstone|Geomorphic expression|Comprises white upstanding strike ridges of sandstone with a strong macroscopic conjugate joint set. Outcrop is slabby to bouldery with a pseudokarstic weathering pattern.|
21894|Gove Sandstone|Type section locality|At latitude 12o11'40"S, longitude 136o31'20"E (AMG PG655515, Gove map sheet area), 10 km southeast of Mount Bonner. The base of the section is at PG662510 and the top boundary stratotype is at PG650517. Due to poor exposure, a lower boundary stratotype is not defined.|
21894|Gove Sandstone|Extent|Outcrop occurs as a series of disconnected northeast-oriented strike ridges of white sandstone, stretching between the Cato River floodplain (PG550410, northeastern Arnhem Bay 1:250 000 scale map sheet area) and near Mount Bonner (PG670550, northwestern Gove 1:250 000 scale map sheet area).|
21894|Gove Sandstone|Thickness range|310 m near type section. To the north and south, the sequence has been partly or completely removed by the unconformity at the base of the overlying Mount Bonner Sandstone.|
21894|Gove Sandstone|Lithology|White to pink, fine- to very coarse-grained (mostly medium-grained) mature quartzose sandstone. Generally medium- to thick-bedded with low- to moderate-angle trough (and rarely planar) cross-beds or flat-bedding. Locally thin-bedded and rippled (mainly symmetrical) and less commonly, very thick-bedded and channelled with large-scale trough cross-beds. Rounded to angular quartz pebbles (up to 5 cm diameter) common at bottom and mid-way through the formation. In some areas, the basal 5 m of the unit is feldspathic or lithic, containing numerous quartz pebbles and pink felsic volcanic rock fragments. Mudstone intervals and intraclasts are rare and are restricted to the upper part (~ top 50 m) of the sequence. Outcrop exhibits characteristic surface silicification.|
21894|Gove Sandstone|Depositional environment|Shallow water, low- to moderate-energy, possibly represented by fan-delta, with braided fluvial influences near the base.|
21894|Gove Sandstone|Relationships and boundaries|Lower sandstone formation of the Spencer Creek Group. It lies disconformably upon the felsic igneous rocks of the Yanungbi Volcanics and is conformably overlain by the fine-grained siliciclastic rocks of the Yuduyudu Formation. The lower contact is not exposed but appears to be mildly erosional. The basal part of the Gove Sandstone is notably lithic and felspathic. Around PG570420, this erosion has completely removed the volcanics and the Gove Sandstone sits unconformably on the Dhalinybuy Granite. The contact with the overlying Yuduyudu Formation is poorly exposed at the top boundary stratotype, but appears to be a conformable gradation from white quartzose sandstone into ferruginous fine-grained sandstone and mudstone. North and south of the type section this formation has been partly or completely eroded prior to deposition of the unconformably overlying Mount Bonner Sandstone.|
21894|Gove Sandstone|Age reasons|Palaeoproterozoic (Statherian). Constrained by the enclosing Yanungbi Volcanics/Latram Granite and Cato Volcanics, which are ~1710 Ma (Rawlings and others, in prep.).|
21894|Gove Sandstone|Correlations|Rawlings and others (in prep.) and Rawlings (1994) suggest correlation with the upper parts of the Tawallah and Katherine River Groups in the southern and western McArthur Basin respectively. Locally, it correlates with the Fagan Volcanics in southern Arnhem Bay and northern Blue Mud Bay map sheet areas.|

7652|Grace Creek Granite|Name source|Named by Randal (1963) the Grace Creek Granite has been described by Stewart (1965) and Walpole & others (1968). Recent work has changed the extent, stratigraphic relationship and age of the unit (Needham & Stuart-Smith, in press).|
7652|Grace Creek Granite|Type section locality|Hills 3 km north of Grace Creek tin prospect, latitude 14o6'S, longitude 132o52'E; red xenolithic xenocrystic fine to medium granite.|
7652|Grace Creek Granite|Extent|Southeastern half of the triangular "Grace Creek Inlier" which is coextensive with the Katherine River basin upstream from Katherine Gorge. About 750 km2 of outcrop, mainly south of Ironbark Creek, with possibly about another 100 km2 concealed by Kombolgie Formation mainly east of the 'Grace Creek Inlier".|
7652|Grace Creek Granite|Lithology|Reddish xenolithic and xenocrystic granite, roughly zoned into porphyritic microgranite near the margin, through porphyritic pink-grey and slightly porphyritic grey-green medium grained granite, to fine to medium grained equigranular light grey-pink biotite granite near the centre, around the Grace Creek tin prospect (Needham & Stuart-Smith, 1984). The microgranite is very similar to the reddish xenolithic ignimbrites of the Plum Tree Creek Volcanics which surround most of the Grace Creek Granite, but can be distinguished from them by the presence of corroded orthoclase xenocrysts up to 6 cm across. Both the granite/microgranite and the ignimbrite contain xenocrysts or phenocrysts of quartz, in places up to 1 cm across.|
7652|Grace Creek Granite|Relationships and boundaries|Owing to the similarity between the microgranite and surrounding ignimbrite an accurate boundary cannot be established. They may indeed by coeval and comagmatic. The granite intrudes the Hindrance Creek Sandstone of the Edith River Group, and is unconformably overlain by Kombolgie Formation sandstone. It is cut by numerous NE-trending dolerite dykes which also cut the Kombolgie Formation.|
7652|Grace Creek Granite|Age reasons|Leggo (in Walpole and others 1968) reported a Rb/Sr isochron age of 1470 Ma which is demonstrably incorrect in view of the granite's unconformity beneath ~1645 Ma Kombolgie Formation (Page & others, 1980). Field evidence suggests that the granite is coeval with the Plum Tree Creek Volcanics which have an age of 1803 +/- 10 Ma (Page R.W., pers. comm. 1984). Relationships with the Eva Valley Granite and Tollis Formation in the Yeuralba area are equivocal and provide no constraints on the age of the granite.|

7690|Grant Bluff Formation|Identifying features|The definition of the grant Bluff Formation of Smith (1964) is here restricted to exclude the upper, recessively weathering sequence in the type section and elsewhere; i.e. to exclude the sequence from the 168 m level up to the base of the Mt Baldwin Formation in section 13 of Walter (1979) (which is the type section, designated X3 by Smith, 1964). The grant Bluff Formation as redefined consists largely of thin-bedded sandstone in the Alcoota and Huckitta 1:250 000 Sheet area; in the northeastern Hay River Sheet area it is much thicker and includes thick interbeds of siltstone.  As redefined, the formation is 90 m thick in its type section. The base is as defined by Smith, at the base of the lowest thin-bedded sandstone above the shales of the Elyuah Formation. The top is defined here as the top of the uppermost thin-bedded sandstone below the recessively weathering shales, siltstones, dolomite and sandstone of the Elkera Formation.|

21914|Grindall Formation|Geomorphic expression|Low rubbly hills, wave cut platforms and cliffs along coasts.|
21914|Grindall Formation|Type section locality|Plumb and Roberts (1992) nominate the eastern end of Morgan Island (latitude 13o28'S, longitude 136o06'E; AMG PF195103) as the type locality. Here the sequence is folded and mostly steeply dipping. A short distance to the west the formation is intruded by the Bukudal Granite and is overlain unconformably by flat-lying Woodah Sandstone (Groote Eylandt Group).|
21914|Grindall Formation|Extent|Eastern Blue Mud Bay 1:250 000 scale map sheet area, specifically eastern flank of Coast Range, Morgan Island, Burney Island, northern Bickerton Island and small islands to the north of Bickerton Island.|
21914|Grindall Formation|Thickness range|Unknown as the sequence is tightly folded and no stratigraphic base or top can be identified. Probably in excess of 1000 m thick.|
21914|Grindall Formation|Lithology|Red-brown to grey-green, fine- to medium-grained, thin- to thick-bedded, lithic sandstone generally interbedded with mudstone. Discrete sandstone beds are typically sharp-based and often graded. Schist, phyllite and metasandstone locally present in the Coast Range area.|
21914|Grindall Formation|Depositional environment|Considered to be, at least in part, a turbiditic sequence.|
21914|Grindall Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Oldest known component of the Arnhem Inlier. No base exposed. Contact with younger units clearly marked by distinct angular unconformity commonly succeeded by a basal conglomerate. Overlain unconformably by various units of the Groote Eylandt Group and locally by the Jalma Formation and un-named volcanics along Coast Range. Intruded by the Bradshaw Complex, Bukudal Granite, and various mafic and felsic dykes.|
21914|Grindall Formation|Age reasons|Probably Palaeoproterozoic, but constrained only by the minimum age of 1870 Ma provided by the oldest known intrusives, the Bradshaw Complex (Pietsch and others, 1994). Pietsch and others (1994) indicate it was deposited pre-Barramundi Oreogeny (1885-1870 Ma).|

27994|Gundi Sandstone|Name source|From Gundi Creek in KATHERINE, which intersects the formation at around lat. 14o24'S, long. 133o00'E.|
27994|Gundi Sandstone|Unit history|Replaces the name "Gundi Greywacke"; see below under COMMENTS for discussion.|
27994|Gundi Sandstone|Geomorphic expression|Resistant ridges and plateaux, deeply incised along joints, to give a highly distinctive rough surface.|
27994|Gundi Sandstone|Type section locality|From lat. 14o13.5'S, long. 133o7.5'E (base) to 14o13.6'S, long. 133o8.1'E (top).|
27994|Gundi Sandstone|Extent|The most southwesterly outcrops are in the Waterhouse Syncline in northeastern KATHERINE; more extensive outcrops are in MOUNT MARUMBA and southeastern MILINGIMBI 1:250 000 sheet areas.|
27994|Gundi Sandstone|Thickness range|130 m in type section, but ranging from 80 m to 300 m within a few kilometres of that section on northwestern limb of Waterhouse Syncline.|
27994|Gundi Sandstone|Lithology|Lithologically rather uniform, of medium- to very coarse-grained and minor pebbly sandstone. Monocrystalline and polycrystalline quartz comprises 70-80%, lithic fragments 5-15% and feldspar less than 5% (generally less than 3%) of grains. Sericite/illite is common, mainly as a constituent of lithic fragments, but to a lesser extent as an interstitial mineral. The interstitial mineral is clearly diagenetic, and rarely exceeds 1% by volume of the rock. Furthermore, it appears to have formed during late diagenesis as it postdates the quartz cement in many cases.|
27994|Gundi Sandstone|Depositional environment|Mainly braided fluvial; may be minor shallow marine.|
27994|Gundi Sandstone|Relationships and boundaries|The contact with the underlying Diamond Creek Volcanics is placed at the abrupt change from vesicular basic volcanic rocks to quartz arenite. The contact is sharp and presumed unconformable. The upper contact is placed at the upper limit of quartz arenite, with a change to the more lithic sandstone,  cobble to boulder conglomerate, and mafic volcanics of the overlying West Branch Volcanics. The contact is locally unconformable where conglomerate lies above sandstone, but may be conformable elsewhere.|
27994|Gundi Sandstone|Age reasons|Statherian Period of Palaeoproterozoic. The age is constrained only by the 1830 Ma age for parts of the underlying Edith River Group, and by the 1710 Ma age for the overlying West Branch Volcanics. The actual age is likely to be much closer to that of the West Branch Volcanics, as Diamond Creek volcanism, which preceeded Gundi deposition, appears to be an early phase of the activity which culminated in extrusion of the West Branch Volcanics.|
27994|Gundi Sandstone|Correlations|Upper Tawallah Group in central McArthur Basin (in part); particularly Warramana Sandstone.|
27994|Gundi Sandstone|Comments|The Gundi Sandstone was mapped and described by Ruker (1959) as the Gundi Creek Greywacke Member of the Kombolgie Formation. Randal (1963) modified the name to Gundi Greywacke Member and assigned it to his newly erected Diljin Hill Formation. Roberts & Plumb (1965) raised the unit to formation rank as the Gundi Greywacke, and this conception was maintained by Walpole and others (1968). The published name is varied here because the unit is not a greywacke, but a relatively well sorted quartz arenite or sublitharenite with minor authigenic clay "pseudomatrix".|

26306|Hagen Member|Extent|Intersected in NTGS cored drillholes ELK6 and ELK7A. No known outcrop.|
26306|Hagen Member|Thickness range|In ELK7A is 95.28 m thick, in ELK6 (AMG reference NR051740) is about 115 m thick.|
26306|Hagen Member|Lithology|The holostratotype is summarised below. Above 153.48 m in ELK7A is the upper part of the Chabalowe Formation. The top of the Hagen Member of the Chabalowe Formation is identified by the thick gypsum and anhydrite-rich bed, underlying the sandstone-dominant upper unit of the Chabalowe Formation. TOP: 15.38 m (153.48-169.31 m) Interbedded gypsum, gypsiferous siltstone and chert (silicified algal laminate); minor anhydrite. 3.89 m (169.31-173.20 m) Dolostone, algal laminate and fine-grained dolarenite; minor dololutite. 9.38 m (173.20-182.58 m) Massive gypsum (satin spar) interbedded with siltstone, chert and dolostone, minor anhydrite. 55.47 m (182.58-238.05 m) Dolostone in part stromatolitic, dolorudite, dolarenite, dololutite, intraformational breccia. 10.71 m (238.05-248.76 m) Dolostone, silty grainstone, dolomitic siltstone.

26306|Hagen Member|Relationships and boundaries|Lenticular and represents the basal section of the Chabalowe Formation in Elkedra; laterally equivalent to and partly overlies the Arthur Creek Formation. Unconformably overlies Proterozoic rocks in ELK6. The Hagen Member is distinguished from the upper part of the Chabalowe Formation by the abundance of evaporite minerals and significantly less terrigenous clastic material.|
26306|Hagen Member|Age reasons|Middle Cambrian as inferred from its relationship with the Arthur Creek Formation which contains trilobite fauna of Templetonian age.|

25689|Hale Formation|Name source|Hale Plain, which extends east-west between The Garden and Claraville homesteads, Alice Springs 1:250 000 Sheet area.|
25689|Hale Formation|Unit history|The sediments of the Hale Plain have been referred to as Arltungan Series by Madigan (1932), Arltungan Formation by Madigan (1936), Arltunga Series by Hossfeld (1954), and Arltungan Beds by Joklik (1955). (The Arltunga Quartzite of Chewings (1928) is now mapped as part of the Heavitree Quartzite). Smith (1963(b)) revised the name to Arltunga Beds. The type locality of the Beds is in a separate basin from the Hale Formtion, and is located at the western end of Paddys Plain,   km west of Arltunga, where they comprise arenaceous limestone, silicified limestone, and pebbly sandstone. Hence the Arltunga Beds differ lithologically, and were deposited in a separate place from the Hale Formation, and the name Arltunga Beds is restricted to the sediments in Paddys Plain.|
25689|Hale Formation|Type section locality|Diamond Drillhole BMR 2 at GR 240088 Alice Springs 1:250 000 Sheet area.|
25689|Hale Formation|Extent|The unit crops out sporadically across the Hale Plain, but is better known in subcrop from extensive drilling information (Clarke).|
25689|Hale Formation|Thickness range|10-75 m (approximate).|
25689|Hale Formation|Lithology|Kaolinitic quartzose sandstone, siltstone, and mudstone grading locally at the margins of the basin into coarse-grained, poorly sorted boulder conglomerate. A thin horizon of lignite in subcrop is named the Ulgnamba Lignite Member.|
25689|Hale Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The Formation is underlain in places by a laterite profile with well-developed ferruginous mottled and leached zones. It is overlain at one locality nortwest of Claraville homestead by a unit of greenish-grey siltstone and chalcedonic limestone (informal unit Tw). Elsewhere, the formation is overlain by unconsolidated Cainozoic deposits - mainly alluvium.|
25689|Hale Formation|Age reasons|The lignite member is possibly Eocene. The underlying weathering profile is possibly Maastrichtian to Early Eocene (Idnurm & Senior, 1978). Younger intercalated silcrete is possibly Late Oligocene to Miocene.|

24304|Hanlon Subgroup|Unit history|None. Corresponds to the Upper Hatches Creek Group of Blake & Wyche (1983 - BMR Rec. 1983/18) and Blake & others (1982 - BMR Rep. 239, 1983 - BMR 83), except that it also includes the Errolola Sandstone (at its base).|
24304|Hanlon Subgroup|Constituents|From base to top - Errolola Sandstone, Alinjabon Sandstone, Lennee Creek Formation, Canulgerra Sandstone, Vaddingilla Formation, Yaddanilla Sandstone.|
24304|Hanlon Subgroup|Type section locality|Reference area: Western part of Hanlon 1:100 000 Sheet area, west of Vaddingilla Rockhole (GR 681996).|
24304|Hanlon Subgroup|Extent|Nearly complete section of Subgroup exposed in western part of Hanlon 1:100 000 Sheet area; lower part preserved in keels of several synclines in the Hatches, Elkedra, Davenport Range, Bonney, and Murray Downs 1:100 000 Sheet areas (Frew River, Elkedrak, Bonney Well, and Barrow Creek 1:250 000 Sheet areas).|
24304|Hanlon Subgroup|Thickness range|Maximum expoised is about 5200 m, in western part of Hanlon 1:100 000 Sheet area.|
24304|Hanlon Subgroup|Lithology|Fine to medium-grained quartzose and feldspathic/lithic/kaolinitic arenites, siltstone, and shale; minor coarse arenite, pebbly conglomerate, calcareous beds, and mafic lava; cross-bedding, wave and current ripple marks and mudflakes common.|
24304|Hanlon Subgroup|Relationships and boundaries|Conformably overlies the Wauchope Subgroup of the Hatches Creek Group. Unconformably overlain by Cambrian rocks.|
24304|Hanlon Subgroup|Age reasons|Younger than 1870 m.y. - U-Pb zircon age of volcanics in the Warramunga Group unconformably overlain by the Hatches Creek Group. Older than 1640 m.y. - Rb-Sr whole-rock approximate age of granite intruding the Hatches Creek Group.|
24304|Hanlon Subgroup|Comments|Discussion: The Hanlon Subgroup is the youngest of three subgroups making up the Hatches Creek Group. The 6 formations comprising the Hanlon Subgroup are probably all marine - the sandstones appear to have been lain down in nearshore, partly intertidal environments and the finer grained rocks in deeper, quieter water. The subgroup differs from the two older subgroups of the Hatches Creek Group in that it contains few volcanics and virtually no fluvial sediments.|

24306|Harry Anorthositic Gabbro|Unit history|Previously mapped by Wells & others (1968) as undivided Arunta Complex.|
24306|Harry Anorthositic Gabbro|Type section locality|3 km west-southwest of Johannsen's Phlogopite Mine at GR 5751-055292.|
24306|Harry Anorthositic Gabbro|Extent|The unit crops out in an east-west belt, and forms an area of subdued relief in the foothills of the Utnalanama Range southwest of Johannsen's Phlogopite Mine (GR 5751-079306), Laughlen 1:100 000 Sheet area.|
24306|Harry Anorthositic Gabbro|Lithology|The most common rock type of the unit is anorthositic gabbro in the classification of Buddington (1939 p.19), although rock types range from pyroxenitic to anorthositic end members. Ultramafic and mafic end members are less common than anorthositic rocks. The rock has been regionally metamorphosed, and only a few relict igneous patches survive.|
24306|Harry Anorthositic Gabbro|Relationships and boundaries|The Gabbro appears to be a single body which intrudes, and is thought to be highly interfolded with, the Utnalanama granulite. The gabbro is truncated in the northeast by an interpreted unconformity separating it from the overlying Erontonga metamorphics. It is also truncated in the southwest by the Gumtree Granite, and in the south by the Harry Creek Deformed Zone.|
24306|Harry Anorthositic Gabbro|Age reasons|Mid-Proterozoic or older. The granulite facies metamorphism which affects the unit has been dated at 1800 m.y. using 40Ar-39Ar methods (Allen & Stubbs, in press).|
24306|Harry Anorthositic Gabbro|Proposed publication|Stewart & others in prep.|
24306|Harry Anorthositic Gabbro|Comments|Note on rock type name: The adoption of igneous, rather than metamorphic, terminology follows international usage (e.g. in Greenland) for similar rocks.  Remarks: A R. Allen considers that because the Gabbro unconformably underlies the Erontonga metamorphics, it should not be included in the Strangways Metamorphic Complex.|

24307|Harverson Granite|Extent|An equant body about 8 km across which crops out between Lander Rock and Harverson Pass, in Reynolds Range 1:100 000 Sheet area.|
24307|Harverson Granite|Lithology|Coarse porphyritic leucocratic grey granite, massive (structureless), consisting of tubby phenocrysts of microcline up to 7 cm long in groundmass of microcline, plagioclase, quartz, biotite, and muscovite (the last two interleaved in places). Deuterically altered.|
24307|Harverson Granite|Relationships and boundaries|Intrudes and metamorphoses Lander Rock beds; is ;intruded by a large number of quartz veins (48 mapped), by a few dykes of aplite and pegmatite. Not intruded by basic dykes. Contact with adjoining Mount Airy Orthogneiss (q.v.) obscured by alluvium, but Mount Airy Orthogneiss is intruded by numerous basic dykes and therefore is probably intruded by Harverson grnaite after emplacement of basic dykes finished. |
24307|Harverson Granite|Identifying features|Reason for proposed name:  Distinctive granite mass and different in texture and dyke abundance from neighbouring granites.|
24307|Harverson Granite|Age reasons|No isotopic date available (sampled 1972 L.P. Black). Adjoining (and older?) Mount jAiry Orthogneiss is possibly a facies variant of or at least contemporaneous intrusion with Napperby Gneiss dated at 1800-1500 m.y. on muscovite and whole-rock Rb-Sr (L P Black, BMR, pers. comm., 1975). Therefore, Harverson Granite probably Middle Proterozoic.|

8139|Hatches Creek Group|Name source|Hatches Creek watercourse in the south of Hatches 1:100 0000 Sheet area, Frew River 1:250 000 Sheet area.|
8139|Hatches Creek Group|Unit history|Named by Sullivan (1953 - Geology of Australian Ore Deposits, AIMM, 1, 322-6), and Hossfeld (1954 - Trans Roy. Soc. S.Aust, 77, 103-61); name retained, but usage slightly modified, by Smith & others (1961 - BMR Report 58) and Ryan (1961 - BMR Bulletin 6), whose usage is followed in this definition. However, the Hatches Creek Group has not previously been subdivided into formally named constituent units.|
8139|Hatches Creek Group|Constituents|The Hatches Creek Group is subdivided into 3 new subgroups, 20 new formations, and 2 new members. 7 formations are assigned to the Ooradidgee Subgroup (lowest of the three subgroups) - Epenarra Volcanics, Edmirringee Volcanics, Rooneys Formation, Kurinella Sandstone, Taragan Sandstone, Treasure Volcanics, and Mia Mia Volcanics; 7 formations are assigned to the Wauchope Subgroup (the middle subgroup) - Unimbra Sandstone, Yeeradgi Sandstone, Newlands Volcanics, Arabulja Volcanics, Coulters Sandstone, Frew River Formation, and Kudinga Basalt; and 6 formations are assigned to the Hanlon Subgroup (uppermost) - Errolola Sandstone, Alinjabon Sandstone, Lennee Creek Formation, Canulgerra Sandstone, Vaddingilla Formation, and Yaddanilla Sandstone. The Kurinelli Sandstone of the Ooradidgee Subgroup includes two new members - Endurance Sandstone Member and Warnes Sandstone Member. Contacts between the formations are generally conformable, although some local unconformities have been recognised within the Hatches Creek Group. The Wauchope Subgroup contains 2 region-wide ridge-forming formations - the Unimbra Sandstone at the base, and the Coulters Sandstone in the middle - between the above which are relatively recessive formations. The formations of the Ooradidgee Subgroup, underlying the Unimbra Sandstone, are partly lateral facies equivalents of one another, and are not as extensive as those of the Wauchope Subgroup. The formations of the Hanlon Subgroup form a layer-cake stratigraphy, as do those of the Wauchope Subgroup, but have a more restricted distribution.|
8139|Hatches Creek Group|Extent|Forms most of the Davenport and Murchison Ranges, cropping out in northern and central Bonney Well, southwestern Frew River, northeastern (and also northwestern) Barrow Creek, and northwestern Elkedra 1:250 000 Sheet areas.|
8139|Hatches Creek Group|Thickness range|Maximum probably at least 10 000 m.|
8139|Hatches Creek Group|Lithology|Ridge-forming cross-bedded quartz arenite, feldspathic/lithic quartz arenite, and minor conglomeratic arenite, and recessive basaltic and felsic lavas and pyroclastics, friable arenite, siltstone, shale and minor carbonates.|
8139|Hatches Creek Group|Relationships and boundaries|Unconformable on the Warramunga Group in the north; base not seen elsewhere. Intruded by mainly sill-like bodies of dolerite/gabbro and granophyre (which may be comagmatic with volcanics within the Hatches Creek Group), and by plutons of Devils Marbles Granite, Elkedra Granite and unnamed granite which postdate the main deformation of the Hatches Creek Group.|
8139|Hatches Creek Group|Age reasons|Younger than 1870 m.y. - U-Pb zircon age for volcanics in the unconformably underlying Warramunga Group. Older than 1640m.y. - Rb-Sr whole-rock approximate age for the Elkedra Granite, which intrudes the Hatches Creek Group.|

8139|Hatches Creek Group|Comments|Remarks: The Hatches Creek Group, as descriabed by Hossfeld (1954), comprises rocks he had previously assigned to the Hatches Creek Series and the Top Series (in AGGSNA, 1941 - Rep. For period ended 31 December 1940). Smith & others (1961) extended the Group to include Hossfeld's Bottom Series which previously was considered to underlie the Hatches Creek Series unconformably (Hossfeld, 1954; AGGSNA, 1941), but was found by Smith & others to be part of the same concordant and generally conformable sequence. In the new stratigraphic nomenclature, Hossfeld's Bottom Series and Top Series are part of the Ooradidgee Subgroup, and his Hatches Creek Series corresponds to parts of both the Ooradidgee and Wauchope Subgroups.|

Dolerite dykes of the Stuart Dyke Swarm intrude the Complex. The Alice Springs Granite (new name) and the Jessie Gap gneiss (new name) may intrude the Complex.|
27290|Hayes Metamorphic Complex|Identifying features|Reason for proposed name: Crystalline basement to the Iwupataka Metamorphic Complex (new name).|
27290|Hayes Metamorphic Complex|Age reasons|The Hayes Metamorphci Complex is older than the Late Proterozoic overlying Heavitree Quartzite and the intruding dolerite dykes. The Alice Springs Granite and the Jessie Gap gneiss may have been emplaced or partly intruded into the Hayes Metamorphic Complex at about 1080 m.y. (the age of the migmatite event which affects the southwestern Arunta Block). The component units of the Hayes Metamorphic Complex are thought to have been metamorphosed during the Chewings Phase of deformation at about 1620 +/- 70 m.y.|

8199|Hayward Creek Formation|Type section locality|From GR 410883 to GR 408883. Here the pebbly lithic sandstone and conglomerate of the Blanche Creek Member passes upward into medium grained clean quartz sandstone (orthoquartzite) about 1000 m thick. The basal part of the quartz sandstone is torrentially cross-bedded on a small scale and shows a few symmetrical ripple marks. In the lower half of the sandstone there are a few pebbly beds, 15-30 cm thick, of subrounded white quartz and pink and grey silicified orthoquartzite, 3-4 cm across, in an orthoquartzite matrix; red jasper pebbles form about 1 percent of the rock. In the upper half, the grain size decreases; pebbles are less abundant and smaller, and the sandstone is fine to medium-grained. The topmost 2000 m at the type section locality consists of cream to red, silicified, clean quartz sandstone and feldspathic sandstone. It is thin to thick-bedded, flaggy to massive, and is commonly cross-bedded.|
8199|Hayward Creek Formation|Extent|Constitutes a large part of the Whittington and the Short Ranges, Tennant Creek 1:250 000 Sheet area, and it also crops out in the northwest corner of the Sheet area.

8293|Hermit Creek Metamorphics|Type section locality|Auxiliary reference section: Good exposure along the base of an escarpment. The section lies in overturned, steeply dipping strata between 130o26'15"E, 14o11'09"S and 130o24'59"E, 14o12'02"S and typifies the known lithologies, although primary igneous textures are better preserved than is normally the case, and the section does not expose the entire sequence. A further reference locality for high grade metasediments illustrating preserved bedding lies at 130o33'35"E, 13o59'11"S, although outcrop at this site is poor.|
8293|Hermit Creek Metamorphics|Extent|The unit's known distribution totals 60 km2 in limited areas of exposure south-southwest of Twin Peaks (Daly River 1:100 000 sheet area) as far as 2 km southwest of Buffalo Fly Hill (130o25'02"E, 14o11'30"S, Moyle 1:100 000 sheet area).|
8293|Hermit Creek Metamorphics|Thickness range|The section totals approximately 2350 m. The lower sediment member is 700 m thick overlain by 850 m of basalts with basal dolerites, then a further 800 m of sediments. The total thickness of the unit is not known but it may be up to twice that of this section.|
8293|Hermit Creek Metamorphics|Identifying features|Revision of old terms: This unit (defined by Walpole, Crohn, Dunn and Randall, 1968: Geology of the Darwin-Katherine region, Northern Territory, BMRGGA Bulletin No. 82) involves much less than was originally included in the unit, much of it now forming the Quartz Knob Metamorphics. This is essentially a division of the old unit also providing a good auxiliary section.|
8293|Hermit Creek Metamorphics|Age reasons|The Buffallo Fly Hill granodiorite (informal name for 1840 Ma granitoid) intrudes the Hermit Creek Metamorphics subsequent to the second deformational event and it is therefore somewhat older than late lower Proterozoic. It may be coeval with some of the older units in the Pine Creek Geosyncline and is thought to be early or middle lower Proterozoic.|

22013|Jalma Formation|Type section locality|Along Coast Range at latitude 13o31'S, longitude 135o48'E. Base at AMG NF865051 and top at AMG NF858055. This section is the only location where part of the upper recessive interval is exposed.|
22013|Jalma Formation|Extent|Outcrops restricted to the Coast Range, Grindall Point and Gan Gan areas in the Blue Mud Bay 1:250 000 map sheet area.|
22013|Jalma Formation|Thickness range|Complete sections only present along coast Range where the thickness varies from about 70 m to 130 m. Estimated to be about 110 m at the type section.|
22013|Jalma Formation|Lithology|Main part of formation consists of brown to purple, medium-grained, thin- to medium-bedded, ferruginous sandstone. Probably pyritic at depth. Fine-grained, thin-bedded, flaggy sandstone near base. Local basal polymict cobble conglomerate south of type section. Upper very recessive unit of laminated mudstone (exposed only at type section).|
22013|Jalma Formation|Depositional environment|Probably shallow marine.|
22013|Jalma Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Not assigned to any group. Unconformably overlies the Coast Range Sandstone and locally the underlying Grindall Formation where the unconformity cuts to that level. At the type section the base is picked at the contact between medium-grained, thick-bedded, white, quartz-rich sandstone (Coast Range Sandstone) and recessive fine-grained, flaggy sandstone above. Actual point of contact obscured here. Overlain unconformably (regional evidence of truncation at contact) by the Balbirini Dolomite but the actual point of contact is obscured by younger cover. At the type section the top is picked below the ridge of prominent stromatolitic chert at the base of the Balbirini Dolomite.|

Western end shows excellent exposures of migmatitic layered coarse granitic gneiss, grading eastward to agmatitic augen gneiss to porphyritic orthogneiss (or gneissic granite) containing enclaves of amphibolite at eastern end.|
27291|Jennings Granitic Gneiss|Extent|1. Large body in southeast of Laughlen 1:100 000 Sheet area; just extends S. into  Undoolya  2. Separate large body in northeast of Undoolya 1:100 000 Sheet area.|
27291|Jennings Granitic Gneiss|Lithology|The two large bodies consist of coarse granitic gneiss which is heterogeneous and grades into agmatitic augen gneiss and into porphyritic orthogneiss in places. Centre of eastern body of Gneiss occupied by finer-grained granitic gneiss (mapped separately). Eastern body also includes six elongate masses of quartzofeldspathic gneiss. Both eastern and western bodies contain numerous inclusions and rafts of amphibolite (included in Gneiss unit).|
27291|Jennings Granitic Gneiss|Relationships and boundaries|Western margin of eastern body of Gneiss macroscopically discordant to trends in adjoining Randall Peak metamorphics. Concordantly surrounds separate large lens of Randall Peak metamorphics and another large lens of hornblende gneiss of unnamed unit pCv. Western body of Gneiss concordant with Randall Peak metamorphics to north. Intrudes small body of biotite gneiss of unnamed unit pC. Hence, Jennings Granitic Gneiss is in some places discordant with and intrusive into surrounding country rocks, elsewhere is concordant with them. Intruded by Mordor Igneous Complex. Unconformably overlain by Heavitree Quartzite to south, east and north.|
27291|Jennings Granitic Gneiss|Identifying features|Reason for proposed name: Easily reacognised mass of granitic gneiss markedly different from the amphibolite-bearing Randall Peak metamorphics (name to be submitted by R D Shaw) to west.|
27291|Jennings Granitic Gneiss|Age reasons|Three whole-rock samples lie on Rb-Sr isochron giving age = 1719 +/- 24 m.y., low initial 87Sr/86Sr ratio indicates this is time of crystallisation of Granitic Gneiss (contemporaneous with intrusion as granite during active metamorphism and deformation of the region, resulting in gneissic fabric).|

22033|Jigaimara Formation|Unit history|Plumb and others (1976) assigned the outcrop at Warnga Point on Elcho Island to the Elcho Island Formation, and two outcrops on Howard Island were also mapped as Elcho Island Formation by Dunnet (1965). However, most outcrops have not been previously mapped.|03/DEC/12
22033|Jigaimara Formation|Geomorphic expression|Rocky wave cut platforms.|03/DEC/12
22033|Jigaimara Formation|Type section locality|At latitude 12o14'S, longitude 135o09'30"E (AMG NG172478) on western tip of Banyan Island, Arnhem Bay 1:250 000 scale map sheet area. The approximate top of the underlying Elcho Island Formation is exposed at AMG NG223477 about 5 km east and at what is interpreted as a stratigraphically slightly lower position. The contact is covered. The outcrop at the type locality dips very gently north beneath the sea and no upper boundary stratotype can be nominated.|03/DEC/12
22033|Jigaimara Formation|Extent|Crops out at Warnga Point on Elcho Island, along the north coast of Howard and Banyan Islands, and on several small islands north and northeast of Milingimbi. A sequence of interbedded limestone, shale and dolostone with the same trilobite fauna was intersected (no core) in Arafura No. 1 ( Van Roye, 1983) in the Arafura Sea (latitude 10o27'08"S, longitude 134o03'22"E), and is tentatively considered to represent the same formation.|03/DEC/12
22033|Jigaimara Formation|Thickness range|The nearly flat-lying coastal outcrops only contain a few metres of outcrop each. A thickness of 370 m (between 3126 m and 3596 m) is tentatively assigned to formation in Arafura No. 1.|03/DEC/12
22033|Jigaimara Formation|Lithology|All outcrops are silicified and consist of white to grey-brown chert and cherty siltstone (presumably after limestone and calcareous siltstone). Outcrops are invariably brecciated to various degrees (jigsaw-fit to totally chaotic) with a siliceous matrix. Individual clasts are commonly well laminated and possible microbial laminations also present. Trilobite fossils are common but most are fragmentary.|03/DEC/12
22033|Jigaimara Formation|Depositional environment|Shallow marine, probably subtidal.|03/DEC/12
22033|Jigaimara Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Overlies the Elcho Island Formation of the Wessell Group. The actual contact is not exposed but is inferred to be a disconformity or unconformity as the Wessel Group is now interpreted to be Neoproterozoic in age (Rawlings and others, in prep.). Boundary is placed at the gap between flaggy sandstones (Elcho Island Formation) and silicified carbonates and calcareous siltstones (Jigaimara Formation). Van Roye (1983) interpret a break between the what is tentatively assigned to the Jigaimara Formation and underlying Proterozoic (possibly Elcho Island Formation) in Arafura No. 1. No overlying unit is exposed. Overlain by a 1128 m thick unnamed dolomitic unit in Arafura No. 1, which Bradshaw and others assign to the Goulburn Group. The Jigaimara Formation remains ungrouped at this stage.|03/DEC/12
22033|Jigaimara Formation|Age reasons|Middle Cambrian (Templetonian) on palaeontological (trilobites) evidence (Plumb and others, 1976).|03/DEC/12
22033|Jigaimara Formation|Correlations|On fossil evidence it correlates with the Beetle Creek Formation and its correlataives in the Georgina Basin (Plumb and others, 1976).|03/DEC/12

32314|Jimbu Microgranite|Name source|From Jimbu Creek, a tributary of the Mann River, NE Mount Marumba 1:250 000 sheet area.|
32314|Jimbu Microgranite|Unit history|Previously called Mann River Porphyry (Patterson, 1954), but invalid because of prior usage. Subsequently called Jimbu Granite by Roberts and Plumb (1965) and defined by Plumb & Roberts (1992).|
32314|Jimbu Microgranite|Geomorphic expression|Generally recessive, with scattered outcrop of small exfoliating tors and boulders.|
32314|Jimbu Microgranite|Type section locality|Plumb and Roberts (1992) nominated the McKay Dome (13o15'S and 133o58'E) as the type area.|
32314|Jimbu Microgranite|Extent|Exposed in the core of three domes in the Shadforth and McKay Hills area, in northeast Mount Marumba 1:250 000 sheet area. Two of these domes have been informally named - the Shadforth Dome at 13o7'S and 134o02'E, and the McKay Dome at 13o15'S and 133o58'E. The largest area of outcrop occurs at an unnamed dome to the SW of the McKay Hills at 13o18'S and 133o45'E.|
32314|Jimbu Microgranite|Lithology|Dominantly pink-green, massive, porphyritic microgranite, with lesser aplite and pegmatite granophyre veins and dykes. Porphyritic microgranite comprises K-feldspar and lesser quartz, plagioclase and ferromagnesian phenocrysts, set in a green to brown microcrystalline quartz-feldspar-chlorite groundmass. K-feldspar phenocrysts are up to 6 cm diameter (average 1.5 cm), round to tabular shaped,skeletal, and often exhibit a red albite outer margin (rapikivi texture). Quartz phenocrysts are resorbed and embayed and average ~0.5 cm diameter. Masses of fine-grained ferromagnesian minerals appear to have replaced primary ferromagnesian minerals. Aplite veins and dykes up to 0.5 m wide are composed of a similar lithology to the groundmass of the porphyry. Granophyre and pegmatite form metre-scale dykes and irregular masses at the inferred upper margin of the plutons. They comprise coarse cuneiform-textured intergrowths of K-feldspar and quartz. Large xenoliths of microgranite, with a similar mineralogy and texture to the groundmass of the porphyritic microgranite host, are locally present. Quartzose sandstone xenoliths are rare.|
32314|Jimbu Microgranite|Relationships and boundaries|Intrudes various units of the Katherine River Group up to and including Gundi Sandstone. The contact is sharp, but with a narrow thermal aureole of intensified silicification and quartz veining. Field relationships in the vicinity of the domes are consistent with emplacement of the Jimbu Microgranite during deposition of the upper Gundi Sandstone, therefore predating the West Branch Volcanics (Rawlings and Page, in prep.). This is supported by the geochronology.|
32314|Jimbu Microgranite|Age reasons|Palaeoproterozoic: SHRIMP U-Pb zircon dating provides a crystallisation and emplacement age of 1720 +/- 7 Ma (Rawlings and Page, in prep.).|
32314|Jimbu Microgranite|Correlations|Belongs to the 'Fagan phase' of Rawlings (1994), which includes the West Branch Volcanics (Arnhem Shelf), Spencer Creek Group, Fagan and Gadabara Volcanics (Walker Fault Zone and Caledon Shelf), Tanumbirini Rhyolite (Batten Fault Zone and Bauhinia Shelf) and the Packsaddle Microgranite/Hobblechain Rhyolite (Wearyan Shelf). These units relate to a discrete phase of magmatism in the McArthur Basin, but absolute time correlation is not inferred.|
32314|Jimbu Microgranite|Proposed publication|Mount Marumba Explanatory Notes (Sweet et al., 1997)|
32314|Jimbu Microgranite|Comments|Roberts and Plumb (1965) assigned this unit to 'basement', citing an unconformable relationship with the overlying Katherine River Group. However, field relationships (Rawlings and Page, in prep.; Sweet et al, in prep.) are consistent with an intrusive relationship with the Katherine River Group and the unit has been redefined accordingly. The overall texture of the unit is porphyritic with a uniformly fine-grained microgranitic groundmass. Consequently, the name 'Jimbu Granite' is herein revised to 'Jimbu Microgranite' to embrace more aptly this texture.|

Thicknesses in cored drillholes are treated as definitive.|
24641|Jinduckin Formation|Lithology|Maroon-green dolomitic-siliciclastic siltstones grading into dolomitic wavy and lenticular sandstone-siltstone interbeds; dolostones; minor cryptalgal dolostones, ooid dolograinstones and dolomitic quartz sandstones. Evaporties (principally anhydrite) common in maroon siltstones and interbeds, and some sandstones, particularly in lower half of formation. Numerous flat pebble breccias and other indications of erosive surfaces representing minor hiatuses.|
24641|Jinduckin Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Apparent conformity with Tindall Limestone below, conformable gradational contact with Oolloo Dolostone above. Where not overlain by Oolloo Dolostone, the unit is commonly unconformably overlain by Cretaceous sandstones (Petrel Formation, Bathurst Island Formation). In type section, lower boundary of unit is placed at top of highest limestone in the sequence; upper boundary is placed at top of highest finely laminated dolomitic sandstone-siltstone interbeds.|
24641|Jinduckin Formation|Structure and Metamorphism|Horizontal to very gently dipping; local fault-induced folding in northern Tipperary 1:100 0000.|
24641|Jinduckin Formation|Age reasons|Middle Cambrian to Early Ordovician.

24321|Johannsen Metagabbro|Name source|Johannsen's Phlogopite Mine - a well known locality in the area from which phlogopite was mined during World War II (GR 5751-079306). On the 1st Edition 1:100 0000 map (The Geology of the strangways Range Region), the form term 'Dyke Swarm' is added for clarification.|
24321|Johannsen Metagabbro|Unit history|Previously mapped by Wells & others (1968) as the undivided Arunta Complex.|
24321|Johannsen Metagabbro|Type section locality|The large mass of metagrabbro 2 km southwest of Johannsen's Phlogopite Mine is the type area.|
24321|Johannsen Metagabbro|Extent|The dykes radiate outwards as a series of prominent ridges from a large mass 2 km southwest of Johannsen's Phlogopite Mine.|
24321|Johannsen Metagabbro|Thickness range|Individual dykes are up to 100 m thick.|
24321|Johannsen Metagabbro|Lithology|The metagabbro is compositionally homogeneous and total rock analysis plot in the tholeiitic field of Irvine & Barager (1971), but it is olivine normative (Allen, 1976). The primary metamorphic assemblage is plagioclase-orthopyroxene-clinopyroxene- brown green hornblende-ilmenite; although hornblende or ilmenite may be absent. Retrograde metamorphism results in green hornblende, cummingtonite, blue-green hornblende, epidote and sphene. The primary rock type is coarse-grained.|
24321|Johannsen Metagabbro|Relationships and boundaries|The metagabbro dykes of the unit cut the Harry Anorthositic Gabbro and Erontonga metamorphics, and are themselves cut by the Gumtree Granite, pyroxene dolerite dykes (finer-grained) and coarse-feldspar pegmatite dykes.|
24321|Johannsen Metagabbro|Age reasons|Middle Proterozoic or older. The dykes are intruded parallel to F1 axial-plane fold traces which are thought to have formed during the main regional metamorphism of the Harry Anorthositic Gabbro. The metamorphism is dated at 1800 m.y. by the incremental 40Ar-39Ar method (Allen & Stubbs, in preparation), and so the intrusive age of the Johannsen Metagabbro is postulated to be the same.|
24321|Johannsen Metagabbro|Proposed publication|Stewart & others, in prep.|
24321|Johannsen Metagabbro|Comments|Remarks: The Gabbro is coarser-grained than the mafic gneisses in the Erontonga metamorphics, weathers spheroidally and is much more uniform in composition.|

75724|Kalkarindji Suite|Depositional environment|Continental extrusive rocks, high-level intrusive rocks.|
75724|Kalkarindji Suite|Relationships and boundaries|Antrim Plateau Volcanics and Helen Springs Volcanics unconformably overlie a variety of Palaeo- and Mesoproterozoic terranes. Youngest known underlying units are Neoproterozoic: Moonlight Valley Tillite, correlated with Marinoan glacial event (late Cryogenian-early Ediacaran) in Adelaide Rift, beneath Antrim Plateau Volcanics in AUVERGNE (Dunster et al 2000); and possibly younger (late Neoproterozoic; Rawlings et al 1997) Bukalara Sandstone beneath Antrim Plateau Volcanics in HODGSON DOWNS. Unconformably overlain generally by early Middle Cambrian (Ordian-early Templetonian; sequence 1 of Southgate and Shergold 1991) carbonate units: Tarrara Formation of Bonaparte Basin, Headleys Limestone of Ord Basin, Montejinni Limestone of Wiso Basin, Tindall Limestone of Daly Basin, Top Springs Limestone of northern Georgina Basin, Gum Ridge Formation of Barkly Sub-basin (central Georgina Basin) and Thorntonia Limestone of Undilla Sub-basin (central and eastern Georgina Basin). Unconformably overlain by later Middle Cambrian (early sequence 2) Wonarah Formation on Alexandria-Wonarah Basement High (central Georgina Basin) (Kruse 2003). In Purnululu National Park (DIXON, WA), Antrim Plateau Volcanics unconformably overlay the Albert Edward Group. In MOUNT RAMSAY, the Antrim Plateau Volcanics overlay the Lally Conglomerate and in GORDON DOWNS, Antrim Plateau Volcanics unconformably underlay the Windoo Sandstone. Milliwindi Dolerite and Mount Ramsay dolerite are interpreted as feeder dykes to the volcanic suites. Table Hill Volcanics are underlain by the Wahlgu Formation (conformably) and Lungkarta Formation, and overlain by the Paterson, Lennis and Wanna Formations. The Boondawari dolerite (MacDonald et al 2005) is a feeder dyke to the volcanic suites. The former Kulyong Formation in the Officer Basin, western-central South Australia (now superseded by the Table Hill Volcanics) is underlain by the Trainor Hill Sandstone and overlain by the Mount Chandler Sandstone. Colless Volcanics overlies the Thorntonia Limestone and Camooweal Dolostone and underlies the Mullera Formation.|
75724|Kalkarindji Suite|Age reasons|Radiometric dating provides an age of latest Early Cambrian (Early-Middle Cambrian boundary) and  includes: U-Pb SHRIMP zircon age of 513 +/- 12 Ma for the Milliwindi Dolerite, a feeder dyke for the Antrim Plateau Volcanics in Western Australia (Hanley and Wingate, 2000); U-Pb SHRIMP zircon age of 508 +/- 10 Ma for the Boondawari dolerite, a feeder dyke for the Table Hill Volcanics in the Officer Basin (MacDonald et al 2005); K-Ar whole rock age of 500 +/- 14 Ma for the Table Hill Volcanics ( reported in Veevers 2000); 40Ar/39Ar ages of 508 +/- 2 Ma and 505 +/- 2 Ma (average 507 Ma +/- 2 Ma ) for plagioclase feldspar separates for Helen Springs Volcanics and Antrim Plateau Volcanics in the Northern Territory (Glass and Phillips 2006); 40Ar/39Ar age of 505 +/- 3 Ma for the Table Hill Volcanics (Evins et al 2009). The age of the igneous event is therefore ca 510 Ma.|23/SEP/11
75724|Kalkarindji Suite|Correlations|Mount Wright Volcanics and Cymbric Vale Formation (both Gnalta Group) of Gnalta Shelf, western New South Wales; Truro Volcanics of Stansbury Basin, South Australia - all biostratigraphically dated as late Early Cambrian (Botomian stage of Siberia; Jago et al 1984, Jenkins and Hasenohr 1989, Gravestock 1995, Kruse and Shi in Brock et al 2000). Possibly Mooracoochie Volcanics (Gatehouse 1983), unconformable beneath Middle Cambrian Kalladeina Formation of Warburton Basin, South Australia.|
75724|Kalkarindji Suite|Comments|GA airborne magnetic data indicate that, in addition to their mapped outcrop areas, Early Cambrian volcanic rocks are extensive in the subsurface beneath Palaeozoic sedimentary basins of large parts of northern Australia. All of the included igneous units are genetically related as is confirmed by geochemical and isotopic evidence (Glass and Phillips 2006) The Kalkarindji Continental Flood Basalt Province constitutes the World's oldest known Phanerozoic Large Igneous Province (LIP).|

75947|Keri Metamorphics|Thickness range|Not known due to poor exposure|
75947|Keri Metamorphics|Lithology|Metamorphosed mafic/ultramafic assemblages (metamorphosed noritic cumulate, metapyroxenite and metaperidotite) and garnet-bearing mafic amphibolite (metaferrogabbro) (Glass 2007, 2010).|
75947|Keri Metamorphics|Relationships and boundaries|Contact relationships not observed, but possibly intrudes Welltree Metamorphics (Pietsch 1989).|
75947|Keri Metamorphics|Identifying features|Metamorphosed mafic/ultramafic assemblages are moderate to strongly foliated (typical mineral assemblages include tremolite, anthophyllite, actinolite and hornblende). Metaferrogabbro has distinctive large garnet porphyroblasts up to and greater than 10 mm in diameter, which commonly amalgamate to form linear segregations in an amphibole-rich groundmass.|
75947|Keri Metamorphics|Structure and Metamorphism|Amphibolite-facies metamorphism|
75947|Keri Metamorphics|Age reasons|Carson et al (2009) determined a weighted mean 207Pb/206Pb SHRIMP date of 1860 +/- 6 Ma (95% confidence level) for a garnet-bearing mafic amphibolite, which is interpreted to represent the magmatic crystallisation age for this sample.|
75947|Keri Metamorphics|Correlations|None known.|
75947|Keri Metamorphics|Alteration and Mineralisation|Abundant fibrous amphibole (tremolite-actinolite) is interlaminated with chlorite and is most likely replacement product of primary orthopyroxene. Uralitic amphibole is most likely derived from granular clinopyroxene. Residual partly seriticised (+/- clinozoisite) platy plagioclase (up to 2 mm in size) has in part been overprinted by recrystallised amphibole. No known mineralisation.|
75947|Keri Metamorphics|Geophysical Expression|Appears to be associated with a magnetic high in northwestern corner of Reynolds River 1:100 000 mapsheet, which extends slightly into adjoining mapsheets. No observable radiometric or gravity response.|
75947|Keri Metamorphics|Geochemistry|Metamorphosed noritic cumulate is typically low Ti and highly magnesian. Metaferrogabbro is metamorphosed plagioclase-pyroxene cumulate with very high FeO (18.8-23.2 wt%; Glass 2010).|

24347|Kurinelli Sandstone|Name source|Kurinelli gold mine, GR 036130, Hatches 1:100 000 Sheet area, Frew River 1:250 000 Sheet area.|
24347|Kurinelli Sandstone|Type section locality|From GR 030206 (base), 2.5 km NNW of Kurinelli mine (latitude 20o38'00"S, longitude 135o02'00"E) in Hatches 1:100 000 Sheet area, where the formation is conformable on Rooneys Formation, west to GR 992204 in Davenport Range 1:100 000 Sheet area, and SW through GR 960185 to GR 939147 (top), where it is overlain conformably by Taragan Sandstone. The type section thus transects some 11.5 km of low ridges containing gently to moderately-dipping Kurinelli Sandstone, which here is about 3000 m thick, and consists of fine to medium, thin to thick bedded arenite with some medium to coarse and gritty interbeds in upper part and laminated siltstone and claystone near base.|
24347|Kurinelli Sandstone|Extent|Throughout the Davenport Province - eastern and central parts of Bonney Well, southwestern part of Frew River, northwestern part of Elkedra, and northeastern part of Barrow Creek 1:250 000 Sheet areas.|
24347|Kurinelli Sandstone|Thickness range|0 to at least 3000 m.|
24347|Kurinelli Sandstone|Lithology|Brown weaathering fine to medium, clay-grain rich (?kaolinised feldspar) arenite, strongly cross-bedded in places, thin to medium-bedded, some medium to coarse and gritty interbeds of lithic arenite, particularly in upper part; minor quartzosed arenite, siltstone, claystone, slate and intermediate to felsic volcanics. Interlaminated claystone, siltstone and fine arenite form mappable member (Endurance Sandstone Member) near base in southern Hatches 1:100 000 Sheet area, and non-bedded quartzose arenite forms mappable member (Warnes Sandstone Member) in upper part of the formation in southern Hatches, southeastern Davenport Range (Bonney Well 1:250 000 Sheet area) and northeastern Murray Downs (Barrow Creek 1:250 000 Sheet area) 1:100 000 Sheet areas.|
24347|Kurinelli Sandstone|Relationships and boundaries|Conformable on, and interfingers with, Rooneys Formation, Epenarra Volcanics and Edmirringee Volcanics; overlain conformably by, and probably also interfingers with, pebbly arenite and conglomerate of Taragan Sandstone; overlain conformably by more quartzose arenite of Unimbra Sandstone and unconformably by Cambrian beds. Intruded by sill-like bodies of granophyre and dolerite/gabbro, and by plutons of Devils Marbles Granite and unnamed granite.|
24347|Kurinelli Sandstone|Age reasons|Younger than 1870 m.y. - U-Pb zircon age of volcanics in the Warramunga Group unconformably underlying the Hatches Creek Group. Older than 1640 m.y. - Rb-Sr whole-rock age of granite intruding the Hatches Creek Group.|
24347|Kurinelli Sandstone|Comments|Remarks: Part of the Ooradidgee Subgroup of the Hatches Creek Group. Includes the Endurance Sandstone Member and Warnes Sandstone Member, two lensoid units of distinctive, readily mappable lithology.|

28264|Lake Surprise Sandstone|Unit history|Mapped previously ;(Milligan et al., 1966) as Dulcie Sandstone.|
28264|Lake Surprise Sandstone|Type section locality|The interval from 3 m to 62 m in stratigraphic drillhole BMR Lander River 1, latitude 20o31'S, longitude 133o30'E, Lander River 1:250 000 Sheet area SF53-1 (Kennewell & Huleatt, in prep.). Lithology uniform throughout type section, consisting of sandstone, white to light brown, very fine to medium grained, well rounded, well sorted, commonly bimodally sorted with silt and clay matrix in prts, even texture. Top eroded, overlain by aeolian sand; basal contact determined only from cuttings. One core, and cuttings at 3 m intervals from this section, are stored at the BMR Core and Cuttings Laboratory, Fyshwick.|
28264|Lake Surprise Sandstone|Extent|Poorly exposed over 15 000 km2 in a west northwest trending area extending across the central part of Lander River Sheet area and the northeast part of Mount Solitaire Sheet area.|
28264|Lake Surprise Sandstone|Thickness range|59 m in type section. Seismic surveys (Kennewell, Mathur and Wilkes, in prep.) suggest very gentle folding and thickening of the Lake Surprise Sandstone to a maximum thickness of approximately 200 m.|
28264|Lake Surprise Sandstone|Lithology|Sandstone, white, grading to dark brown if ferruginised, very fine to medium grained, well rounded, well sorted, commonly bimodally sorted with silt and clay matrix in parts, silicified and/or ferruginised in some outcrops, generally cross bedded, low angle cross bedding common, slight to extreme slumping in some outcrops.|
28264|Lake Surprise Sandstone|Relationships and boundaries|Overlain by Cainozoic units. Overlies the Lothari Hill Sandstone, the Point Wakefield Beds, the Hanson River Beds, and crystalline rocks of the Arunta Block. In BMR Lander River 1, the underlying Hanson River Beds are dark red-brown in the 10 m immediately beneath the Lake Surprise Sandstone suggesting that the sandstone was deposited either disconformably or unconformably on a weathered surface. The Lake Surprise Sandstone overlies dolomites of both middle Arenig and late Arenig or early Llanvirian age (E Druce, BMR, pers. comm. 1976), indicating an unconformable basal contact.|
28264|Lake Surprise Sandstone|Age reasons|No fossils found; overlies the Hanson River Beds, hence it must be post Ordovician (early Llanverian) in age. At latitude 20o34'S, longitude 133o27'E, the Lake Surprise Sandstone is intensely ferruginised, indicating deposition before the development of the laterite soil profile, i.e. before the range late Early Cretaceous to early Miocene.|
28264|Lake Surprise Sandstone|Comments|Notes: Although mapped previously as Dulcie Sandstone, no conclusive evidence of correlation with this rock unit of the Georgina Basin has been found.       Kennewell P.J., Mather S.P., Wilkes P.G., 1977|

24355|Laughlen metamorphics|Relationships and boundaries|The unit overlies unassigned biotite gneiss (pC) of the southern Ankala Block, and is in faulted contact with the rocks of the Wigley Block.|
24355|Laughlen metamorphics|Age reasons|Middle Proterozoic or older. Lithologically correlated with the Chewings Range Quartzite, and both units are assigned  to Division 3 of the Arunta Block. The Laughlen metamorphics are therefore inferred to be older than 1700 m.y. and may be older than 1800 m.y.|

10289|Ledan Schist|Relationships and boundaries|Unconformably overlies the Delmore Metamorphics. Contains a basal conglomeratic unit; minor units of the Delmore Metamorphics being truncated by the unconformity. May unconformably overlie Delny gneiss, but contact is not exposed. Granite south of Lily Bone intrudes the Ledan Schist. The granite foliation parallels the axial-plane schistosity in the Ledan Schist suggesting that folding was synchronous with granite intrusion.|
10289|Ledan Schist|Correlations|Tentative correlations: Grouped with the Utopia Quartzite as equivalents of the Hatches Creek Group and the Reynolds Range Group, in which case it may be Early Proterozoic in age. A K/Ar date of 1532 m.y. was obtained on muscovite from the Ledan Schist and 1537 m.y. was obtained on a pegmatite that intrudes the Ledan Schist. The dates are minima and are considered to be somewhat reset.|

31284|Liverpool Breccia|Geomorphic expression|Circular ridge 1.6 km in diameter.|
31284|Liverpool Breccia|Type section locality|SE exterior side of ring, from base to top of ridge (lat. 12 deg.

31284|Liverpool Breccia|Extent|Exposed around the rim of the Liverpool impact crater.|
31284|Liverpool Breccia|Thickness range|About 50 m (Guppy et al., 1971).|
31284|Liverpool Breccia|Lithology|Breccia of sandstone blocks derived from the underlying sandstone of the Kombolgie Subgroup.  The clasts range in size from a few millimetres to 7 m, and are mostly angular and roughly equant, although some are elongate.|
31284|Liverpool Breccia|Depositional environment|The breccia was produced by bolide impact.|
31284|Liverpool Breccia|Relationships and boundaries|Unconformably overlies Kombolgie Subgroup sandstone, with an irregular contact having several metres of relief.  Undeformed sandstone in outcrops in the centre of the ring, interpreted as Cretaceous in age (Guppy et al., 1971), has no exposed contact with the unit, but would overlie it on the presumption that the breccia extends in the subsurface to cover the initial floor of the structure.|
31284|Liverpool Breccia|Identifying features|The breccia lithology, and its distribution in a circular ridge, are unique in the region.|
31284|Liverpool Breccia|Structure and Metamorphism|Usually unbedded.  Where crude bedding is visible, it lies within a few degrees of horizontal.|
31284|Liverpool Breccia|Age reasons|The age is between that of the Palaeoproterozoic Kombolgie Subgroup and the interpreted Cretaceous sandstone in the centre of the crater (Guppy et al., 1971).  The well-preserved rim suggests that it was buried before much erosion could take place, so formation of the structure in the Cretaceous is likely.|

10668|Lothari Hill Sandstone|Unit history|Included in Chewings' (1931) Winnecke Creek Tableland Formation. Milligan, Smith, Nichols and Doutch (1966) included this rock unit in the Merrina Beds.|
10668|Lothari Hill Sandstone|Type section locality|In stratigraphic drill lhole BMR Green Swamp Well 4, latitude 19o16'S, longitude 132o39'E, from the surface to a depth of 94 metres (Kennewell & Huleatt, in prep.). One core, and cuttings at 3 m intervals are available from this section and are stored at the BMR Core and Cutting Laboratory, Fyshwick, ACT. The section consists almost entirely of sandstone, quartzose, white, weathering brown, fine-grained, subrounded to subangular, dolomitic in parts, with sparse beds of claystone, white, soft, silty, fissile, tight, between 5 and 20 m, and rare beds of claystone, silty, dark brown or white, and chert, grey, cryptocrystalline, harad, and dolomite, white, micro-crystalline, hard throughout remainder of section.|
10668|Lothari Hill Sandstone|Extent|The unit is poorly exposed over the north, central and southwest of Tanami East SE 52-16, the extreme south of Winnecke Creek SE 52-12, and the north half of Green Swamp Well SE 53-13 1:250 000 Sheet areas. Its southward extent into the Lander Trough on Lander River SF 53-1, 1:250 000 Sheet area, is not known.|
10668|Lothari Hill Sandstone|Thickness range|Maximum recorded thickness is 94 metres in BMR Green Swamp Well 4.|
10668|Lothari Hill Sandstone|Lithology|Sandstone, typically red-brown in outcrop (probably due to lateritization), white in parts, poorly sorted, finely grained, clayey, grades to clayey siltstone and claystone in parts; contains vertical burrows, mudcracks, and although typically thickly bedded and even textured, some low angle crossbedding is present.|
10668|Lothari Hill Sandstone|Relationships and boundaries|Conformably overlies the Hooker Creek Formation with a gradational contact, as shown by cuttings from BMR stratigraphic drilling, and as exposed at Lothari Hill. Unconformably overlain by the Point Wakefield Beds in BMR Green Swamp Well 3, by the Lake Surprise Sandstone in the southwest of Tanami East Sheet area (contact not observed) and by the Buchanan Hills Beds at Buchanan Hills; upper contact eroded and covered by Cainozoic deposits throughout most of the Wiso Basin|
10668|Lothari Hill Sandstone|Age reasons|Unfossiliferous; conformably overlies the Lower Middle Cambrian (Ordian) Hooker Creek Formation (J. Gilbert-Tomlinson, BMR pers. Comm. 1976). Unconformably overlain by the lower Middle Cambrian (Templetonian) Point Wakefield Beds (P. Jell, Univ. Qld pers. comm., 1976). Hence the Lothari Hill Sandstone is of lower Middle Cambrian age, probably deposited conformably and gradationally on the Hooker Creek Formation during the Ordian stage of Cambrian time.|

22242|Maidjunga Member|Name source|Maidjunga River, a south-flowing fresh-water tributary of the Koolatong River which runs adjacent to the eastern margin of the Mitchell Range, Arnhem Bay and Blue Mud Bay 1:250 000 scale mapsheet areas.|
22242|Maidjunga Member|Unit history|Previously undifferentiated Fagan Volcanics. Equates roughly to the informal "basal member A" of Plumb and Roberts (1922).|
22242|Maidjunga Member|Geomorphic expression|Forms recessive valleys adjacent to the upstanding ridges of the enclosing sandstone units. Tors and weathered boulders are the common outcrop pattern.|
22242|Maidjunga Member|Type section locality|The best probably complete sections of porphyritic rhyolite and associated volcaniclastic rocks are in the Blue Mud Bay map sheet area, where access is restricted to helicopter. The type section follows the Koolatong River near latitude 13o04'45"S, longitude 135o32'20". This section runs between AMG NF589537 (base of section) and NF581543 (top boundary stratotype). The basal contact here is unexposed and may be intrusive. Consequently, a lower boundary stratotype is defined to the north at NF680840 (Arnhem Bay map sheet area), where it is a sinuous and scalloped boundary between coarse-grained lithic sandstone of the Ritarango Formation and mildly foliated porphyritic rhyolite of the overlying Maidjunga Member (Fagan Volcanics).  Reference Areas: A volcaniclastic sequence exposed near the type section at NF600600 is nominated as a reference area. There are no complete or unfaulted sections in the Arnhem Bay map sheet area, where road access is good. However, given the uniformity of rock-type throughout the Mitchell Range, two reference areas of incomplete or fault-bounded outcrop are nominated. Area one comprises coarsely-porphyritic rhyolite in the core of a broad syncline on trhe eastern margin of the range near NF680840 (also the lower boundary stratotype). Area two is outcrop of mildly deformed possibly intrusive or fault-bounded rhyolite adjacent to the Gove-Bulman road near NF700960.|
22242|Maidjunga Member|Extent|Outcrop occurs in two distinct areas in the northern and southern parts of the Mitchell Range, in both Arnhem Bay and Blue Mud Bay 1:250 0000 scale mapsheet areas. The areas are separated by a considerable distance (~30 km)|
22242|Maidjunga Member|Thickness range|150-250 m, but is absent around NF490540 due to intraformational erosion.|
22242|Maidjunga Member|Lithology|Undeformed to mildly deformed, coarsely-porphyritic K-feldspar-quartz-albite rhyolite, associated with minor fine- to coarse-grained volcaniclastic sandstone and mudstone, and rare dolerite. Ripples and trough cross-beds are common, while synsedimmentary deformation structures are rare in the sedimentary rock. Rocks arae locally sheared.|
22242|Maidjunga Member|Depositional environment|Sedimentary volcaniclastic facies are fluvial. Igneous rocks are interpreted as flows and shallow sills.|
22242|Maidjunga Member|Relationships and boundaries|Lies with conformity or mild disconformity on the coarse-grained siliciclastic rocks of the Ritarango Formation, and in turn is overlain conformably by the sandstone-mudstone succession of the Sheridan Member. The basal contact surface is often very sinuous, scalloped or crenulated in a north-south orientation on a scale of 10-100 m. This feature is most obvious on the aerial photograph. It is ascribed to either; a manifestation of the structural contrast between sandstones of the Ritarango Formation and porphyritic rhyolite of the Maidjunga Member; or syndepositional loading; or an irregular erosive (disconformity) surface. This problem remains unresolved. The upper boundary with the Sheridan Member in many areas takes the form of a conformable volcanic-epiclastic relationship, where porphyritic rhyolite is overlain by progressively more mature volcaniclastic sandstone. In the vicinity of NF490540 (Blue Mud Bay), the Maidjunga Member is absent (by erosion) and the Ritarango Formation is disconformably overlain by the Sheridan Member of the Fagan Volcanics.|
22242|Maidjunga Member|Age reasons|Palaeoproterozoic (Statherian). Well constrained by single grain SHRIMP U-Pb geochronological techniques at ~1710 Ma (Rawlings and others, in prep.). The rhyolite porphyry sample used was collected from outcrop at NF694959.|
22242|Maidjunga Member|Correlations|Rawlings and others (in prep.) and Rawlings (1994) suggest correlation with the upper parts of the Tawallah and Katherine River Groups in the southern and western McArthur Basin respectively. More locally, it correlates to felsic igneous successions of the Spencer Creek Group in northeastern Arnhem Bay and tentatively with the Gadabara Volcanics in the eastern Blue Mud Bay mapsheet area. These correlations are based on geochemical, petrological, lithostratigraphic and geochronological constraints, and the physical form of igneous units.|

25203|Manton Group|Name source|After Manton Dam, 22 km NNE of Batchelor, Northern Territory.|
25203|Manton Group|Unit history|Referred to as Namoona Group (Crick 1987, Pietsch and Stuart-Smith 1987, Needham et al 1988).|
25203|Manton Group|Constituents|Beestons Formation and Celia Dolostone.|
25203|Manton Group|Extent|The Manton Group occurs around the southern and eastern margins of the Rum Jungle Dome and the eastern margin of the Waterhouse Dome in NOONAMAH, REYNOLDS RIVER and BATCHELOR 1:100 000 sheets.|
25203|Manton Group|Relationships and boundaries|Beestons Formation unconformably overlies Rum Jungle Complex. Celia Dolostone is unconformably overlain by Crater Formation conglomerate and arkose. Lower boundary is recognised as the change from Rum Jungle Complex granite, granite-gneiss or schist to quartz conglomerate of the Beestons Formation. Upper boundary is recognised by sudden change from Celia Dolostone (commonly not exposed) to ridge-forming arkose and conglomerate of the Crater Formation.|
25203|Manton Group|Age reasons|Younger than 2507 Ma, age of the youngest detrital zircons in the Beestons Formation (NTGS unpublished data), and older than 1885 Ma, age of the South Alligator Group (Needham et al 1988).|
25203|Manton Group|Correlations|Possibly equivalent to Namoona Group in central Pine Creek Orogen.|
25203|Manton Group|Comments|The name Manton Group was previously used to group Beestons Formation and Celia Dolostone, but was not formally defined (Pietsch 1983, Pietsch 1985). Subsequent publications (eg Pietsch and Stuart-Smith, 1987) classified Beestons Formation and Celia Dolostone as Namoona Group, based on a tentative correlation with the Masson Formation in the central PCO. No geochronological data are available to determine whether the Masson Formation and Manton Group are time equivalents. From its distribution around the Rum Jungle Complex, the Manton Group appears to have formed in a shallow water environment restricted to the margins of a basement high formed by the Rum Jungle Complex.|
27478|Mapata Gneiss|Name source|After Mapata Creek which is centrally placed with respect to the outcrop areas. Mapata Creek is a tributary of Bundey Creek in the eastern part of the Alcoota 1:250 000 Sheet area, SF53-10, Australian Map Grid.|

27478|Mapata Gneiss|Lithology|Biotite-quartz feldspar gneiss typically with quartzo-feldspathic segregations, biotite schist, amphibolite. All exposed in type area.|
27478|Mapata Gneiss|Relationships and boundaries|Possibly conformably overlies the Kanandra Granulite which is of higher metamorphic age. The boundary with the Kanandra Granulite is probably isoclinally folded. Possibly unconformably beneath Delny Gneiss as boundary corresponds to a marked regional change in lithology. The Mapata Gneiss is intruded by the Crooked Hole, Copia, and Ida Granites and probably by the Mount Suan Granite.|
27478|Mapata Gneiss|Identifying features|Distinguished from Delny Gneiss principally by presence of migmatic appearance and quartzofeldspathic segregations and lack of muscovite clots. Distinguished from Chiripee Gneiss by lack of garnet. Distinguished from Kanandra Granulite principally in containing a very much smaller proportion of mafic rock.|
27478|Mapata Gneiss|Age reasons|Probably older than the Mount Suan Granite dated by Pb/Sr (T.T.) at 1690 m.y. Criley 1961 and pers. comm. in Compston and Arriens, 1968).|

25731|Mordor Igneous Complex|Name source|Mordor Pound (GR 5751-440090) in which the Complex crops out, Laughlen 1:100 000 Sheet area.|
25731|Mordor Igneous Complex|Unit history|The name Mordor Complex has been used by Langworthy & Black (1978), but Mordor Igneous Complex is preferred because it has been used previously by Stewart & Warren (1977) and Warren (1978). The title 'Igneous Complex' also helps to differentiate it from various metamorphic complexes in the same area.|
25731|Mordor Igneous Complex|Type section locality|Reference area: The most unusual rock type in the complex is a phlogopite-rich peridotite and this is well exposed at a conical hill at GR 465069 in the Laughlen 1:100 000 Sheet area. The best exposures of the various rock types may be observed near the north/south traverse base line graded by CRA from GR 472052 476091.|
25731|Mordor Igneous Complex|Extent|The Complex crops out over 36 km2 inside Mordor Pound, a region of low relief surrounded by sheer cliffs of Heavitree Quartzite.|
25731|Mordor Igneous Complex|Lithology|The Complex consists of ultrabasic to intermediate igneous rocks unusually enriched in larage ion lithophile elements such as Ba, Rb, Sr, and K. These were unusually abundant in the primary magma, and led to derivatives enriched in phlogopite, hyalophane, and Ba orthoclase, such as phlogopite-peridotite, pyroxenite, shonkinite, melamonzonite, monzonite, syenite, and pegmatite. Carbonate veins associated with the Complex appear to be of secondary origin, by leaching and precipitation from groundwater, not of carbonate origin. Further details are given by Langworthy & Black (1978).|
25731|Mordor Igneous Complex|Relationships and boundaries|Intrudes the Jennings Granitic Gneiss.|
25731|Mordor Igneous Complex|Age reasons|Late Proterozoic. 1210 +/- 90 m.y. by Rb-Sr dating on whole-rocks and minerals (Langworthy & Black, 1978).|

12356|Morphett Creek Formation|Type section locality|Between GRs 407893 and 403891 in the Tennant Creek 1:250 000 Sheet area. A generalised section has at its base 16 m of ferruginous quartz sandstone with jasperoidal cement. This is overlain by 60 m of flaggy to blocky feldspathic quartz sandstone, with ripple marks, mudclasts and cross-bedding. On this rests a lens of boulder conglomerate up to 14 m thick; boulders are of orthoquartzite, quartz and pebbly sandstone. The sandstone and conglomerate are succeeded by 220 m of interbedded red and white shale and micaceous siltstone, some quartz siltstone and feldspathic quartz sandstone, in generaly flaggy to laminated. Minor ironstone and calcareous beds are intercalated in this sequence at intervals, typically of aboaut 15 to 25 m.|
12356|Morphett Creek Formation|Extent|This formation of easily eroded soft shale and siltstone, has only limited outcrop, in the central part of the Whittington Range and in some areas on the northern side of the Short Range.|
12356|Morphett Creek Formation|Thickness range|From 2500 to 4800 m.|
12356|Morphett Creek Formation|Lithology|The lower part of the formation consists of fissile to floggy, and locally massive and thick-bedded, feldspathic sandstone with thin conglomerate locally above it and several bands of rounded quartz pebbles near the base. Ripple marks, cross-beds and shale clasts are common. This is overlain by floggy to laminated shale and siltstone, with minor interbedded quartz siltstone and feldspathic quartz sandstone. The lower 100 to 150 m of the feldspathic sandstone is ferruginous and has a jasperoidal cementing material. The rock has a deep brown colour and is readily recognised on airphotos as a dark horizon immediately overlying the Whittington Range Volcanics. The siltstone and shale are soft and poorly exposead.|
12356|Morphett Creek Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Conformably overlies the Whittington Range Volcanics and is conformably overlain by the Short Range Sandstone.|

24389|Mount Airy Orthogneiss|Type section locality|Point 292000E, 7521000N, in Warimbi Hills, 7.5 km SW of Pine Hill H.S., ion SE part of Reynolds Range 1:100 000 Sheet area. Hilly terrain of augen granite, foliated NW, cut by second 'strain-slip' foliation N/S; dykes of microgranite contain xenoliths of augen granite.|
24389|Mount Airy Orthogneiss|Extent|Between Reynolds and Anmatjira Ranges in SE part of Reynolds Range 1:100 000 Sheet and SW part of Tea Tree 1:100 000 Sheet areas.|
24389|Mount Airy Orthogneiss|Lithology|Coarse foliated augen granite, grading to massive porphyritic granite in placeas. Some tourmnaline closts. An elongate irregular body of porphyritic microgranite between SW margin of Mt Airy Orthogneiss (Pgr) and Lander Rock beds and Mt Thomas Quartzite is interpreted as a chilled border phase of the Mount Airy Orthogneiss and labelled Pgr1 - an unnamed member of the Mount Airy Orthogneiss.|
24389|Mount Airy Orthogneiss|Relationships and boundaries|Intrudes Lander Rock beds, adjoins and deforms Mount Thomas Quartzite, but latter is not actually breached by Mt Airy Orthogneiss. Is faulted against Yaningidjara Orthogneiss and Weldon metamorphics (q.v.). Intruded by dykes of aplite, metabasic rock, and by quartz veins and dykes of microgranite. Adjoins and probably intruded by Harverson Granite (q.v.), as latter is not intruded by basic dykes.|
24389|Mount Airy Orthogneiss|Identifying features|Reason for proposed name: a large and distinctive body of granite, and different in mineralogy and texture from other nearby or adjoining granites.|
24389|Mount Airy Orthogneiss|Age reasons|Not isotopically dated. Younger than Lander Rock beds and Mount Thomas Quartzite (Early Proterozoic or older). Probably same age as neighbouring Napperby Gneiss on S. side of Reynolds Range, and hence probably late Early or early Middle Proterozoic.|

12476|Mount Baldwin Formation|General description|The Mount Baldwin Formation of Smith (1964) is here redefined to exclude the archaeocyathan dolomite and overlying rocks in the type section and elsewhere. It is also noted that the upper sandstone in the type section of the Mount Baldwin Formation as defined by Smith (1964) is a fault repetition of the Mount Baldwin Formation sensu stricto. In many parts of the Huckitta 1:250 000 Sheet area the Elkera Formation (former upper Grant Bluff Formation) has been mis-mapped as Mount Baldwin Formation. Smith's (1964) type section X4 is retained; this is section 13 of Walter (1979). In this section the formation is 280 m thick. Its base is defined as the base of the yellow-green pebbly sandstone overlying the light grey sandstone of the Elkera Formation. This seems to be the same position selected by Smith (1964). The top of the formation is placed at the base of the archaeocyathan dolomites above the ridge-forming sandstones of the formation.|

12596|Mount Cornish Formation|General description|The Mount Cornish Formation of Smith (1964) is here redefined to exclude the lower 26 m in the type section; i.e. to exclude the basal sandstone and dolomite, which are here assigned to the Yackah Beds. The original type section is retained, but is extended stratigraphically higher through an area of poor outcrop, giving the formation a thickness of 680 m without the top being exposed (Walter, 1979). The section runs from 4 km WSW to 48 km SSW of Mt Cornish, Huckitta 1:250 000 Sheet area. The base of the formation is placed at the base of the lowermost diamictite.|
24395|Mount Davenport Diamictite Member|Name source|The name is derived from Mount Davenport at the south-western end of the Treuer Range (6824:5264) on the Mount Doreen 1:250 000 Sheet area (SF 52-12).|
24395|Mount Davenport Diamictite Member|Type section locality|The type section, WX-2, is located in the eastern slopes of the Naburula Hills (7385:5336) and is the same as the type section of the Mount Doreen Formatio0n.|
24395|Mount Davenport Diamictite Member|Extent|The Mount Davenport Diamictite Member occurs in sporadic outcrops along the northern margin of the Ngalia Basin as far west as Albinia Springs and as far east as Naburula Hills.|
24395|Mount Davenport Diamictite Member|Thickness range|The thickness in the type section is 77.4 m. An incomplete sequence of 61 m was measured in a neighbouring section. Most other exposures are incomplete so that no information is available on the regional variation in thickness of the member.|
24395|Mount Davenport Diamictite Member|Lithology|In the type section the Member consists of a polymictic boulder conglomerate with erratics up to 4 m across of predominantly metamorphic and igneous rock types, of which granite and quartzite are the most common; faceting and striations are common. The matrix is mostly a blue-green, some red-brown and green poorly sorted siltstone with abundant angular quartz and rock fragments. A few thin lenses of sandstone and sandy dolomite, and pebbly sandstone occur near the base of the member. Lithological variations: In some places outside the type section the large striated erratics are absent and the member consists of dolomitic pebble (commonly chert) conglomerate.|
24395|Mount Davenport Diamictite Member|Relationships and boundaries|The Davenport Diamictite Member is conformably overlain by the Wanapi Dolomite Member and overlies the Rinkabeena Shale, probably disconformably. In places it is overlain with an angular unconformity by the Mount Eclipse Sandstone.|
24395|Mount Davenport Diamictite Member|Identifying features|Reason for proposed name: The Member comprises an easily recognised part of the Mount Doreen Formation which has been described but not previously named.|
24395|Mount Davenport Diamictite Member|Age reasons|The lithology and superposition of the member indicates that it is late Proterozoic in age. It can be correlated with the Olympic Member of the Pertatataka Formation in the Amadeus Basin. In the Vaughan Springs Syncline it may unconformably overlie the Albinia Formation.|

12639|Mount Doreen Formation|Identifying features|The original definition of the Mount Doreen Formation is here amended because it is now believed that a disconformity is present in its lower part. The formation was described (Wells et al., 1972) as consisting of red shale at the top followed by thin beds of pink dolomite, diamictite, and green shale at the base. The disconformity occurs between the diamictite and underlying green shale. The shale is here defined as the Rinkabeena Shale and the name Mount Doreen is retained for the upper part of the sequence.  The lower boundary of the formation is taken as the contact between diamictite of the Mount Doreen Formation with green shale of the Rinkabeena Shale.|12/APR/12

13012|Mount Partridge Group|General description|The name was defined by Needham and others (1980) as containing the Mundogie Sandstone, Mount Hooper Sandstone, Wildman Siltstone and Acacia Gap Sandstone Member, and Nourlangie Schist. Owing to uncertainty in correlation between the Nourlangie Schist and other units in the group, and the fact that the Nourlangie Schist is essentially a metamorphic unit, this formation was dropped from the Mount Partridge Group by Needham (1984). Recorrelation of units in the Rum Jungle area and recognition of a regional unconformity within the now no longer used "Batchelor Group", has resulted in the addition of the Crater Formation and Coomalie Dolomite to the Mount Partridge Group (Needham & Stuart-Smith, in prep.).  Crick (in prep.) redefines the pelitic sequence in the Rum Jungle area stratigraphically between the Coomalie Dolomite and Acacia Gap Quartzite Member as the Whites Formation; this sequence was previously correlated with the Masson Formation of the Namoona Group by Needham & others (1980). The Mundogie Sandstone has been extended to include similar rocks in the West Alligator River area which were differentiated by Needham & others (1980) as the Mount Hooper Sandstone (Needham & Stuart-Smith, 1984).  Thus the Mount Partridge Group as redefined contains five formations: Coomalie Dolomite, Crater Formation, Mundogie Sandstone, Whites Formation, Wildman Siltstone.|12/APR/12

27067|Mount Shepherd Rhyolite Member|Extent|Exposed over about 11 km2 around Mount Shepherd, north of Dorothy Creek.|
27067|Mount Shepherd Rhyolite Member|Thickness range|<110 m.|
27067|Mount Shepherd Rhyolite Member|Lithology|Cream-purple banded fine siliceous massive rhyolite. In places flow-banded and flow-top breccia. Weathers buff or brown-orange, and from a distance commonly looks like Kombolgie Formation sandstone, especially when cliff-forming.|
27067|Mount Shepherd Rhyolite Member|Relationships and boundaries|Rests on Tollis Formation with marked angular unconformity. Overlain by Kombolgie Formation with apparent conformity. Forms a member within the Plum Tree Creek Volcanics and appears to lie at or near the top of the formation. Relationships with Plum Tree Creek Volcanics lithologies north of Mount Shepherd not clear owing to Cainozoic cover, but it must either be a lateral equivalent of these rocks (ignimbrite and basalt) forming a steep-sided flow, or overlie them with an irregular contact. The absence of Plum Tree Creek Volcanics south of Mount Shepherd suggests the latter. The rock type is distinct in the region and boundaries should be sharp. The unit may correlate with other unnamed rhyolite bodies in the Mount Felix/Mount Lambell and Eva Creek headwaters areas, about 20 and 60 km east on Eva Valley and Waterhouse 1:100 000 Sheets respectively (also within Plum Tree Creek Volcanics).|

Its unconformable position beneath Kombolgie Formation (dated 1648 +/- 29 m.y., Rb/Sr whole rock + mineral separates isochron, Page, Compston & Needham, 1980), and the unconformabale position of other units within this group (Edith River Group) over 1780 m.y.-granites in the Stow Sheet indicate an age for the group of ~1700 +/- 50 m.y.  (Age of granite inferred from ages of similar granites in Pine Creek Geosyncline reported by Page, Compston & Needham, 1980, and Riley, 1980).|

28815|Mount Thomas Quartzite|Unit history|Mapped and referred to as Giles Quartzite and Ironbark Silts by Australian Geophysical (1967); included in 'Metasediments and metamorphics of uncertain origin' by Evans & Glikson (1969); mapped as 'Precambrian quartzite' by Wells & others (1971).|
28815|Mount Thomas Quartzite|Type section locality|AX-1, 3 km east of Mount Thomas; base at 5453-775315, top at -763313 not measured.|
28815|Mount Thomas Quartzite|Extent|Entire length of the Reynolds Range, in Aileron, Tea Tree, and Reynolds Range 1:100 0000 Sheet areas: also Giles Range, in the Reynolds Range and Denison 1:100 000 Sheet areas; also Wabudali Range, Mount Theo 1:250 000 Sheet area.|
28815|Mount Thomas Quartzite|Thickness range|850 m in type section (excluding microgranite sills); 235 m in northwest part of Reynolds Range; about 550 m in southeast part of Range. All figures are estimates from airphoto measurements and dip information.|
28815|Mount Thomas Quartzite|Lithology|At the type section, unit consists mostly of pinkish-brown thin-bedded silicified sandstone which is weakly schistose, cross laminated, and contains a small amount of detrital muscovite. Two sills of retrogressively metamorphosed microgranite of the Warimbi Schist intrude the lower part of the type section, and a third sill overlies the top of the section. Two interbeds of greenish-grey, weakly cleaved silstone with andalusite porphyroblasts are present, one immediately above the lower sills of microgranite, the other near the top of the section. In the southeast of the Reynolds Range, the sequence is generally similar, but the proportion of siltstone and shale is greater. In the northwest of the Range, the unit begins with a few metres of basal conglomerate or pebbly arkose, overlain by white to pink orthoquartzite (about 100 m), and then by blue hematite quartzite (about 125 m); shale is absent. The basal conglomerate is separated from the quartzite by the retrogressively lmetamorphosed microgranite sill of the Coniston Schist.|
28815|Mount Thomas Quartzite|Relationships and boundaries|Overlies Lander Rock beds with an angular unconformity; conformable overlain by and interfingers with Pine Hill Formation. Intruded by orthoschist sills of Coniston and Warimbi Schists; adjoins and probably intruded by Yakalibadgi Microgranite and Mount Airy Orthogneiss; ;intruded by Napperby Gneiss.|
28815|Mount Thomas Quartzite|Age reasons|Older than 1800-1500 m.y. preliminary Rb-Sr isochron date on Napperby Gneiss (L P Black, BMR, personal communication, 1974); hence Middle Proterozoic or older.|

24417|Namatjira Formation|Name source|Namatjira's Copper Prospect 20 km east of Areyonga Mission. The prospect is a very minor non-economic occurrence of azurite and malachite that is dispersed through the Arumbera Sandstone and the Namatjira Formation. It was also referred to as the Areyonga Copper Deposit (Bell, 1953) having been discovered by Albert Namatjira. It is labelled as Namatjira's Copper Prospect on the BMR 1:250 000 Geological Map Sheet of Henbury - Northern Territory (132o22'48", 24o07'57").|
24417|Namatjira Formation|Unit history|Unit not previously recognised.|
24417|Namatjira Formation|Type section locality|It occurs at 132o24'15", 24o07'56" and is 50 m thick. The base is the first occurrence of carbonate lenses in the sandstone at the top of the Arumbera Sandstone. The top is a disconformity in a zone of no outcrop between the end of its dip slope and the poorly outcropping Chandler Formation.|
24417|Namatjira Formation|Extent|The unit is confined to the eastern end of the Gardiner Range Anticline in the Amadeus Basin.|
24417|Namatjira Formation|Thickness range|It ranges from >100 m in the eastern nose of the anticline (132o25'38" 24o08'15") to where it pinches out 10 km to the west (132o22'12" 24o07'32"), 2 km west of Namatjira's Copper Prospect.|
24417|Namatjira Formation|Lithology|It is a mixed carbonate and clastic sequence which is cyclical. The base has cycles comprising brown sandstone, buff to cream carbonate mudstone and shale which grades vertically into cycles of grey oolitic grainstone, carbonate mudstone and shale. The latter contains very minor sand stringers. The carbonate is completely dolomitised.|
24417|Namatjira Formation|Relationships and boundaries|It is vertically gradational with the underlying Arumbera Sandstone and laterally interfingers with the Arumbera Sandstone to the west. It is disconformably overlain by the Chandler Formation.|
24417|Namatjira Formation|Age reasons|It contains no diagnostic fauna (only ;small domal stromatolites) but is considered to be equivalent to the Arumbera Sandstone in the Gardiner Range which is thought to be Late Proterozoic to Early Cambrian in age (Hamp, 1984).|

13724|Namoona Group|Name source|The name was defined by Needham & others (1980) as containing the Masson Formation, Cahill Formation and Stag Creek Volcanics.  Owing to correlation of the upper part of the Cahill Formation with a unit belonging to another group (viz: Mundogie Sandstone of the Mount Partridge Group) the Cahill Formation is no longer placed in the Namoona Group or any other group (Needham 1984).  Recorrelation of units in the Rum Jungle area and recognition of a regional unconformity within the now no longer used "Batchelor Group" has resulted in the addition of the Celia Dolomite and Beestons Formation to the Namoona Group (Needham & Stuart-Smith, in prep.). Thus the Namoona Group as redefined contains the four formations: Beestons Formation, Celia Dolomite, Masson Formation and Stag Creek Volcanics.|

24427|Newhaven Shale Member|Name source|The anme of the member is derived from Newhaven Homestead in the southern part of the Ngalia Basin (7224 : 4856) on the Mount Doreen (SF/52-12) 1:250 000 Sheet area.|
24427|Newhaven Shale Member|Type section locality|The type section, WX-2, is located in the eastern part of the Naburula Hills (7385 : 5337). The type section comprises a uniform sequence of red shale.|
24427|Newhaven Shale Member|Extent|The Newhaven Shale lMember crops out in the eastern part of the Naburula Hills and the western part of the Wanapi Hills. Outcrops are mostly incomplete and sporadic; they are confined to the central northern part of the Ngalia Basin on the Mount Doreen 1:250 000 sheet area.|
24427|Newhaven Shale Member|Thickness range|The member is 17 m thick in the type section in the Naburula Hills, 16 m of the Newhaven Shale Member was measured in a nearby section but no estimate of regional variation is possible because of its poor exposure and because its upper boundary is marked by an angular unconformity; it appears to maintain this order of thickness in the known exposures.|
24427|Newhaven Shale Member|Lithology|The member consists predominantly of red shale, but in places the topmost beds are yellow brown and fawn and are probably leached beneath the unconformity.|
24427|Newhaven Shale Member|Relationships and boundaries|The Newhaven Shale Member in the type section, is unconformably overlain by the Ordovician Djagamara Formation and conformably overlies the Wanapi Dolomite Member of the Mount Doreen Formation.|
24427|Newhaven Shale Member|Identifying features|Reason for proposal of name: The shale is an easily reacognisable marker unit above the Wanapi Dolomite Member at the top of the Mount Doreen Formation. The shale has been described but not previously named.|
24427|Newhaven Shale Member|Age reasons|Stratigraphic relationships and regional correlations suggest that the Newhaven Shale Member is Proterozoic in age. It is lithologically similar to red shale that occurs in the Pertatataka Formation in the Amadeus Basin (Wells et al., 1970).|

24428|Newlands Volcanics|Unit history|Corresponds to part of the Arabulja Volcanics in Blake & others (1982 - BMR Report 239), Blake & Wyche (1983 - BMR Record 1983/18), and Blake & others (1983 - BMR 83).|
24428|Newlands Volcanics|Type section locality|In the eastern part of Elkedra Pound, 36 km west of Elkedra homestead (latitude 21o11'00"S, longitude 135o28'00"E) from GR 110645 to GR 115592, Elkedra 1:100 000 Sheet area, Elkedra 1:250 000 Sheet area. Here main rock types of the formation are well exposed: partly recessive pink and grey felsic lava, ignimbrite, and minor interlayered feldspathic and volcaniclastic arenite, and a bank of ridge-forming quartz arenite. A sill of porphyritic mafic granophyre, probably comagmatic with adjacent volcanics, is also present. At GR 115592 the formation is overlain by ridge-forming Coulters Sandstone. The base of the formation is not exposed in the type section, which is probably at least 1000 m thick.|
24428|Newlands Volcanics|Extent|Extensive outcrops in the southeastern part of the Davenport Province, mainly in northwest Elkedra and southwest Frew River 1:250 000 Sheet areas.|
24428|Newlands Volcanics|Thickness range|0 to probably more than 2000 m.|
24428|Newlands Volcanics|Lithology|Generally recessive dacitic to rhyolitic ignimbrite and subordinate lava containing abundant phenocrysts of tabular sodic plagioclase up to 5 mm long +/- partly resorbed quartz, together with small ferromagnesian clots (mainly biotite aggregates), in a fine-grained, commonly dark grey, groundmass; minor bedded tuff, ashstone, agglomerate, siltstone, shale, and partly ridge-forming quartzose to feldspathic or lithic (volcaniclastic) arenite and quartzite. The volcanic rocks are commonly cleaved and much altered.|
24428|Newlands Volcanics|Relationships and boundaries|Conformable on Unimbra Sandstone in southeast and conformable on and probably interfingers with Yeeradgi Sandstone in north, but basal contacts generally poorly exposed; overlain conformably and possibly disconformably by Coulters Sandstone and unconformably by Cambrian and Mesozoic? strata; intruded by sill-like bodies of porphyritic mafic granophyre probably related genetically to the volcanics.|
24428|Newlands Volcanics|Age reasons|Younger than 1870 m.y. - U-Pb zircon age of volcanics within the Warramunga Group unconformably underlying the Hatches Creek Group. Older than 1640 m.y. - Rb-Sr whole-rock age of granite intruding the Hatches Creek Group.|

25343|Nimbuwah Complex|Comments|Definition: The name was first used by Rix (1965) and re-defined by Needham & others (1974), who recognised four zones. The zones were, from the centre of the unit outwards, the Granitoid Core, Migmatite Zone, Lit-par-lit Gneiss Zone, and Transitional Zone, and were all thought to represent progressive migmatisation of metasediments, to granitoid rocks in the centre. Page & others (1980) determined a meta-igneous origin for the Granitoid Core and Migmatite Zones, so Needham (1984a and b) separated them from the demonstrably metasedimentary Lit-par-lit Transitional Zones, for which he re-instated the name Myra Falls Metamorphics.  Needham and Stuart-Smith (in press) describe the variation from migmatitic to homogeneous granitoid, implicit in the distinction between the Migmatite Zone and Granitoid Core, as apparent only; the entire granitoid mass of the complex is migmatitic, but in places - particularly in the north - less compositional difference between leucosome and melanosome render the migmatitic nature of the rocks difficult to observe. Consequently no subdivision of the complex is now recommended, except for unnamed tonalites differentiated in the south and some locally distinct granite bodies (Needham 1984a and b).  Changed parts of the definition are as follows: Distribution, Type area, Rock Types, Relationships, Age evidence.|11/OCT/11

68735|No Mans Sandstone Member|Name source|From No Mans Creek, which drains the western Carrara Range in southeastern MOUNT DRUMMOND.|06/FEB/12
68735|No Mans Sandstone Member|Unit history|Previously included in the Constance Sandstone on the first edition of MOUNT DRUMMOND by Smith and Roberts (1963), and on the Carrara Range region 1:100 000 sheet by Sweet (1984).|06/FEB/12
68735|No Mans Sandstone Member|Geomorphic expression|Forms a single low rocky ridge or narrow plateau up to 0.5 km wide.|06/FEB/12
68735|No Mans Sandstone Member|Type section locality|Three kilometres east-southeast of Mitchiebo Waterhole, continuing on from Top Lily Sandstone Member type section. Base is at latitude 18o39'25"S longitude 137o7'33"E (724230E 7935810N), and top is 450 m north, latitude 18o39'10"S longitude 137o7'33"E (724230E 7936260N).|06/FEB/12
68735|No Mans Sandstone Member|Extent|Forms a west to west-southwest-trending outcrop belt in southeastern and central Mount Drummond, from the headwaters of Maloney Creek in the east, to 7 km southwest of Mitchiebo Waterhole in the west.|06/FEB/12
68735|No Mans Sandstone Member|Thickness range|130 m in type section, and up to 200 m to the east. Thins to the north across Mitchiebo Fault, and only 50 m thick 17 km to the northwest in the Playford Anticline; absent in outcrops of Playford Sandstone further north and west.|06/FEB/12
68735|No Mans Sandstone Member|Lithology|Very coarse-grained to granule and pebbly, quartz-rich sandstone, and minor fine-grained sandstone with coarse to pebbly lags. Strongly trough cross bedded on medium to large scale throughout.|06/FEB/12
68735|No Mans Sandstone Member|Depositional environment|Braided fluvial and possibly shallow marine (intertidal).|06/FEB/12
68735|No Mans Sandstone Member|Relationships and boundaries|Lower contact, with the Top Lily Sandstone Member, is sharp and probably erosive at the type section. It is placed at the change from fine-grained pink lithic sandstone to coarse-grained and granular to pebbly quartz sandstone. The upper contact is also abrupt - sandstone beds become thinner upwards, and are overlain by mudstone of the Crow Formation. Both contacts are conformable. Parent units: Playford Sandstone, Wild Cow Subgroup, South Nicholson Group.|06/FEB/12
68735|No Mans Sandstone Member|Age reasons|A maximum age of 1591+/-10 Ma for the Playford Sandstone as a whole, based on reworked tuffaceous material from the underlying Lawn Hill Formation (Page et al 2000) in LAWN HILL, or 1595+/-6 Ma based on tuffs in the Lawn Hill Formation in the same area (Page and Sweet 1998). The interpreted age range of 1500-1400 Ma for the South Nicholson Group is based on its correlation with the Roper Group of the southern McArthur Basin (Dunn et al 1966; Plumb & Derrick 1975). Ages of 1492+/-4 and 1493+/-4 Ma for tuffaceous material from the Mainoru Formation in the Roper Group (Jackson et al 1999) provides the most reliable estimate for the age of the lower part of that Group, and hence for the Playford Sandstone and its members.|06/FEB/12
68735|No Mans Sandstone Member|Correlations|None known, but it is likely that sandstones low in the Renner Group (Hussey et al 2001) and the Roper Group (Jackson et al 1999) are in part correlative, given the overall correlation between these groups.|06/FEB/12

14422|Nyanantu Formation|Lithology|At type section: coarse-grained, cross-bedded, lithic sandstone with numerous pebble and cobble horizons. Thick beds of conglomerate near the base with distinctive porphyritic rhyolite clasts. Elsewhere: conglomeratic throughout with an abundance of rhyolitic clasts, except in northern parts of its range where these clasts are rare. Thin beds and veins of fine-grained rhyolite occur in the sequence at NC895655.|
14422|Nyanantu Formation|Depositional environment|Probably deposited in a fluvial and alluvial fan environment.|
14422|Nyanantu Formation|Relationships and boundaries|At the type section it overlies red sandstones assigned to ther Warramana Sandstone with a possibly disconformable or conformable relationship (contact not well exposed). The contact is picked at the incoming of conglomerate. On the Mount Young 1:250 0000 scale map sheet area it disconformably overlies the Warramana Sandstone and Gold Creek Volcanics, or lies above a non-outcropping unit inferred to be the Tanumbirini Rhyolite. At the type section it is overlain with probable disconformity by the Masterton Sandstone. The Masterton Sandstone is clearly distinguished by its much paler colour and clean (non-lithic) character. No assigned to any group.|
14422|Nyanantu Formation|Age reasons|Statherian based on the 1713 +/- 6 Ma age of the underlying Tanumbirini Rhyolite (Haines and others, in press).|

14496|Oenpelli Dolerite|Thickness range|Range <250 m. Arcuate ridges probably are exposed rims of roughly ellipsoidal basins which may be part of a large undulating sheet of dolerite, or mark individual lopoliths, the latter being supported by a general thickening of the dolerite towards the centres of the basins. There are also occasional narrow dykes of Oenpelli Dolerite (porphyritic olivine dolerite) >10 cm with sharp margins.|12/APR/12
14496|Oenpelli Dolerite|Lithology|An approximately symmetrically differentiated dolerite intrusive sill. Central part is igneously laminated ophitic dolerite often displaying local ophitic gabbro, granophyric dolerite, granophyre and syenite differentiates as large lens-shaped bodies.

14610|Oorabra Arkose|Identifying features|The Oorabra Arkose as named by Joklik (1955) and formalised by Smith (1964) as a member of the Elyuah Formation is now considered to lie disconformably and locally with slight angular unconformity beneath the former upper member of the Elyuah Formation (Walter, 1979). The angular unconformity has been recognised by photo-interpretation of the eastern Mopunga Range, in the newly named Mopunga Trough. The base of the redefined Elyuah Formation is marked by the base of sandstone and pebbly arkose.  The Oorabra Arkose is here raised to the status of a formation. It is discontinuous between depositional troughs but for convenience the same name is applied in each trough in the Huckitta area. The name is not used for the arkose at Poomingie Waterhole on the Alcoota 1:250 000 Sheet area because of some uncertainty about the correlation of that unit. The type section is that selected by Smith (1964), "half a mile" NNE of Grant Bluff, Huckitta 1:250 000 Sheet area, where the formation is 25 m thick without the top being exposed.|

24454|Peppimenarti Granite|Name source|Name derived from Peppimenarti Aboriginal Settlement, Daly River Aboriginal Reserve. Peppimenarti is situated within the outcrop area, and translates as "Big Rock".|
24454|Peppimenarti Granite|Unit history|Previously undivided from the "Litchfield Complex", a blanket term for all the granitoids of the Litchfield Province (Morgan, 1972).|
24454|Peppimenarti Granite|Type section locality|As above, centred around 14o08'S, 130o04'E.|
24454|Peppimenarti Granite|Extent|The granitoid crops out over about 3 km2 on the north side of Tom Turners Creek, in an area bounded by the AMG co-ordinates 154375, 177375, 154365, 177363. A smaller outcrop (250 m2) is  south of Tom Turners Creek at AMG coordnates 138345.|
24454|Peppimenarti Granite|Lithology|Ranges in composition from adamellite to granite; also includes aplitic and pegmatitic phases. The adamellite is a coarse grained, equigranular rock consisting of plagioclase, K-feldspar, quartz and biotite. The granite is fine to medium grained and consists of quartz, K-feldspar and plagioclase in an interlocking granular mosaic. The granitoid is pervasively altered, with sericite and chlorite forming the dominant secondary mineral phases.|
24454|Peppimenarti Granite|Relationships and boundaries|Overlain unconformably by quartzarenites of the Middle Proterozoic Moyle River Formation. Intruded by the Middle (Late?) Proterozoic Murrenja Dolerite, although this relationship is interpreted from other evidence as it is not clearly demonstrated in the field. Host rocks obscured by cover.|
24454|Peppimenarti Granite|Age reasons|U-Pb dating of both the Wagait and Murra-Kamangee Granaitoids puts this event at 1840-1850 Ma (page and others, 1984).|
24454|Peppimenarti Granite|Correlations|The Peppimenarti Granite is separated from the Early Proterozoic Murra-Kamangee Granodiorite to the east and the Wagait Granite to the north by Younger sedimentary sequences. It has the same field relationships with other units as the two abovementioned granitoids. Geochemically, the Peppimenarti Granite is similar to the Wagait Granite. Therefore all three granitoids are believed to have crystallised during the same intrusive event.|

24455|Perenti Metamorphics|Type section locality|Generally along a traverse 2 km west of Tower Rock, from GR NR067148 (latitude 22o28'S, longitude 135o04'E) to GR NR067156 on Huckitta. The structure and hence sequence of the unit is not defined and the top and base are not known.|
24455|Perenti Metamorphics|Extent|On Huckitta, near western edge of sheet area and on Alcoota, near eastern boundary of sheet name. :Mostly as outcrops isolated from each other by granite.|
24455|Perenti Metamorphics|Lithology|Quartzofeldspathic gneiss, felsic granulite, quartz-sillimanite-biotite-cordierite rocks, calc-silicate rock, metadolerite. Felsic granulite consists of orthoclase, antiperthite and orthopyroxene; calc-silicate rocks consist of diopside, calcic plagioclase and quartz with lesser orthopyroxene, sphene and apatite; metadolerite is fine-grined, consists of hornblende-orthopyroxene-clinopyroxene and has a granulite texture. Generally consists of mineral assemblage with granulite metamorphic grade, later partly retrogressed to amphibolite facies and subsequently hydrated at a still lower grade.|
24455|Perenti Metamorphics|Identifying features|Outcrops of generally felsic gneiss or granulite mostly associated with or occurring as rafts within the Mount Swan Granite. Pronounced layering is present in most outcrops.|
24455|Perenti Metamorphics|Age reasons|The age is unknown but is inferred to be early Proterozoic and older than about 1.8 Ga.|
24455|Perenti Metamorphics|Correlations|No definite correlate known but assigned to Division 2 of the Arunta orogenic domain because of its dominantly felsic composition.|

15094|Pertatataka Formation|Identifying features|The Pertatataka Formation of Prichard & Quinlan (1962) is redefined here because the original definition has not been followed by subsequent authors (apparently unknowingly). To revert to the original definition now would cause considerable confusion. The type section as originally designated (Section W of Ellery Creek) is retained. The top of the Pertatataka Formation is taken as the base of the Julie Formation (former Julie Member), i.e., at the incoming of the first dolomite or limestone. The base of the formation is put at the top of the Pioneer Sandstone. The formation is predominantly red and green siltstone, shale and feldspathic sandstone.|

26103|Pine Hill Formation|Type section locality|AX-2, 3 km east of Mount Thomas, immediately above type section of Mount Thomas Quartzite, in Reynolds Range. Base at 5453-761313, top at -756311, Not measured.|
26103|Pine Hill Formation|Extent|Entire length of Reynolds Range, in Reynolds Range, Tea Tree, and Aileron 1:100 000 Sheet areas; Giles Range, in Reynolds Range and Denison 1:100 000 Sheet areas; also in Wabudali Range Mount Theo 1:250 000 Sheet area.|
26103|Pine Hill Formation|Thickness range|570 m in type section (estimated from airphoto measurement and dip information); apparently fairly constant along entire Reynolds Range.|
26103|Pine Hill Formation|Lithology|In type section, weakly cleaved red-brown to grey-green shale, siltstone, and fine-grained silty sandstone, grading to slate, with porphyroblasts of andalusite. A distinctive pair of marker beds occurs near the middle of the section, comprising a white orthoquartzite below, and blue hematite quartzite above, the two separated by a few metres of shale. Two thin sills of microgranite retrogressively metamorphosed to orthoschist of Warimbi Schist are present in lower part of section.|
26103|Pine Hill Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Conformably overlies and interfingers with Mount Thomas Quartzite; no overlying formation known. Includes conformable Algamba Dolomite Member and Woodforde River beds. Intruded by sills of retrogressively metamorphosed microgranite of Warimbi Schist, and by Napperby Gneiss.|
26103|Pine Hill Formation|Age reasons|Older than 1800 to 1500 m.y. age of Napperby Gneiss; preliminary Rb-Sr isotopic date on slate from northwest part of Reynolds Range gives time of metamorphism as 1500 m.y. (L P Black, BMR, personal communication, 1977). Hence Formation is Middle Proterozoic or older.|

15306|Plain Creek Formation|Lithology|Cycles of shale or laminated siltstone, grading up through laminated and thin-bedded very fine-grained lithic sandstone to thin to medium beds of very fine or fine-grained sandstone. Rarely, medium to coarse-grained sandstone, some with mudstone intraclasts, is present in the upper parts of cycles. Thin to thick graded sandstone and cobble to boulder-bearing pebbly mudstone interbeds in northern outcrops.|06/FEB/12
15306|Plain Creek Formation|Lithology|The unit is characterised by micaceous siltstone and shale, with at least 3 interbeds of fine to medium, well sorted, quartz-rich sandstone. The formation thickens eastwards and contains a higher proportion of sand in the sequence. It is virtually non-dolomitic in all areas.|06/FEB/12

15306|Plain Creek Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Overlies Shady Bore Quartzite, apparently conformably - the boundary is sharply gradational over a few metres. The upper contact, with the Lawn Hill Formation, is invariably concealed but is concordant and presumed to be conformable. Parent unit: McNamara Group.|06/FEB/12
15306|Plain Creek Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Both the lower and upper contacts of the Plain Creek Formation are conformable; they are marked by a rapid transition from siltstone to sandstone (base) and sandstone to siltstone (top). The sandstone defining the base of the formation is a massive, medium-grained orthoquartzite unit about 50 m thick in the type section.|06/FEB/12

37727|Playford Sandstone|Geomorphic expression|A series of low sandstone ridges with intervening valleys underlain by finer-grained components of the formation.|06/FEB/12
37727|Playford Sandstone|Type section locality|In the area 4 km southeast of Mitchiebo Waterhole, MOUNT DRUMMOND, and is easily accessible from the Mittiebah-Wangalinji access road.

37727|Playford Sandstone|Lithology|Very coarse-grained to granule quartz-rich sandstone at base, overlain by interbedded laminated shale with thin-bedded siltstone and very fine-grained lithic sandstone, coarse-grained quartz sandstone interbeds. Thick to very thick bedded, large-scale cross bedded, very fine- to fine-grained, well-sorted lithic sandstone, minor ferruginous sandstone, ironstone, and stromatolitic carbonates, and strongly trough-cross-bedded, fine- to coarse-grained quartz-rich sandstone with granule to pebble lags.|06/FEB/12
37727|Playford Sandstone|Depositional environment|Shallow marine shelf, mainly tide-dominated and nearshore; minor deeper water, storm-dominated facies.|06/FEB/12
37727|Playford Sandstone|Relationships and boundaries|Lies with angular unconformity on the Widdallion Sandstone Member of the Lawn Hill Formation 6.5 km SW of Mitchiebo Waterhole (717310E 7932906N), and disconformably on the same formation over a strike length of some 50 km to the east of the Mitchiebo Waterhole outcrops. The contact is placed at the change from highly lithic, dark-coloured sandstone below, to light-coloured coarse to granule-rich or pebbly, sublithic sandstone (Playford). The formation is overlain conformably in virtually all outcrops by the Crow Formation. Where seen the contact is a rapid transition over a few metres into fine-grained siliciclastic rocks. Parent units: Wild Cow Subgroup, South Nicholson Group.|06/FEB/12
37727|Playford Sandstone|Age reasons|A maximum age of 1591+/-10 Ma, based on reworked tuffaceous material from the underlying Lawn Hill Formation (Page et al 2000) in LAWN HILL, or 1595+/-6 Ma based on tuffs in the Lawn Hill Formation in the same area (Page and Sweet 1998). The interpreted age range of 1500-1400 Ma for the South Nicholson Group is based on its correlation with the Roper Group of the southern McArthur Basin (Dunn et al 1966; Plumb & Derrick 1975). Ages of 1492+/-4 and 1493+/-4 Ma for tuffaceous material from the Mainoru Formation in the Roper Group (Jackson et al 1999) provides the most reliable estimate for the age of the lower part of that Group, and hence for the Playford Sandstone or its members.|06/FEB/12
37727|Playford Sandstone|Correlations|None known, but it is likely that sandstones low in the Renner Group (Hussey et al 2001) and the Roper Group (Jackson et al 1999) are in part correlative, given the overall correlation between these groups.|06/FEB/12

Unconformable beneath Keepera Group: Boko Formation and Central Mount Stuart Formation in BARROW CREEK and MOUNT PEAKE.|
37959|Plenty Group|Age reasons|Stratigraphic position, lithological similarity and mutual occurrence of stromatolite Acaciella australica (Walter 1972, Walter et al 1979) permit correlation with Bitter Springs Formation of Amadeus Basin and confirm an immediate post-800 Ma Cryogenian age. Stratigraphic position beneath the fossiliferous latest Neoproterozoic Central Mount Stuart Formation, together with fault-associated quartz veining (indicating a tectonic imprint and therefore apparently favouring an age early in Georgina Basin developmental history) suggested to Haines et al (1991) a Neoproterozoic or older age for the Amesbury Quartzite.|

15428|Poodyea Formation|Extent|Southwest part of Glenormiston, southeast party of Tobermory, and western area of Mt Whelan 1:250 000 Sheets. The unit occurs within the Toko Range and to the south as narrow discontinuous belts.|
15428|Poodyea Formation|Lithology|Boulder conglomerate, generally unconsolidated and comprising well-rounded clasts of quartzite, Carlo Sandstone, milky quartz; cross-stratified sandy conglomerate and pebbly sandstone with parting lineation. The cross-strata comprise medium- to large-scale cosets of low, medium and high-angle trough lamination.|
15428|Poodyea Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Disconformably overlies Early to Middle Ordovician Carlo Sandstone, Ethabuka, Mithaka and Nora Formations, Lower to Middle Devonian Cravens Peak Beds, and possibly (although not observed) Jurassic-Cretaceous Hooray Sandstone. Unknown but presu;med lateral transition with the Tertiary Austral Downs Limestone. Overlain by unconsolidated Quarternary Units.|
15428|Poodyea Formation|Age reasons|Presumed Tertiary on the following basis as there is no known fauna: 1) The physiographic occurrence in the Toko Range is in canyons incised below the Mesozoic level; 2) Outcrop trends indicate pre-existing valleys down the synclinal axis. These valleys are present and further enhanced in the Carlo Sandstone within the Toko Range but there is inverted relief over the Ethabuka Sandstone and Mithaka Formation terrain; 3) The Unit is locally overlain by Quaternary cover.|

26321|Possum Creek Charnockite|Relationships and boundaries|Intrudes Tyson Creek granulite (q.v.). Adjoins Aloolya Gneiss (q.v.) but no intrusive relationship seen. Foliation in Charnockite is drag-folded at one contact with Aloolya Gneiss suggesting that Charnockite is deformed by and therefore older than Aloolya Gneiss. However, 1.5 m from contact into Charnockite, vergence of dragfolds reverses across a pegmatite dyke, and so both sets of drag-folds could have been formed by intrusion of pegmatite alone. Retrogressively metamorphosed near Aloolya Gneiss, but this could be deuteric alteration during its own cooling.|23/NOV/06
26321|Possum Creek Charnockite|Identifying features|Reason for Proposed Name: A very distinctive and easily recognised rock-type which forms several mappable bodies in Anmatjira Range.|
26321|Possum Creek Charnockite|Age reasons|No isotopic date available. Younger than Tyson Creek granulite, probably older than Aloolya Gneiss and therefore older than Anmatjira Orthogneiss (1642 +/- 100 m.y.). Probably Early Proterozoic, and must be late Early Proterozoic or early Middle Proterozoic (Early Carpentarian) if Tyson Creek granulite is Early Proterozoic (as supposed, but not proved).|

15661|Pungalina Member|Geomorphic expression|Lower unit is generally resistant, forming gently-dipping karstically-weathered mesas. Upper unit is recessive and poorly exposed.|
15661|Pungalina Member|Type section locality|Around 16o30'S, 137o30'E (Robinson River sheet), adjacent to the Calvert River. The lower sandstone part of the member is best exposed at 765160E 8175260N (16o29.5'S, 137o29'E), while the upper mudstone-rich part is exposed nearby at 765130E 8172230N (16o29.5'S, 137o31'E).   REFERENCE AREAS/SECTIONS: 795120E 8099030N to 794720E 8098900N, near Redbank Mine (Calvert Hills sheet), is designated as a reference section. A conformable gradation with the upper Echo Sandstone at 792940E 8099840N is a good reference for the upper boundary. Another two useful reference sections are the drillhole intersections: (i) 680-745m in DDH Wearyan 1 drilled at 656320E 8139820N (north of Foelsche Inlier, Bauhinia Downs); and (ii) 0-88m in DD95GC007 drilled at 784810E 8163630N (Sandy Creek in northern Selby 1:100 000 sheet). Drillcore is available for inspection at the NTGS Core Library, Darwin.|07/FEB/11
15661|Pungalina Member|Extent|Exposed on the Wearyan Shelf (Plumb & Wellman, 1987), being constrained mostly to the Calvert Hills & Robinson River 1:250 000 sheet areas. It also includes a western extension into the Foelsche Inlier on Bauhinia Downs sheet.|
15661|Pungalina Member|Thickness range|0-120 m.|
15661|Pungalina Member|Lithology|Lower unit of pink, medium- to coarse-grained lithic sandstone with locally developed pebbly or cobbly sandstone near the base, containing abundant clasts of rhyolite, basalt and mudstone. Sandstone is cross-bedded with symmetrical to slightly asymmetrical ripples, current lineation and rare mudclasts. Local poorly stratified boulder conglomerate at the base of this member represents a talus deposit from nearby Hobblechain Rhyolite. Upper unit of red/brown dolomitic mudstone and fine-grained sandstone with halite casts, hummocky cross-stratification, load casts, tool marks and flute moulds.|
15661|Pungalina Member|Depositional environment|Lower unit was deposited in a high-energy shallow water environment. Upper part was deposited in oxic restricted shallow water bodies, influenced by storm action.|
15661|Pungalina Member|Relationships and boundaries|Local lateral facies variant of the lower Echo Sandstone. Conformably to unconformably overlies the Gold Creek Volcanics and sometimes the Wollogorang Formation (e.g., Camp Creek area). When unconformable, this boundary exhibits a low-angle (up to 10o) erosional truncation of the underlying units. Locally conformably overlies the Hobblechain Rhyolite, and the lower conglomeratic Pungalina Member is an epiclastic/talus apron of the rhyolite. Overlain conformably and gradationally by the upper Echo Sandstone, the contact marked by a transition from red/brown mudstone and fine-grained sandstone into white medium-grained sandstone.|
15661|Pungalina Member|Age reasons|Palaeoproterozoic. Constrained by SHRIMP U-Pb zircon dates of ~1725 Ma for underlying Hobblechain Rhyolite and ~1640 Ma for the overlying middle McArthur Group (Page and Sweet, 1998).|
15661|Pungalina Member|Correlations|Warramana Sandstone in the Batten Fault Zone.|
15661|Pungalina Member|Comments|The Pungalina Member was initially assigned by Roberts et al. (1963) and Yates (1965) as a member of the `Masterton Formation', which included various sedimentary and volcanic units on the Wearyan Shelf. Jackson et al. (1987) suggested that the Pungalina Member interfingered with the Gold Creek Volcanics and was overlain unconformably by the `Masterton Sandstone' (now upper Echo Sandstone) and should therefore be a member of the Gold Creek Volcanics. The current study has shown that these relationships are incorrect and that the Pungalina Member has greater affinity with the conformably overlying upper Echo Sandstone, and should thus be returned as a member of this formation. By this definition, the Pungalina Member also includes proximal rhyolite talus conglomerate that was assigned by Ahmad & Wygralak (1989) to the Hobblechain Rhyolite.|

16107|Rinkabeena Shale|Name source|The name of the formation is derived from Rinkabeena Bore in the eastern part of the Ngalia Basin (2130 : 4868) on the Napperby 1:250 000 sheet area (SF/53-9).|12/APR/12
16107|Rinkabeena Shale|Type section locality|The type section of the Rinkabeena Shale is located in the headwaters of Patmungala Creek at 7387 :5334 to 73 : 5332. The type section consists predominantly of shale with some interbeds of siltstone. The formation is in places slightly calcareous especially towards its base.|12/APR/12
16107|Rinkabeena Shale|Extent|Outcrops extend intermittently around the eastern closure of the Naburula Syncline and follow approximately the trend of the Patmungala and Gum Creeks in their headwaters. The Rinkabeena Shale is known from a shallow stratigraphic drillhole in the Davis Gap Area, and it probably occurs in the Vaughan Springs Syncline but outcrops here are extremely poor to be certain of its identification.|12/APR/12
16107|Rinkabeena Shale|Thickness range|The Rinkabeena Shale is about 100 m thick in the type section. The shale is not sufficiently well exposed to obtain any information on regional changes in thickness.|12/APR/12
16107|Rinkabeena Shale|Lithology|The formation consists of a very uniform sequence of green shale with subordinate interbeds of siltstone.|12/APR/12
16107|Rinkabeena Shale|Relationships and boundaries|In the type section the Rinkabeena Shale is overlain, probably disconformably, by the Mount Davenport Diamictite Member and conformably overlies the Naburula Formation. In the Vaughan Springs Syncline it may also unconformably overlie the Albinia Formation.|12/APR/12
16107|Rinkabeena Shale|Identifying features|Reason for Proposal of Name: A mappable unit of shale that was originally included in the basal part of the Mount Doreen Formation. It is probably separated from the Mount Davenport Diamictite Member of the Mount Doreen Formation by a disconformity.|12/APR/12
16107|Rinkabeena Shale|Age reasons|Stratigraphic relationships and regional correlations suggest that the Rinkabeena Shale is Proterozoic in age. It is correlated with the basal part of the Pertatataka Formation (as defined by Wells et al. 1970) in the eastern part of the Amadeus Basin.|12/APR/12

29328|Ritarango Formation|Name source|Ritarango Gap (latitude 12o52'S, longitude 135o36'E), a topographical saddle in the middle part of the Mitchell Range, Arnhem Bay 1:250 000 scale map sheet area.|
29328|Ritarango Formation|Unit history|Comprises the upper half of the "Mitchell Range Formation" of Crohn (1954) and "Ritarango beds" of Dennut (1965) and Plumb and Roberts (1992).|
29328|Ritarango Formation|Geomorphic expression|Forms resistant and upstanding ridges, which are poorly vegetated.|
29328|Ritarango Formation|Type section locality|The entire Mitchell Range was nominated as a reference area for the "Ritarango beds" by Plumb and Roberts (1992), but no boundary stratotypes were nominated. A type section for the redefined Ritarango Formation is the semi-complete north-south section through the axis of a large syncline on the eastern margin of the Mitchell Range at latitude 12o50'E, longitude 135o37'E. The base of the section is AMG NF6=40772 and the top is NF680840 (also the top boundary stratotype). The base of the formation is not exposed and consequently no lower boundary stratotype is nominated. The top boundary stratotype (NF680840) is the sinuous and scalloped contact between coarse-grained lithic sandstone of the Ritarango Formation and mildly foliated porphyritic rhyolite of the overlying Maidjunga Member (Fagan Volcanics).  Reference area: Outcrop along the Koolatong River near AMG NF600530 is representative of the formation to the south.|
29328|Ritarango Formation|Extent|Small area bordering on southern Arnhem Bay and northern Blue mud Bay 1:250 000 scale map sheet areas. Along with the Dhunganda Formation, comprises the core of the Mitchell Range, centred on Ritarango Gap.|
29328|Ritarango Formation|Thickness range|500-1500 m.|
29328|Ritarango Formation|Lithology|Mildly deformed fine- to very coarse-grained (partly conglomeratic) lithic sandstone with minor red-brown mudstone and volcaniclastic sandstone. Sandstone is white to maroon, with local rounded to angular clasts (granules, pebbles and rarely cobbles) of mainly massive quartz, with lesser lithified sandstone, quartzite, felsic igneous (volcanic) rock and mudstone. It is medium- to very thick-bedded with large scale trough cross-bedding and rarely ripples. Rocks are commonly diffusely bedded or sheared.|
29328|Ritarango Formation|Depositional environment|Based on limited palaeoenvironmental information, a shallow water fluvial setting appears the most likely depositional environment for the sandstones. Some of the finer-grained sediments may have been deposited in a floodplain or delta situation, complementary to the coarser-grained higher-energy fluvial (braided?) sediments.|
29328|Ritarango Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Middle formation of the Donydji Group. Lies unconformably? on the Dhunganda Formation and conformably below the Fagan Volcanics. The lower contact was not observed, but appears to have been intruded by a major dolerite sill along much of its length. However, it clearly corresponds to a significant change in rock-types and structural characteristics, possibly related to a sedimentological break and period of tectonism. The Ritarango Formation comprises considerably coarser-grained and less-mature siliciclastic rocks with an apparently lower degree of deformation. The underlying Dhunganda Formation is made up of strongly-deformed interlayered sandstone, mudstone, volcaniclastic and bimodal igneous rocks. The boundary with the overlying Maidjunga Member of the Fagan Volcanics is conformable or "mildly" disconformable. The contact surface is often very sinuous, scalloped or crenulated in a north-south orientation on a scale of 10-100 m. This feature is most obvious on the aerial photography near the top stratotype. It is ascribed to either; a manifestation of the structural contrast between sandstones of the Ritarango Formation and porphyritic rhyolite of the Maidjunga Member, or syndepositional loading; or an irregular erosive (disconformity) surface. This problem remains unresolved. In the vicinity of NF490540 (Blue Mud Bay), the Maidjunga Member is absent (by erosion) and the Ritarango Formation is disconformably overlain by the Sheridan Member of the Fagan Volcanics.|
29328|Ritarango Formation|Age reasons|Palaeoproterozoic (Statherian). The maximum age is poorly constrained by an inferred age of ~1870 Ma for the underlying Mirarrmina Complex (based on correlation with Bradshaw Complex in eastern Arnhem Bay/western Gove mapsheet areas; Plumb and Roberts, 1992). Its minimum age is constrained by 1710 Ma age determinations for concordant igneous units at the top of the Donydji Group (Rawlings and othes, in prep.). A close temporal relationship with the overlying Fagan Volcanics is favoured, suggesting it is closer in age to 1710 Ma.|
29328|Ritarango Formation|Correlations|Rawlings and others (in prep.) and Rawlings (1994) suggest correlation with the upper parts of the Tawallah and Katherine River Groups in the southern and western McArthur Basin respectively. This correlation is based on geochemical, petrological, lithostratigraphic and geochronological constraints, and the physical form of igneous units.|

29328|Ritarango Formation|Comments|The "Ritarango beds" of Dunnet (1965) and Plumb and Roberts (1965, 1992) were inadequately defined with no type section. The reference locality nominated was too broad to be useful. The need to subdivide them was brought about by the identification of significant mid-sequence changes in rock-type and structural characteristics, thought to be related to a significant sedimentological break and period of tectonism (unconformity). Most of the areas previously mapped as Ritarango beds are now mapped as Ritarango Formation, and a small mappable area of distinctly different (older) outcrop has been extracted and mapped as Dhunganda Formation.|

24476|Rooneys Formation|Type section locality|In vicinity of Kurinelli outstation (latitude 20o37'00"S, longitude 135o02'15"E), from GR 068 180 (base, contact with intrusive gabbro) northeast to GR 030206 (top, conformable contact with overlying Kurinelli Sandstone, 1 km west of the outstation). The typical rock types of the formation are well exposed here, together with dolerite/gabbro sills (a typical association), dipping 20-35oNE.|
24476|Rooneys Formation|Extent|One outcrop area in the northeast of the Davenport Province - in the northern part of Hatches and northwestern part of Hanlon 1:100 000 Sheet areas, Frew River 1:250 000 Sheet area - and one outcrop area in the southwest - in the southeastern part of Elkedra and southwestern part of George Creek 1:100 000 Sheet areas, Elkedra 1:250 000 Sheet area.|
24476|Rooneys Formation|Thickness range|Uncertain because of lack of continuity of outcrop and variable dips. About 1200 m exposed in the type section.|
24476|Rooneys Formation|Lithology|Recessive thin-bedded to laminated, grey or greenish grey, variably micaceous siltstone and fine-grained commonly quartz-poor arenite and greywacke. Rocks are locally cleaved, especially in the east.|
24476|Rooneys Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Conformable on and locally interfingers with Epenarra Volcanics; overlain conformably by thicker bedded and more quartz-rich arenite of Kurinelli Sandstone - contact generally gradational over thickness of several metres; intruded by dolerite/gabbro sills and also by Elkedra Granite (in southeast), granophyre and unnamed granite.|
24476|Rooneys Formation|Age reasons|Younger than 1870 m.y. - U-Pb zircon age of volcanics in Warramunga Group overlain unconformably by Hatches Creek Group. Older than 1640 m.y. - Rb-Sr whole-rock approximate age for Elkedra Granite intruding Rooneys Formation.|

22777|Rorruwuy Sandstone|Name source|Rorruwuy outstation, on the northeastern coast of Arnhem Bay. (AMG PG400520, Arnhem Bay 1:250 000 scale mapsheet area).|
22777|Rorruwuy Sandstone|Unit history|Previously incorrectly mapped as Mount Bonner Sandstone by Dunnet (1965).|
22777|Rorruwuy Sandstone|Geomorphic expression|Northeast-striking ridge of very resistant blocky to bouldery pseudokarstic-weathered sandstone.|
22777|Rorruwuy Sandstone|Type section locality|Latitude 12o11'S, longitude 136o29'15"E. Base of section is at AMG PG618528 and top is at PG615529 (Arnhem Bay mapsheet area). However, as actual contacts are not exposed, no boundary stratotypes were defined.|
22777|Rorruwuy Sandstone|Extent|Outcrop is confined to a very small area 22 km northwest of Yanungbi outstation, adjacent to the Peter John River floodplain, in northeastern Arnhem Bay and northwestern Gove 1:250 000 scale mapsheet areas.|
22777|Rorruwuy Sandstone|Thickness range|90 m at type section. Top and base not exposed and may be faulted. To the north and south of the type section, it appears to have been removed by the unconformity at the base of the overlying Mount Bonner Sandstone.|
22777|Rorruwuy Sandstone|Lithology|White to pink, mature, silicified, fine- to medium-grained, quartzose sandstone. It is thin- to thick-bedded (mostly medium), low-angle trough cross-bedded to flat-bedded and commonly ripple marked. Mudclasts and mudclast impressions are particularly common. Some levels are pervasively pitted with iron oxides, perhaps after pyrite and/or evaporites. Pink coloured sandstone is more common in the basal part of the section, whilst white sandstone is more common in the upper part.|
22777|Rorruwuy Sandstone|Depositional environment|Based on lithofacies and comparison with similar units elsewhere in the McArthur Basin, the environment of deposition is envisaged to have been shallow water, possibly represented by a fan-delta.|
22777|Rorruwuy Sandstone|Relationships and boundaries|Upper sandstone formation of the Spencer Creek Group. Lies with probable disconformity on the Cato Volcanics and is probably unconformably overlain by the Mount Bonner Sandstone. The lower and upper contacts are not exposed, so these relationships are inferred. A disconformable boundary appears most likely between the Rorruwuy Sandstone and the underlying Cato Volcanics, as the sandstone is mature and basal conglomerate appears to be absent. The basal beds are also locally overturned, suggesting the contact is at least partly faulted. The overlying Mount Bonner Sandstone is inferred to be unconformable, as it exhibits a marked angular discordance with other units of the Spencer Creek Group.|
22777|Rorruwuy Sandstone|Age reasons|Palaeoproterozoic (Statherian). Maximum age constrained by the underlying Cato Volcanics (~1710 Ma; Rawlings and others, in prep.). Minimum age constrained by the inferred relationship with the overlying Statherian to Calymmian Mount Bonner Sandstone. A Statherian age is favoured based on concordant relationship with rest of group and probable correlation with the Parsons Range Group, or more specifically the Fleming Sandstone?|
22777|Rorruwuy Sandstone|Correlations|Probably correlates with the Parsons Range Group, but more specifically (and tentatively) the Fleming Sandstone (Blue Mud Bay and Arnhem Bay) and Kurala Sandstone (Arnhem Bay). Correlation is based on the resemblance of exposed rock-types and lithofacies.|
22777|Rorruwuy Sandstone|Comments|The tentative correlations above suggest the Rorruwuy Sandstone is potentially significantly younger than the rest of the Spencer Creek Group, but is essentially concordant with the underlying stratigraphy. However, this is purely speculative and, without any conclusive evidence of a time break, there is no reason to exclude it from the group.|

16675|Scinto Breccia|Identifying features|Definition: The definition is unchanged from that of Walpole & others (1968), who described the unit as the Scinto Breccia Member of the Edith River Volcanics; but rocks of this formation have been reordered into the Edith River Group or El Sherana Group owing to the recognition of an unconformity within them (Needham & Stuart-Smith, in press). The Scinto Breccia Member has been placed in the El Sherana Group. Owing to its distinct lithology (hematitic siliceous breccia) which does not occur in any of the other units of the group, it is proposed to elevate its status to that of formation. The Scinto Breccia is developed at the base of the El Sherana Group generally adjacent to and/or above carbonate rocks in the older sequence (generally South Alligator Group). Where the Scinto Breccia is absent the base of the El Sherana Group is mostly, but not always, represented by the Coronation Sandstone and, as reported by Walpole & others, the Coronation Sandstone and Scinto Breccia can be seen to interfinger in places. The name is derived from the Scinto group of uranium projects near El Sherana. The type section is at Cliff Face mine (AMG 355026) latitude 13o32'S, longitude 132o33'E where the Scinto Breccia overlies Koolpin Formation.|12/APR/12

Peters Creek Volcanics were therefore included in Tawallah Group. Recent detailed mapping of type section of Peters Creek Volcanics (Plumb & Sweet, in press), however, has shown that type Peters Creek Volcanics are probably equivalent to most of Tawallah Group north of Murphy Tectonic Ridge; Seigal Volcanics correlate with only the lowest of seven informal subdivisions of Peters Creek Volcanics. Peters Creek Volcanics are now confined to area south of Murphy Tectonic Ridge and are tentatively removed from Tawallah Group, pending later review of stratigraphic nomenclature of northwest Queensland when 1:100 000 mapping has progressed further.|12/APR/12

38902|Settlement Creek Dolerite|Type section locality|Jackson et al (1987) nominated Mallapunyah Dome as the type area. This fault bounded inlier of Tawallah Group, immediately north of Mallapunyah homestead around latitude 17o05'S longitude 135o50'E (590000E 8110000N) in north-central Wallhallow mapsheet, is reasonably accessible by 4WD vehicle, but contains some local structural complexity.

Drill core is stored in the NTGS Core Library, Darwin, for viewing.

38902|Settlement Creek Dolerite|Thickness range|20-200 m (Ahmad and Wygralak 1989, Rawlings 2002).|
38902|Settlement Creek Dolerite|Lithology|The cores of most sheets are medium- to coarse-grained, aphyric or locally porphyritic dolerite, with ophitic and subophitic textures, comprising plagioclase, pyroxene and opaque oxides. Dolerite is incipiently altered in most areas and assumes a grey/green or pink/brown colour.  Irregular or polygonal jointing is common. The upper 1-5 m of individual sheets is generally finer-grained basalt that is weakly to moderately vesicular or vuggy. Unusual and diagnostic wrinkles and bulbous lobes (`ropy' texture) are locally recognised on the planar upper surface of the Settlement Creek Dolerite or, less commonly, as successive horizons in the upper 1 m of the dolerite sheet (Rawlings 2002). The marginal dolerite of some sheets is also strongly brecciated, with textures ranging from in situ jigsaw-fit to autoclastic and autorotated. Autorotated breccia is monomict to polymict, with angular to subrounded, vesicular and/or massive dolerite clasts.  Finely-laminated green, red/brown, yellow and purple mudstone hornfels and hornfels breccia are developed at the lower and upper contacts of the Settlement Creek Dolerite and locally as large concordant and discordant rafts within the dolerite sheets. The thickness and degree of complication of the hornfels vary according to the type of contact with the adjacent formation (ie smooth, brecciated, complex, irregular or peperitic). In some cases, hornfels is associated with polymictic (dolerite-dolostone-mudstone hornfels) autorotated breccia.|
38902|Settlement Creek Dolerite|Relationships and boundaries|Lies non-conformably between hornfelsed halite-bearing mudstones of the Aquarium Formation below and Wollogorang Formation above, at essentially the same stratigraphic level of the upper Tawallah Group regionally. The upper and lower surfaces are typically smooth, planar or mildly sinuous on a 10 m scale and are generally concordant with the enclosing formations on a kilometre scale (ie sill geometry). Grossly irregular discordant contacts are recognised at several localities, and in some cases, dolerite protrusions are contiguous up into the upper Wollogorang Formation. Examples include parts of the Mallapunyah Dome, Eagle Hawk Neck and the 90 m thick dolerite intersection in DD91CCK1 at Camel Creek (805300E 8136300N, Robinson River mapsheet). The lower boundary of the Settlement Creek Dolerite is also generally planar and concordant, but in some areas (eg Mallapunyah Dome), it is a complicated amalgamation of breccias and coalescing concordant and discordant dolerite bodies. A broad laccolith geometry is interpreted for the Robinson and Mallapunyah Domes.|
38902|Settlement Creek Dolerite|Age reasons|1725-1730 Ma, as constrained by the enclosing Wollogorang Formation (~1730 Ma, Jackson et al 1997) and overlying Hobblechain Rhyolite (~1725 Ma, Page and Sweet 1998).|
38902|Settlement Creek Dolerite|Correlations|Intrusive correlatives include parts of the Peters Creek Volcanics (Ptp1e and Ptp6) in the Murphy Inlier (Calvert Hills and Westmoreland 1:250 000 mapsheets, Jackson et al 2000) and McCaw Formation on the western Arnhem Shelf (Mount Marumba 1:250 000 mapsheet, Sweet et al 1999). Interpreted deeper-level feeders lower in the stratigraphy include the Oenpelli Dolerite on the northern Arnhem Shelf (Millingimbi 1:250 000 mapsheet; Carson et al 1999; Kurt Kyser, Queens University, unpubl data) and altered microdolerite dykes that crosscut the Seigal Volcanics adjacent to the Murphy Inlier (Calvert Hills mapsheet, Sweet et al 1981, Rawlings 2002). Interpreted extrusive correlatives of the Settlement Creek Dolerite include the upper `flow' unit of the Gold Creek Volcanics (`Basalt 4') on the Wearyan Shelf (Calvert Hills and Robinson River mapsheets, Rawlings 2002).|
38902|Settlement Creek Dolerite|Comments|This formation was originally defined as the Settlement Creek Volcanics by Jackson et al (1987), having been interpreted as a mainly extrusive volcanic formation (Yates 1963, Roberts et al 1963, Ahmad and Wygralak 1989, Jackson et al 1987, Pietsch et al 1991, Haines et al 1993). The main evidence cited was the `ropy' upper surface, marginal volcanic breccia (`agglomerate' or autobreccia) and locally intermingled muddy and `tuffaceous' sedimentary rocks.  However, detailed studies by Bull (1993), Rogers (1996) and Rawlings (2002) have observed that it typically has a coarse-grained doleritic texture and intrusive relationship with enclosing hornfelsed sedimentary rocks, indicating that it is a regional-scale composite set of dolerite sills. Consequently, it is renamed here the Settlement Creek Dolerite to reflect the coarser grainsize, and redefined in terms of its boundary relationships and mode of emplacement.  The distribution of the Settlement Creek Dolerite in Bauhinia Downs and Mount Young mapsheets has been corrected since the erroneous definition of Jackson et al (1987). Most sedimentary intervals that were assigned to this formation have now been remapped as McDermott Formation (Pietsch et al 1991, Haines et al 1993).|
37961|Shadow Group|Name source|From Shadow Bluff, in Grant Bluff Formation in the western Elua Range, central HUCKITTA.|
37961|Shadow Group|Unit history|Former component of Mopunga Group sensu Smith (1964) in part; Central Mount Stuart beds of Smith and Milligan (1964) in part; and mapped as PL u?s3 of that unit by Shaw and Warren (1975) in part; Donkey Creek beds of Walter (1980) in part; Arthur Creek beds (Smith 1964) in part; Errarra Formation of Freeman (1986) in part (Ambrose et al 2001).|
37961|Shadow Group|Constituents|Octy Formation, Neutral Junction Formation, Mount Baldwin Formation, Adam Shale, Mount Birnie beds, Red Heart Dolostone; provisionally Sylvester Sandstone and Riversdale Formation.|
37961|Shadow Group|Extent|BARROW CREEK, ALCOOTA, ELKEDRA, HUCKITTA, TOBERMORY, HAY RIVER, MOUNT WHELAN, GLENORMISTON, URANDANGI, DUCHESS.|
37961|Shadow Group|Relationships and boundaries|Overlies Elkera Formation of Mopunga Group with angular unconformity, presumed to unconformably overlie Sun Hill Arkose of Keepera Group, and disconformably overlies Proterozoic rocks including Central Mount Stuart Formation of Mopunga Group and Little Burke Tillite of Keepera Group (Shergold 1985:7, Haines et al 1991). Unconformably (Shergold and Druce 1980) to conformably and gradationally (Shergold et al 1985) overlain by Thorntonia Limestone or where this is absent, unconformably overlain by Beetle Creek Formation, Chabalowe Formation (all Narpa Group) or Mesozoic sedimentary rocks.|
37961|Shadow Group|Age reasons| Ichnofossils of Cambrian aspect in Mount Baldwin Formation, Octy Formation, Neutral Junction Formation and Mount Birnie beds, acritarchs and bioturbated beds in Adam Shale, and archaeocyaths and small skeletal fossils in Red Heart Dolostone confirm an Early Cambrian age (Nemakit-Daldynian or Tommotian to late Atdabanian in Siberian terms; Laurie and Shergold 1985, Walter et al 1989, Debrenne and Zhuravlev 1992). Sylvester Sandstone presumed by Shergold (1985:7) to be Early Cambrian by lithological correlation with Mount Baldwin Formation, but may be Neoproterozoic (Pritchard in Shergold and Druce 1980:155). Riversdale Formation is directly overlain by Thorntonia Limestone, either conformably (Shergold et al 1985) or unconformably (Shergold and Druce 1980), and is thus in the age range of late Early to early Middle Cambrian.|
37961|Shadow Group|Correlations|Arumbera Sandstone III and IV, Quandong Conglomerate, Eninta Sandstone, Mount Currie Conglomerate, Mutitjulu Arkose and Todd River Dolostone of Amadeus Basin, Yuendumu Sandstone II and Walbiri Dolostone of Ngalia Basin (Shergold et al 1985, Young et al 2002).|
37961|Shadow Group|Comments|The Shadow Group embraces all Lower Cambrian rocks in the southern Georgina Basin, although these do not span the entire epoch. The Sylvester Sandstone and Riversdale Formation are only provisionally included in the group due to uncertainty as to their age: the former may be older (Mopunga or even Keepera Group), the latter younger (Narpa Group). Regardless, the Shadow Group includes an unconformity between Mount Baldwin Formation-Adam Shale and Red Heart Dolostone (Shergold 1985), and possibly between Octy Formation and Neutral Junction Formation (Haines et al 1991).|

24495|Simpsons Gap Metasediments|Type section locality|Along Jay Creek in Alice Springs 1:100 0000 Sheet area between GR 5650-506767 to 513779. Basal conglomerate does not crop out at type locality but a good exposure can be seen at GR 5650-765782 in Alice Springs 1:100 000 Sheet area.|

17111|South Alligator Group|General description|Definition: Needham and others (1980) extensively redefined the group relative to the description given by earlier workers who first introduced the term (Walpole & others 1968), and included in it the Koolpin Formation, Shovel Billabong Andesite, Gerowie Tuff and Kapalga Formation. Later work (Stuart-Smith & others, 1984a and b) determined fundamental lithological differences in the group east and west of the Waterfall Creek Fault, where to the west the normal sequence exists but to the east volcanic components are absent and no stratigraphic subdivision is possible (Needham & Stuart-Smith, 1984). The name Kapalga Formation is restricted to areas east of the fault. Rocks previously referred to west of the fault as Kapalga Formation (i.e. stratigraphically above the Gerowie Tuff) are renamed Mount Bonnie Formation. Thus the South Alligator Group as redefined contains five formations: Koolpin Formation, Shovel Billabong Andesite, Gerowie Tuff, Mount Bonnie Formation, Kapalga Formation.|

29406|Spencer Creek Group|Name source|Spencer Creek (lat. 12o20'S, long. 136o25'30"E), which flows into the eastern side of Arnhem Bay. Arnhem Bay 1:250 000 scale mapsheet area.|
29406|Spencer Creek Group|Unit history|The formations which now collectively make up the Spencer Creek Group were originally mapped as "Spencer Creek Volcanics" by Dunnet (1965), which was subsequently formalised by Plumb and Roberts (1992). This also included some small outcrops now recognised as belonging to the Dhalinybuy Granite and Balbirini Dolomite (Nathan Group) which were not previously mapped in this area.|
29406|Spencer Creek Group|Constituents|In ascending order; Yanungbi Volcanics, Gove Sandstone, Yuduyudu  Formation, Cato Volcanics and Rorruwuy Sandstone.|
29406|Spencer Creek Group|Geomorphic expression|Sandstone-dominated formations form resistant and upstanding strike ridges, while the igneous-mudstone units are typically recessive.|
29406|Spencer Creek Group|Type section locality|Type localities and reference areas as defined for each constituent formation. Plumb and Roberts (1992) did not assign a specific type section, only a loose reference area to the "Spencer Creek Volcanics".|
29406|Spencer Creek Group|Extent|Restricted to a series of small northeast-striking disconnected ridges stretching between Spencer Creek and Mount Bonner, northeastern Arnhem Bay and northwestern Gove 1:250 000 scale mapsheet areas.|
29406|Spencer Creek Group|Thickness range|1500 m. Unconformity at the base of overlying units (Mount Bonner Sandstone and Balbirini Dolomite) has reduced the thickness to 200 m locally.|
29406|Spencer Creek Group|Lithology|Undeformed lithic to quartzose sandstone and conglomeratic sandstone, felsic and mafic igneous rocks, and mudstone.|
29406|Spencer Creek Group|Depositional environment|Ranges from fluviatile to shallow-water delta-fan for the sedimentary facies; igneous rocks are interpreted as mainly volcanic.|
29406|Spencer Creek Group|Relationships and boundaries|Unconformably overlies the metamorphic and granitic rocks of the Bradshaw Complex and the Orosirian Dhalinybuy Granite, and is unconformably overlain by coarse-grained siliciclastic rocks of the Mount Bonner Sandstone.|
29406|Spencer Creek Group|Age reasons|Palaeoproterozoic (Statherian). The maximum age is constrained by the underlying ~1870 Ma Bradshaw Complex. However, a likely comagmatic relationship between the lower-most unit of the group (Yanungbi Volcanics) and the nearby Latram Granite, indicates a maximum age of ~1710 Ma. An indistinguishable age for the Cato Volcanics near the top of the group tightly constrains the majority of the sequence, however, there is no minimum constraining age for the upper-most unit of the group (Rorruwuy Sandstone).|
29406|Spencer Creek Group|Correlations|The bulk of the group correlates with the Fagan phase within the regional framework of Rawlings (1994), based on geochemical, petrological, lithostratigraphic and geochronological constraints, and the physical form of igneous units. This infers correlation with the upper units of the Tawallah and Katherine River Groups in the southern and western portions of the McArthur Basin respectively. It also includes the upper part of the Donydji Group (Fagan Volcanics) in southern Arnhem Bay/northern Blue Mud Bay 1:250 000 scale mapsheet areas, and possibly the Gadabara Volcanics in eastern Blue Mud Bay. A probable disconformable relationship exists between the Cato Volcanics and overlying Rorruwuy Sandstone, thus not providing a constraint on the minimum age of the group. This allows for possible correlation of this upper-most sandstone unit with the Fleming Sandstone in upper part of the Parsons Range Group.|

29406|Spencer Creek Group|Comments|The existing definition of the "Spencer Creek Volcanics" does not take into consideration the presence of a mappable internal stratigraphy of both sedimentary and igneous units. For this reason, the succession is renamed as the Spencer Creek Group and is subdivided into five formations.|

17395|Strangways Metamorphic Complex|Name source|The Complex is named after Strangways Range which spans central and northwestern Alice Springs 1:250 000 Sheet area. (This is an extended usage approved by the NT Lands Branch and National Mapping and shown on latest 1:250 000 topographic map).|
17395|Strangways Metamorphic Complex|Unit history|Previously published as Strangways Range Metamorphic Complex by Shaw & Warren (1975). The name is now changed to Strangways Metamorphic Complex for brevity.|
17395|Strangways Metamorphic Complex|Constituents|The Complex includes the Utnalanama Granulite, Harry Anorthositic Gabbro, the Erontonga metamorphics, the Cadney metamorphics, the Yambah granulite, the Ongeva granulite, and the Bungitina metamorphics in the Alice Springs 1:250 000 Sheet area. The Complex also includes the Mount Bleechmore Granulite and the Kanandra Granulite in the Alcoota 1:250 000 Sheet area (Shaw & Warren, 1975). The Ingula Migmatite Suite and the Wuluma Granite are considered to have   formed during the ultrametamorphism which has affected the entire complex and are also 
included in it.|21/MAR/11
17395|Strangways Metamorphic Complex|Type section locality|Strangways Range is the type area. A reference section between GR 5751-042263 and Southern Cross Bore (GR 5751-191395) is representataive of the lower part of the Complex. jA reference section between the White Lady Mica Mine and White Hill Dam in northeastern Alice Springs 1:250 000 Sheet area is a representative section of the upper part of the Complex because its boundary with the overlying Harts Range Group is clearly displayed.|
17395|Strangways Metamorphic Complex|Extent|Northwestern and northern central Alice Springs 1:250 0000 Sheet area, and southern central and central-eastern Alcoota 1:250 000 Sheet area.|
17395|Strangways Metamorphic Complex|Lithology|Mainly mafic and felsic granulites and lesser amounts of cordierite and sillimanite-bearing gneisses. The upper part of the Complex also contains calc-silicate rock, marble, sillimanite gneiss, schistose biaotite gneiss, and layered amphibolite.|
17395|Strangways Metamorphic Complex|Relationships and boundaries|The unit is overlain by the Irindina Gneiss (Joklik, 1955) of the Harts Range Group between Old (Schaber) Station Well and White Hill Dam. The contact is slightly discordant in that there is a distinct change in rock type, an abarupt increase in the continuity of compositional layering, and in a sharp decrease in the amount of minor folding. Farther west (north of the Oonagalabi Prospect) the contact becomes clear angular discordance, but the presence of a deformed zone containing numerous intrafolial folds and small thrust faults makes the nature of the contact difficult to assess. The Strangways Metamorphic Complex contains much less garnet in its biotite gneiss, and includes abundant quartzofeldspathic gneiss not apparent in the Irindina Gneiss. Cross-cutting mafic granulite and amphibolite bodies (meta-gabbros) are common in the Strangways Metamorphic Complex, but very rare and generally absent from the Harts Range Group. Compositional units tend to be much more continuous in the Harts Range Group. The Complex is thought to be an older basement (Division 1) below the other rocks (Divisions 2 and 3) in the Arunta Block.|
17395|Strangways Metamorphic Complex|Age reasons|A widespread metamorphism which affeacts the entire Complex has been datead by Black (1975) at about 1800 m.y. and at 1860 +/- 70 m.y. by Iyer, Woodford & Wilson (1976).|

In type section, shallow-water sandstone facies comprises interbedded: (i) medium- to very thickly bedded, diffusely bedded, quartzose to lithic, locally ferruginous and micaceous ( glauconitic) fine  medium-grained sandstone with amalgamated low-angle trough and hummocky crossstratification; (ii) medium- to coarse-grained glauconitic sandstone, containing small red-brown mudstone flakes, pits after evaporites and trough cross-beds and; (iii) minor decimetre-scale beds of very coarse to granular, pebbly lithic sandstone with parallel lamination. Storm-shelf facies composed of flaggy white, fawn, red-brown or purple, micaceous siltstone and fine- to medium-grained quartzose to sublithic ( micaceous) sandstone.

Lies conformably on lower Crow Formation and is, in turn, conformably overlain by Mittiebah Sandstone. Member not differentiated in areas where Crow Formation is overlain by Constance Sandstone.|
37740|Tobacco Member|Age reasons|Maximum age of 1591+/- 10 Ma, based on reworked tuffaceous material from underlying Lawn Hill Formation (Page et al 2000) in LAWN HILL, or 1595 +/- 6 Ma based on tuffs in Lawn Hill Formation in same area (Page and Sweet 1998). Interpreted age range of 1500-1400 Ma for South Nicholson Group based on correlation with Roper Group of southern McArthur Basin (Dunn et al 1966; Plumb and Derrick 1975). Ages of 1492 +/- 4 Ma and 1493 +/- 4 Ma for tuffaceous material from Mainoru Formation in lower Roper Group (Jackson et al 1999) provide the most reliable estimate for age of that group, and hence, for Crow Formation, including Tobacco Member.|

27070|Tollis Formation|Type section locality|Between the ruins of the Mount Todd Battery (Katherine GR 875318) and a point 4 km to the southeast. A conformable, steeply dipping folded sequence comprising of three subunits the lower about 740 m interbedded greywacke, pink tuffaceous greywacke, siltstone, pale green argillite, cherty tuff, overlain by about 590 to 900 m of interbedded pale green argillite, spotted crystal tuff, greywacke, tuffaceous greywacke and siltstone overlain by about 850 m of interbedded phyllite, argillite, greywacke and crystal tuff. Base is taken as lowermost volcanic bed where unconformable contact is obscure. Sequence continues to axis of basinal synform, i.e. top not exposed.  Refrence section: Banks of Phillips Creek between Katherine GRs 924278, 932263. Northwest-dipping 1280 m thick sequence which at 932263 is overlain unconformably by the Phillips Creek Sandstone of the Edith River Group.|

68748|Top Lily Sandstone Member|Geomorphic expression|A series of low ridges and plateaux.|06/FEB/12
68748|Top Lily Sandstone Member|Type section locality|Upper part of the Playford Sandstone type section, 4 km southeast of Mitchiebo Waterhole, in MOUNT DRUMMOND. The section runs from south to north: base is at latitude 18o39'39"S longitude 137o7'29"E (724130E 7935360N), the top about 500 m to the north, at latitude 18o39'25"S longitude 137o7'33"E (724230E 7935810N). The locality is easily accessed from the Mittiebah homestead-Wangalinji track.|06/FEB/12
68748|Top Lily Sandstone Member|Extent|Forms a west to west-southwest-trending outcrop belt in central to southwestern MOUNT DRUMMOND, from the headwaters of Maloney Creek in the east, to Waterfall Creek in the southwest. Outcrops most extensively in ranges forming the watershed of Eight Mile, Ten Mile, and Waterfall Creeks. An isolated outcrop occurs in the northwest, east of the headwaters of Benmara Creek.|06/FEB/12
68748|Top Lily Sandstone Member|Thickness range|143 m thick in the type section, 750 m 17 km to the west-northwest, in the Playford Anticline, and 1100 m 40 km away in the westernmost outcrops of the Ten Mile Anticline.|06/FEB/12
68748|Top Lily Sandstone Member|Lithology|White to pink or darker pink-red, thick to very thick bedded, very fine- to fine-grained, well-sorted lithic sandstone; scattered granule and pebbles; trough cross-bedded on a large to giant scale, current ripples and primary current lineation common.|06/FEB/12
68748|Top Lily Sandstone Member|Relationships and boundaries|Lower contact is conformable and gradational with the Wangalinji Member. The contact is placed where shale and siltstone give way to pink, fine-grained lithic sandstone over 10-15 m. The upper contact, with the No Mans Sandstone Member in the type section, is sharp and locally erosive, but essentially conformable. In outcrops other than the type section and environs, the No Mans Sandstone Member is absent, and the Top Lily Sandstone Member is overlain, apparently conformably, by the Crow Formation. The boundary is placed at the abrupt transition from fine-grained lithic and quartz sandstone into shale. Parent unit: Playford Sandstone.|06/FEB/12
68748|Top Lily Sandstone Member|Age reasons|A maximum age of 1591+/-10 Ma, based on reworked tuffaceous material from the underlying Lawn Hill Formation (Page et al 2000) in LAWN HILL, or 1595+/-6 Ma based on tuffs in the Lawn Hill Formation in the same area (Page and Sweet 1998). The interpreted age range of 1500-1400 Ma for the South Nicholson Group is based on its correlation with the Roper Group of the southern McArthur Basin (Dunn et al 1966; Plumb & Derrick 1975). Ages of 1492+/-4 and 1493+/-4 Ma for tuffaceous material from the Mainoru Formation in the Roper Group (Jackson et al 1999) provides the most reliable estimate for the age of the lower part of that Group, and hence for the Playford Sandstone and its members.|06/FEB/12
68748|Top Lily Sandstone Member|Correlations|None known, but it is likely that sandstones low in the Renner Group (Hussey et al 2001) and the Roper Group (Jackson et al 1999) are in part correlative, given the overall correlation between these groups.|06/FEB/12

37622|Ulta Limestone|Geomorphic expression|Low mesas with local relief of up to 30m, but more typically 10-20m, or rubbly outcrops in cores of aeolian dunes (i.e. where unit has been exposed by deflation of red Quaternary sand).|
37622|Ulta Limestone|Type section locality|Measured section at 24o 13' 13''S, 134o 13' 32''E, which is also type locality of Kangaroo Well Local Fauna. Depositional attributes at type section comparatively well preserved.|
37622|Ulta Limestone|Extent|Sinuous line of discontinuous outcrop extending about 50km across western exposure of Ooraminna Anticline and eastern exposure of Orange Creek Syncline, following structure in Amadeus Basin. Mapped on current (First Edition) 1:250,000 Rodinga Geological Sheet SG/53-02 as "Tb, silicrete (grey billy)" and "Tl, chalcedonic limestone, siltstone and calcareous sandstone containing freshwater gastropods" (Ranford et al. 1968, Cook 1969).  These generic map units are widespread across Rodinga and adjacent first addition map sheets (eg, Henbury SG/53-01, Hale River SG/53-03, Kulgera SG/53-05, Finke SG/53-06), encompassing strata deposited in a variety of structural settings and of possibly varying age.  Concept of Ulta Limestone expressly limited as defined herein.|
37622|Ulta Limestone|Thickness range|Up to an estimated 40m.|
37622|Ulta Limestone|Lithology|White to dark yellowish-orange limestone, predominantly calcimudstone containing terrestrial and freshwater gastropods, with minor calcarenite and conglomeratic limestone, some of which contain vertebrate fossils, plus diagenetic end-members including varieties of caliche, chalcedonic limestone and chalcedony (grey billy). Plane to lenticular bedforms, with scour and fill structures.|
37622|Ulta Limestone|Depositional environment|Freshwater palaeochannel.|
37622|Ulta Limestone|Fossils|Unit is type formation of  of gastropods Physastra rodingae McMichael, 1968, Meracomelon lloydi McMicheal, 1968 and Bothriembyron praecursor McMichael, 1968. Flannery et al. (1982) described a marsupial Balbaroo sp. from unit.  Ostracoda, Gastropoda, Osteichthys, Amphibia, Reptilia, Aves and Marsupialia listed in, for example, Lloyd (1968), Stirton et al. (1968) and Rich (1991).|
37622|Ulta Limestone|Relationships and boundaries|Colluvium, alluvium and red aeolian sand generally mask base of unit. At 24degrees 14' S, 134degrees 14' E (2.14 km at 197degrees from type locality) and at 24degrees 16' 42'' S, 134degrees 10' 35'' E (8.13 km at 212degrees from type locality), unit rests with angular unconformity on Mereenie  Sandstone of Amadeus Basin. No superposed strata other than Quaternary aeolian sand locally draping unit.|
37622|Ulta Limestone|Structure and Metamorphism|Essentially flat-lying. Very low-angle bedding might either reflect primary depositional attitudes, or could be evidence of very mild tilting.|
37622|Ulta Limestone|Age reasons|Vertebrate fauna (Kangaroo Well Local Fauna of Stirton et al. (1968)) includes marsupial taxa with biogeochronological utility, notably Balbaroo sp. Flannery, Archer and Plane, 1982, to which the following, but as yet unpublished discoveries may be added: cf. Neohelos tirarensis Stirton, cf. Pildra magnus Pledge, cf. Marlu kutjamarpensis Woodburne, Tedford and Archer and cf. Ektopodon stirtoni Pledge. In accordance with most recent calibrations of the continental land mammal biochronological scheme, unit is interpreted to be of Late Oligocene or Early Miocene age (see e.g. Stirton et al. (1968); Flannery et al. (1982); Woodburne et al. (1985, 1993); Rich (1991); Murray et al. (2000)).|
37622|Ulta Limestone|Correlations|Marsupial biocorrelation and stage-of-evolution comparisons correlate unit with Etadunna Formation (Lake Eyre Basin); Namba Formation (Callabonna Basin) and older strata of Carl Creek Limestone (Karumba Basin) (e.g. Woodburne et al. 1985, Megirian 1992).|

In the Lily Creek area the relationship between Lilly Creek Member and Unbunmroo Member is probably unconformable. At Black Mountain the base is recognised by the presence of a thick cross-stratified peloid and ooid grainstone which locally encloses or surrounds biohermal mounds of stromatolitic boundstone (Dunham, 1962). This basal unit is commonly dolomitised and is sandy in places. The upper boundary is marked by the increased occurrence of colour mottled (two-tone) limestones.|

Formerly assigned to Jarong Conglomerate in Wingate Mountains 1:100 000 (Pontifex and Mendum, 1972).|
26967|Uniya Formation|Type section locality|The holostratotype is in the headwaters of Hayward Creek and lies along a line between AMG 968960 (latitude 13o35'46", longitude 130o49'24") and AMG 985950 (latitude 13o36'20", longitude 130o50'2"), Daly River 1:100 000. The parastratotype is at a hill 3 km SE of Collah Waterhole, AMG 084079 (latitude 14o23', longitude 130o56'34") Wingate Mountains 1:100 000. An area has to be given for the holostratotype because no vertical sections showing the full range of lithologies in the Formation are exposed.|
26967|Uniya Formation|Extent|Crops out intermittently across an area of about 25 sq km in the headwaters of Hayward Creek, and at a small exposure in the southeast corner of the Daly River 1:100 000. Poorly exposed in mesas in Jarong Springs - Collah Waterhole area, and well exposed south of Collah Waterhole near AMG 084079 (Wingate Mountains 1:100 000).|
26967|Uniya Formation|Thickness range|Varies greatly. Ranges 0-30 m in holostratotype. Ranges 0-60 in parastratotype. 137 m of tillite encountered in a diamond drillhole at AMG 059082 (latitude 14o23'20", longitude 130o54'34").|
26967|Uniya Formation|Lithology|Holostratotype: The tillite includes massive unsorted tillite, glaciofluvial sandstones and minor conglomerate, varved lake deposits with dropstones, poorly bedded mudstones/fine sandstones with massive slumping and soft sediment deformation. Erratics are composed of Early Proterozoic metasediments, Early Proterozoic granites and gneisses, Late Proterozoic quartzites and carbonates. Proportions of lithologies cannot be estimated because of lateral facies changes and inadequate exposure. Parastratotype: Tillite, glaciolacustrine arenites and mudstones, glaciofluvial arenites, tillite and boulder conglomerate approximately 70%, glaciolacustrine and glaciofluvial sediments approximately 30%.|
26967|Uniya Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Overlies Stray Creek Member of Buldiva Sandstone and Hinde Dolomite (Tolmer Group) on Daly River 1:100 000, and Saddle Creek Formation and Angalarri Siltstone (Auvergne Group) on Wingate Mountains 1:100 000, with a small angular unconformity. Overlain by Antrim Plateau Volcanics - relationship not definite but probably unconformable.|
26967|Uniya Formation|Age reasons|Older than Early Cambrian (Antrim Plateau Volcanics), younger than Middle-Late Proterozoic. Post-dates Giants Reef Fault.

23121|Walker River Formation|Name source|From the Walker River, in the west-central part of the Blue Mud Bay-Port Langdon 1:250 000 Sheet. The headwaters of the river occur at approximately 13o20'S, 135o22'E, and the river enters the Gulf of Carpentaria at 13o35'30"S, 135o50'00"E.|
23121|Walker River Formation|Unit history|This unit occupies a large part of Skwarko's (1966) 'coastal belt', and was previously placed within the Mullaman Beds. Use of the name Mullaman Beds has been discouraged (Hughes, 1978) due to the recognised stratigraphic inadequacy of the term in its original form, where it was used to describe most Mesozoic rocks in the northeastern Northern Territory. In terms of Skwarko's (1966) informal stratigraphic nomenclature, this unit is equivalent in part to Skwarko's 'units 2-7', and possibly also to 'unit B and C' of his 'inland belt'. Skwarko's (1966) informal stratigraphic nomenclature is now superseded, and usage of his informal names ('belts' and 'units') should be discontinued. Further mapping is likely to extend the known westward limit of the Walker River Formation, and an aim of such mapping should be to replace the old terminology (Mullaman Beds, and Skwarko's informal terminology) on the basis of the new stratigraphic definition proposed here.|
23121|Walker River Formation|Type section locality|Reference section: Reference sections exist along the edge of dissected plateaus and large mesas in the areas surrounding the Walker River, within the boundaries of what was a large palaeoembayment in Cretaceous time between latitudes 13o21'S and 13o40'S, and longitudes 135o23'E and 135o31'E. Good reference sections also exist along the entire length of the outcrop belt of this marine shelfal formation, and the lithological character of the unit changes in response to facies changes away from the palaeoshoreline. For completeness, the locations of three reference sections are included here, covering proximal, intermediate and distal palaeogeographical settings of the unit.  In order (proximal to distal) their locations are: 13o25'51"S, 135o26'54"E on the Blue Mud Bay-Port Langdon 1:250 000 Sheet, 15o36'45"S, 135o36'30"E on the Mount Young 1:250 000 Sheet, and 17o14'00"S, 135o38'30"E on the Wallhallow 1:250 000 Sheet.|
23121|Walker River Formation|Description at type locality|Lower boundary stratotype: Base of a 25.5 m interval of flat-lying sandstone, siltstone and subordinate claystone interbedded with intraformational chert granule to pebble conglomerate. This stratotype occurs as a large steep hill exposure at 17o35'30"S, 137o49'00"E on the Calvert Hills 1:250 000 Sheet. The base of the unit is represented by an erosional disconformity which is mantled locally by iron-oxide stained sandstone forming a hardground. Beneath the disconformity at the base of the Walker River Formation lies 12 m of an unnamed fining-upward sandy conglomeratic unit of probable Early Cretaceous to Jurassic age. This older unnamed Mesozoic unit overlies Proterozoic basement with angular unconformity. Upper boundary stratotype: Top of a 7 m interval of weathered, grey to white sandstone, siltstone, and claystone exposed along the banks of Wonga Creek, about 40 km southwest of Nhulunbuy, at 12o29'15"S, 136o34'00"E on the Arnhem Bay-Gove 1:250 000 Sheet. The base is not exposed, but the top is a prominent disconformity with several metres of erosional relief. Immediately overlying the disconformity are orange, large-scale trough cross-bedded sandstones of the Yirrkala Formation.|
23121|Walker River Formation|Extent|The unit is extensively distributed along the western and south-western margins of the Gulf of Carpentaria, mostly within the Northern Territory but also within far northwestern Queensland. The unit is preserved as erosional remnants in the form of mesas, plateaus and low-lying rubbly hills occupying a broad zone up to 150 km inland from the present Gulf coastline. The erosional remnants commonly form outliers resting directly on Proterozoic rocks of the McArthur Basin. The area encompassed by this unit is in the order of 120 000 km2, but the western and southern margins of the outcrop belt are relatively poorly defined, as the unit tends to thin in these directions. The main outcrop belt lies east of about 134o30'E, west of 138o50'E, south of 12o05'S, and north of about 18o55'S. The outcrop belt covers a large part of the eastern Northern Territory along the margin of the Gulf of Carpentaria, and occupies all or part of sixteen 1:250 000 Sheet areas.|23/APR/09
23121|Walker River Formation|Thickness range|Range 2 to 38 m in outcrop. At least 55 m in the subsurface (e.g. Bolton, 1982; Sands, 1979). Construction of composite sections (Krassay, 1994b) indicates that the overall thickness of the unit in outcrop is greater than 70 m.|
23121|Walker River Formation|Lithology|The bulk of unit is weathered sandstone, white to dark orange, moderately to well sorted, well rounded to subangular, coarse/medium- to fine-grained quartz arenite with iron-oxide staining. Interbedded with the sandstone are flaser and lenticular interbeds of white to pale yellow, silica-cemented, finely laminated clayey siltstone. Thin, sharp-based intraformational chert and lithic pebble lags occur parallel or slightly discordant to bedding, and more rarely pebbles are concentrated into metre-wide lenses. In distal palaeogeographical localities the overall amount of sandstone is less, and the bulk of the unit consists of laminated siltstone with sandy interbeds. The unit forms both fining-upward and coarsening-upward grain size cycles, typically 5 to 10 m thick. Sedimentary structures within this heterolithic unit include hummocky cross-stratification, planar cross-bedding (most scales), wave and current ripples, gravelly ripples, ripple-lamination, convolute lamination, slump structures, gutters and gutter casts and other complex erosional scours and tool marks, graded beds, coquinas, and various styles of lamination. The unit contains abundant to rare, moderately to poorly preserved specimens of molluscan macrofossils, mainly bivalves, but also rare ammonites and belemnites. Rare stratigraphic intervals have segmented plant fossils mixed with the molluscan fossils. Marine trace fossils of the Skolithos and Cruziana ichnofacies are common, and are characteristic of the high-energy shallow-marine depositional environment of the unit (Pemberton et al., 1992). Fine-grained outcrops (and drillcore) that are not extensively weathered yield low-diversity microfloras (spores, pollen, dinoflagellates) and marine arenaceous foraminifera of the Ammobaculites Association (Haig, 1979).|
23121|Walker River Formation|Relationships and boundaries|In outcrop and subsurface the unit overlies older Mesozoic units with disconformity, or Palaeoproterozoic sedimentary rocks with angular unconformity. The Walker River Formation is disconformably overlain by the Yirrkala Formation. Palaeoenvironment:  The unit generally represents high-energy deposition in the foreshore to offshore shallow-marine zone. Some interbedded stratigraphic intervals represent distal deltaic to deltaic-marine depositional environments.|
23121|Walker River Formation|Age reasons|Skwarko (1966) collected marine molluscan macrofossils from these rocks and proposed an age range of Neocomian to Aptian, with rare Albian aged rocks. However, these biostratigraphic age determinations have now been refined (Krassay, 1994a, b), and the age of the unit is considered as late Aptian to early Cenomanian. Palynomorphs in the lower part of this unit, in US Steel drillholes near Numbulwar, belong to the Coptospora paradoxa spore-pollen Zone and the Canninginopsis denticulata microplankton Zone and, give an age of middle Albian (Alley, 1991). Correlative outcrops contain arenaceous foraminifera belonging to the Riyadhella crespinae Zone, which give an age range of late early Albian to late Albian for the lower to middle part of the unit (Haig, 1991). Arenaceous foraminifera belonging to the Bigenerina pitmani Zone in rocks from the lowest exposed stratigraphic interval of the unit give an age of late Aptian (Haig, 1991). On the basis of correlation to dated stratigraphic intervals on Groote Eylandt (Krassay, unpublished data), the upper part of this unit is considered to be early Cenomanian in age. The full age range of the unit is likely to be Aptian to Cenomanian.|

Remainder of formation is laminated shale with thin-bedded siltstone and very fine-grained lithic sandstone interbeds, interbedded with medium to thick beds of white cross-bedded, sub-lithic, medium- to coarse-grained sandstone; minor purple-red mudstone with discontinuous disrupted laminae, ubiquitous mudflakes, and desiccation cracks, and rare stromatolitic chert and carbonates.|06/FEB/12
38512|Wangalinji Member|Relationships and boundaries|Overlies Widdallion Sandstone Member of the Lawn Hill Formation disconformably in outcrops between Mitchiebo Waterhole and Western Creek, a distance of about 50 km. Southwest of Mitchiebo Waterhole an angular unconformity exists between the two. The boundary is marked by an abrupt change from purple/brown highly micaceous and lithic sandstones of the Widdallion Sandstone Member, to lighter coloured (white, light brown or pink) more quartz-rich granule to pebbly sandstone of the Wangalinji Member. The upper boundary, with the Top Lily Sandstone Member, is conformable. It is marked by a rapid transition from interbedded siltstone and shale to thick bedded pink to brown, fine-grained lithic sandstone of the Top Lily Sandstone Member. Parent unit: Playford Sandstone.|06/FEB/12
38512|Wangalinji Member|Age reasons|A maximum age of 1591+/-10 Ma, based on reworked tuffaceous material from the underlying Lawn Hill Formation (Page et al 2000) in LAWN HILL, or 1595+/-6 Ma based on tuffs in the Lawn Hill Formation in the same area (Page and Sweet 1998). The interpreted age range of 1500-1400 Ma for the South Nicholson Group is based on its correlation with the Roper Group of the southern McArthur Basin (Dunn et al 1966; Plumb & Derrick 1975). Ages of 1492+/-4 and 1493+/-4 Ma for tuffaceous material from the Mainoru Formation in the Roper Group (Jackson et al 1999) provides the most reliable estimate for the age of the lower part of that Group, and hence for the Playford Sandstone and its members.|06/FEB/12
38512|Wangalinji Member|Correlations|None known, but it is likely that sandstones low in the Renner Group (Hussey et al 2001) and the Roper Group (Jackson et al 1999) are in part correlative, given the overall correlation between these groups.|06/FEB/12

38512|Wangalinji Member|Comments|The concordant nature of the contact led Sweet (1984) to include the member in the underlying Widdallion Sandstone Member in eastern outcrops, adjacent to Western Creek.

24563|Warramana Sandstone|Name source|Warramana Creek, Mount Young 1:250 000 scale map sheet area.|
24563|Warramana Sandstone|Unit history|The Warramana Sandstone was mapped without adequate definition on the first edition Mount Young (Plumb and Paine, 1964) and Bauhinia Downs (Smith, 1964) 1:250 000 geological map and was at that time considered to belong to the McArthur Group. Plumb and Brown (1973) recommended abandonment of the name as they considered it synonymous with the Tatoola Sandstone of the McArthur Group. Muir (1980) reinterpreted many outcrops as the Cambrian Bukalara Sandstone. However, remapping by Haines and others (in press) indicates that most outcrops originally mapped as Warramana Sandstone represent a distinct formation situated stratigraphically near the top of the Tawallah Group. Outcrops of sandstone in the Pellew 1:250 000 sheet area, previously mapped as 'Masterton Formation' by Smith (1963), are now identified as Warramana Sandstone.|
24563|Warramana Sandstone|Geomorphic expression|Outcrops well as low hills or strike ridges, often with a distinctive 'pseudokarstic' weathering pattern.|
24563|Warramana Sandstone|Type section locality|At latitude 15o43.6'S, longitude 135o42.3'E (AMG grid reference NC625060) in southern Scrutton Range in the Bauhinia Downs 1:250 000 map sheet area. This is the only section with conformable lower and upper contacts. This section is presented graphically in Pietsch and others (1991).  Reference sections: Refereance sections are nominatead at NC890640 and the core from diamond drillhole McA14 (PC331570; stored at Department of Mines and Energy Core Library, Darwin; log in Haines and others, in press) on the Mount Young 1:250 000 map sheet area, as the type section does not display the full range of lithologicall units seen throughout the formation's distribution.|
24563|Warramana Sandstone|Extent|Mainly restricted to the eastern half of the Mount Young and southwestern corner of the Pellew 1:250 000 map sheet areas. Localised outcrops have been identified in western Mount Young and northern Bauhinia Downs 1:250 000 map sheet areas.|
24563|Warramana Sandstone|Thickness range|115 m at the type section. The greatest recorded thickness is an incomplete intersection of 255 m in diamond drillhole McA14. Reference locality at NC890640 is estimated to be 240 m thick.|
24563|Warramana Sandstone|Lithology|The formation can be lithologically subdivided into 4 subunits although some are of local extent only. Unit 1 (base) is most widespread in outcrop, while unit 4 (top) is restricted to one outcrop only (NC890640), and here separated from unit 3 by a non-outcropping interval. Unit 1: red-brown to pink, mainly medium-grained thin- to medium-bedded litharenite. Unit 2: thin horizon of ferruginous sandstone and mudstone. Includes an interval of pisolitic ironstone and conglomerate in McA14. Unit 3: pale pink to white, fine- to coarse-grained sublitharenite and quartzarenite, becoming less lithic up-section. Unit 4: similar to unit 1 although with a somewhat greater lithic content. Lithic material is dominated by felsic volcanic fragments throughout the formation. All units are flat-bedded to trough cross-bedded and display wave and current ripples.|
24563|Warramana Sandstone|Depositional environment|Mainly shallow marine high-energy environment associatead with penecontemporaneous volcanic activity.|
24563|Warramana Sandstone|Relationships and boundaries|Assigned to the Tawallah Group, McArthur Basin. Conformably overlies the Wollogorang Formation or, where locally present, the Gold Creek Volcanics. Contact picked at the incoming of red, medium-grained, lithic sandstone above finer siliciclastic and carbonate rocks or volcanics of the underlying units. Conformably overlain by Tanumbirini Rhyolite or disconformably by Nyanantu Formation. The Masterton Sandstone overlies with an unconformable relationship at one section.|
24563|Warramana Sandstone|Age reasons|Statherian based on 1713 +/- 6 Ma age of conformably overlying Tanumbirini Rhyolite (Haines and others, in press).|

24565|Wauchope Subgroup|Comments|Remarks: Wauchope Subgroup is the middle of the three subgroups making up the Hatches Creek Group. It is more widespread than the underlying Ooradidgee Subgroup, and rests on basement where the Ooradidgee Subgroup is absent. In contrast to the interfingering volcanic and fluvial formations comprising the Ooradidgee Subgroup, it has a general layer-cake stratigraphy with only a minor degree of interfingering, and volcanics are less abundant. Sedimentary environments were mixed fluvial and near-shore marine. Its top is marked by an abrupt change from basaltic lavas to ridge forming sandstone of the overlying Hanlon Subgroup.|

Type area contains calcareous argillites, with rare stratiform stromatolites, carbonaceous and pyritic aragillites, minor calc-arenites, quaratzites and calcareous para-amphibolites.|
24572|Whites Formation|Extent|Poorly exposed; outcrop mainly confined to an area 20 km by 5 km in the northwestern part of the Batchelor 1:100 000 Sheet (5171) and the southwestern part of the Noonamah 1:100 000 Sheet (5172).|

24573|Wickstead Creek beds|Type section locality|Point 293700E, 7505600N in bed of Wallaby Creek, E edge of Napperby 1:100 000 Sheet area - folded calc-silicate engulfed by Napperby Gneiss.|
24573|Wickstead Creek beds|Extent|SE part of Reynolds Range in Aileron, Tea Tree, Reynolds Range, and Napperby 1:100 000 Sheet areas. Tawo parallel major outcrop belts have been mapped, one along S edge of Reynolds Range W of Wickstead Creek, the other to the N in the body of the Reynolds Range, extending E & W from the S vicinity of Mount Dunkin. The two belts are disrupted at W ends by Napperby Gneiss, and large masses of calc-silicate form a belt of remnants in Gneiss, and form an almost continuous string, suggesting that two belts were originally one belt, folded and later disrupted.|
24573|Wickstead Creek beds|Thickness range|Unknown; no more than 1000 m (width of total outcrop).|
24573|Wickstead Creek beds|Lithology|Interbedded and strongly folded calc-silicate rock (epidote-quartz, garnet-zoisite-diopside-quartz, epidote-garnet-calcite), diopside marble, biotite schist, biotite-sillimanite-quartz-plagioclase-microcline granofels.|
24573|Wickstead Creek beds|Relationships and boundaries|In S part of Reynolds Range 1:100 0000 Sheet area, isolated outcrops of Wickstead Creek beds are interspersed with isolated outcrops of Lander Rock beds, and are therefore interpreted as a calcareous facies of, and interfingering with the Lander Rock beds. Wickstead Creek beds adjoin Mount Thomas Quartzite, but relationship not exposed. Elsewhere, Mount Thomas Quartzite unconformably overlies Lander Rock beds, and so presumably unconformably overlies Wickstead Creek beds. Intruded by Napperby Gneiss.|
24573|Wickstead Creek beds|Identifying features|Reason for Proposed Name: A distinctive and easily mapped calc-silicate unit, very different from adjoining granulites, granites, and gneisses of metapelitic character.|
24573|Wickstead Creek beds|Age reasons|If correlation with Lander Rock beds is correct, Wickstead Creek beds were deposited in Early Proterozoic (or earlier). Are older than Napperby Gneiss which is dated at 1800-1500 m.y. by Rb-Sr muscovite and whole rock (L P Black, BMR, pers. comm., 1975).|

37739|Wild Cow Subgroup|Age reasons|Meaningful radiometric dating is currently unavailable for any part of the South Nicholson Group (SNG) and its age is therefore internally unconstrained. The maximum age of 1595+/-6 Ma is that of the Lawn Hill Formation at the top of the immediately underlying McNamara Group (Page and Sweet 1998). There are no minimum age constraints imposed by overlying units, apart from the late Neoproterozoic to Phanerozoic Georgina Basin. The interpreted age range of the whole SNG, and by default for the Wild Cow Subgroup, of 1500 to 1400 Ma, is based on correlation of the SNG with the Roper Group of the southern McArthur Basin. These two groups, combined, make up the Roper superbasin (Jackson et al 1999, Abbott et al 2001).|06/FEB/12

37739|Wild Cow Subgroup|Comments|This package of rocks has been accorded subgroup status because a disconformity, locally an angular unconformity, has been recognised within the South Nicholson Group. The Wild Cow Subgroup constitutes all of the SNG below that unconformity. The upper SNG (the Accident Creek Subgroup) also has distinctly different facies patterns and depocentres from the Wild Cow Subgroup. Reference section: A composite section from south to north in the Mitchiebo Waterhole area provides a convenient representation of the Subgroup. It includes the Playford Sandstone type section (see that definition for details), and a separate segment covering the Crow Formation, around latitude 18o39'S longitude 137o6'E: from Mitchiebo Waterhole, at 721222E 7937170N (base), for 1.8 km to the northeast, to 722522E 7938570N (top). Note: All locations are based on the GDA94 geodetic datum. Standard series 1:250 000 sheet names are shown in upper case.|06/FEB/12

23244|Woodah Sandstone|Type section locality|Lower boundary stratotype: Western sides of Morgan Island, lat. 13o 28'S, long. 136o 05'E (GR PF183105).|
23244|Woodah Sandstone|Extent|Eastern BLUE MUD BAY. Main outcrops on Morgan Island, Burney and northern Bickerton Islands, Isle Woodah, Grindall Point and near Cape Barrow.|
23244|Woodah Sandstone|Thickness range|Thickest exposure is 50-60m at Morgan Island, where the top is eroded.|
23244|Woodah Sandstone|Lithology|Isle Woodah- sandstone: pink and white, medium-grained, medium- to thick-bedded, flat- to cross-bedded, quartz rich. Burney Island- basal cobble to boulder conglomerate: polymict, interbedded with coarse- to very coarse-grained, pebbly sandstone. Bickerton Island- lower unit of mudstone: red-brown, micaeous, interbedded with medium- to coarse-grained snadstone, thin-bedded, ripples, desiccation crack. Upper unit of sandstone: white to pink, medium-grained, quartz-rich matrix, larger clasts polymict. Cape Barrow- sandstone: coarse-grained and pebbly, grades into conglomerate: medium-bedded, cross-bedded, quartz-rich matrix, larger clasts polymict.|
23244|Woodah Sandstone|Relationships and boundaries|Assigned to the base of the Alyangula Subgroup of the Groote Eylandt Group. Lies unconformably on Grindall Formation and it intrusives (Bradshaw Complex and Bukudal Granite). Outcrops tentatively indentified as Woodah Sandstone are inferred to br overlain by Bartalumba Basalt on eastern Bickerton Island, although the contact is not exposed.|
23244|Woodah Sandstone|Age reasons|Probably Statherian (Palaeoproterozoic), but not well constrained. A maximum constraint is provided by the ~1815 Ma age of the Bickerton Rhyolite (Pietsch et al. 1994), near the base of the underlying Bustard Subgroup.|
23244|Woodah Sandstone|Correlations|Considered to be a lateral equivalent of the Alyinga Sandstone.|

72422|Woodalla Member|Depositional environment|Deep-water marine, turbiditic.|
72422|Woodalla Member|Relationships and boundaries|Base not exposed. Laterally equivalent to Mount Stafford Member near Tin Bore in NAPPERBY. However, Mount Stafford Member is a higher metamorphic-grade equivalent of Woodalla Member.|
72422|Woodalla Member|Structure and Metamorphism|Polydeformed, with generally moderately to steeply dipping bedding or S1 foliation.|
72422|Woodalla Member|Age reasons|Late Orosirian. Correlative Mount Stafford Member has maximum age of sedimentation of 1869 Ma based on its youngest coherent group of detrital zircons, 1866  3 Ma (Claou-Long et al in press). Correlative Lander Rock Formation in MOUNT DOREEN has similar maximum age of sedimentation, ie 1868 Ma based on youngest coherent group of detrital ages of 1862  6 Ma (Claou-Long et al in press).|
72422|Woodalla Member|Correlations|Correlated with turbiditic (and locally high-grade equivalent) undivided Lander Rock Formation in MOUNT DOREEN and with Mount Stafford Member in MOUNT PEAKE and NAPPERBY. Woodalla Member may correlate with widespread (probably turbiditic) undivided Lander Rock Formation in western Aileron Province of Arunta Region.|

24584|Woodforde River beds|Relationships and boundaries|Adjoins with apparent conformity metapelitic granulite, but along strike to NW where metamorphic grade lessens, facings in same Pine Hill outcrop indicate it underlies Woodforde River beds. Top of Woodforde River beds not preserved, because it occupies core of syncline. Occupies similar stratigraphic position to Algamba Dolomite Member of Pine Hill Formation, and so is correlated with Algamba Dolomite Member. Continuity of outcrop between Woodforde River beds and Algamba Dolomite Member not preserved (if it ever existed). Intruded by unnamed granite which may be off-shoot of Napperby Gneiss.|

Early Proterozoic or older, but no evidence for or against this) - see submission on Pine Hill Formation and Algamba Dolomite Member. Time of metamorphism not known with certainty, presumably late Early or early Middle Proterozoic. Older than granite intruding it, and certainly older than Napperby Gneiss, which intrudes Pine Hill Formation nearby and is dated at 1800-1500 m.y. (L P Black, BMR, pers. comm., 1975).|

24592|Yakalibadgi Microgranite|Type section locality|Point GR 5453-660366, 8 km NW of Mount Thomas, Reynolds Range 1:100 0000 Sheet area (sample point C726B on Prelim. Geol. Map). Good exposure of foliated dark grey microgranodiorite with small biotite-rich xenoliths.|
24592|Yakalibadgi Microgranite|Extent|SW side of NW part of Reynolds Range, from vicinity of Mt Thomas NW-wards; may extend NW into adjoining Denison 1:100 000 sheet.|
24592|Yakalibadgi Microgranite|Lithology|Porphyritic microgranite somewhat retrogressively metamorphosed, consisting of feldspar (sericitized), quartz, biotite, muscovite, zircon, tourmaline, apatite + opaque mineral. Phenocrysts consist of quartz and sericitized plagioclase. Microcline only in groundmass. Grades SE into medium-grained (near Mount Thomas) at SE end of body, and to NW into biotite schist and biotite-muscovite schist as retrogression and deformation obliterate original texture - original phenocrysts survive as quartz and plagioclase. augen. Bulk chemical analyses of 3 samples indicate granodiorite composition.|
24592|Yakalibadgi Microgranite|Relationships and boundaries|Intrudes Lander Rock beds. Adjoins base of basal conglomerate of Mount Thomas Quartzite with apparent concordance, but is regarded as intrusive into Mount Thomas Quartzite because at several other places the base of Mt Thomas Quartzite has acted as a barrier to granitic intrusions but which are known to breach the barrier in a few localities.|
24592|Yakalibadgi Microgranite|Identifying features|Reason for Proposed Name: A distinctive and easily mapped fine-grained granitic body.|
24592|Yakalibadgi Microgranite|Age reasons|Younger than Lander Rock beds (Early Proterozoic or older), almost certainly younger than Mount Thomas Quartzite (which unconformably overlies Lander Rock beds), older than regional metamorphism of Mount Thomas Quartzite, which was subsequently intruded by Napperby Gneiss (dated at 1800-1500 m.y. by Rb-Sr muscovite and whole rock (and Mount Airy Orthogneiss (undated). Hence, late Early Proterozoic or early Middle Proterozoic (Early Carpentarian). K-Ar date of 920 m.y. on biotite from SE part of body probably partly reset by Alice Springs Orogeny (Carboniferous).|

23289|Yanungbi Volcanics|Name source|Yanungbi outstation (AMG PG803417), on the southwestern coast of Melville Bay, in the Gove 1:250 000 scale mapsheet area.|
23289|Yanungbi Volcanics|Unit history|Previously undifferentiated "Spencer Creek Volcanics" of Dunnet (1965).|
23289|Yanungbi Volcanics|Geomorphic expression|Typically recessive outcrop of blocks, boulders and low rubbly rises.|
23289|Yanungbi Volcanics|Type section locality|Along Spencer Creek at lat. 12o21'10"S, long. 136o26'50"E (AMG PG574340, Arnhem Bay), where they comprise relatively fresh outcrop overlain unconformably by Mount Bonner Sandstone. Lower boundary stratotype along a linear resistant ridge between PG555405 and PG574407, which marks an unconformable contact between the Dhalinybuy Granite and relatively fine-grained banded and autobrecciated rhyolite of the Yanungbi Volcanics. This is interpreted as the base of a flow unit, sitting immediately above the granite with unconformity.|
23289|Yanungbi Volcanics|Extent|Outcrop is restricted to two areas. The principal area is in the lower reaches of Spencer Creek and Cato River (~PG574340, northeastern Arnhem Bay 1:250 000 scale mapsheet area), 10 km northeast of Dhalinybuy outstation. A second area of outcrop lies to the northeast in the vicinity of Mount Bonner (PG700600, northwestern Gove 1).|
23289|Yanungbi Volcanics|Thickness range|200 m. This unit has been locally eroded or removed prior to deposition of the overlying Gove Sandstone and Mount Bonner Sandstone. Poor exposure suggests the sequence is locally much thicker.|
23289|Yanungbi Volcanics|Lithology|Pink, red or brown felsic igneous rock (rhyolite). It is aphyric to porphyritic with phenocrysts of K-feldspar. Localised development of contorted flow-banding and autobreccia. Local lens-shaped intrusions of aphyric rhyolite. Where this unit merges with the Latram Granite (e.g., PG563389) the texture becomes noticeably coarser and granophyric. These two are also petrologically and geochemically closely related (i.e. comagmatic). Also rare microdolerite.|
23289|Yanungbi Volcanics|Depositional environment|Mainly extrusive but appears to be partly shallow intrusive, merging with the sub-volcanic Latram Granite. The extrusive rocks were probably emplaced by passive effusive processes as subaerial lava domes and coolees.|
23289|Yanungbi Volcanics|Relationships and boundaries|Basal formation of the Spencer Creek Group. They lie unconformably on the metamorphic and granitic rocks of the Bradshaw Complex and the Orosirian Dhalinybuy Granite, and are in turn disconformably overlain by the quartzose Gove Sandstone. At the lower boundary stratotype, resistant fine-grained banded and autobrecciated rhyolite of the Yanungbi Volcanics, interpreted as the base of a flow unit, unconformably overlies the Dhalinybuy Granite. Nearby, similar aphyric rhyolite intrudes this granite. A weak thermal aureole has developed around the thicker intrusive bodies, resulting in low-grade contact metamorphism of the granite. The Yanungbi Volcanics are disconformably overlain by lithic and quartzose sandstones of the Gove Sandstone. At PG570420, the Gove Sandstone has removed the volcanic unit and sits unconformably on Dhalinybuy Granite. In other areas, all of the overlying formations of the Spencer Creek Group have been removed by erosion preceding deposition of the Mount Bonner Sandstone, and Yanungbi Volcanics are overlain unconformably by this coarse-grained siliciclastic unit.|
23289|Yanungbi Volcanics|Age reasons|Palaeoproterozoic (Statherian). Interpreted to be comagmatic with the Latram Granite, which has an age of ~1710 Ma (Rawlings and others, in prep.), determined by single grain SHRIMP U-Pb geochronological techniques.|
23289|Yanungbi Volcanics|Correlations|Rawlings and others (in prep.) and Rawlings (1994) suggest correlation with the upper parts of the Tawallah and Katherine River Groups in the southern and western McArthur Basin respectively. Locally, they correlate with the felsic igneous Fagan Volcanics in southern Arnhem Bay and northern Blue Mud Bay, and tentatively with the Gadabara Volcanics in eastern Blue Mud Bay mapsheet areas. These correlations are based on geochemical, petrological, lithostratigraphic and geochronological constraints, and the physical form of igneous units.|

23310|Yirrkala Formation|Name source|From Yirrkala, the old mission site on the Gove Peninsula in far northeastern Arnhem Land, at 12o15'05"S, 136o53'20"E.|
23310|Yirrkala Formation|Unit history|In places this unit is lithologically similar to, but not stratigraphically equivalent to, rocks described by Skwarko (1966) as 'unit A' of his 'inland belt', and was included within the Mullaman Beds. Use of the name Mullaman Beds has been discouraged (Hughes, 1978) due to the recognised stratigraphc inadequacy of the term in its original form, where it was used to describe most Mesozoic rocks in the northeastern Northern Territory. The name Yirrkala Formation was initially proposed to describe nonmarine rocks in Arnhem Land, but it also applies to rocks distributed much farther to the south along the western margin of the Gulf of Carpentaria, south until the Northern Territory/Queensland border. It is anticipated that further mapping will amost certainly extend the known westward distribution of the unit.|
23310|Yirrkala Formation|Geomorphic expression|Palaeoenvironment: The unit generally represents high-energy fluvial deposition in channels, and coarse-grained valley fills. Most outcrops conform to sandy bedform, channel, and gravel bar architectural elements in Miall's (1985) classification of fluvial deposits.|
23310|Yirrkala Formation|Type section locality|Lower boundary stratotype: Base of a 7.5 m interval of orange, coarse-grained, trough cross-bedded sandstone exposed along the banks of Wonga Creek, about 40 km southwest of Nhulunbuy at 12o29'15"S, 136o34'00"E on the Arnhem Bay-Gove 1:250 000 Sheet. The base of the unit is identified by a prominent disconformity with several metres of erosional relief. Immediately beneath the disconformity are pale coloured rocks of the Walker River Formation.  Reference Section: 50 m of white sandstone exposed along the banks and to the sides of 'Tiger Creek', at approximately 13o31'30"S, 135o14'50"E on the eastern flank of the Parsons Range on the Blue Mud Bay-Port Langdon 1:250 000 Sheet. The local formation base is identified by a chert cobble and pebble conglomeratic lag, mantling a well developed angular unconformity on the Palaeoproterozoic Parsons Range Group. The upper boundary of the unit was not observed, but is likely to occur a short distance above the top of the measured section.|
23310|Yirrkala Formation|Extent|The unit occurs in two main areas. Firstly, as a broad semi-continuous low-lying plateau in the northeastern part of the Arnhem Bay-Gove 1:250 000 Sheet area, between Melville Bay and Wanyamera Point, and Arnhem Bay and Dalywoi Bay. The exposed area of this plateau (now partly dissected) is about 1500 km2. The greatest thickness and extent of the Yirrkala Formation occurs on the Arnhem Bay-Gove 1:250 000 Sheet, in an area within about 50 km to the southwest of Nhulunbuy. Secondly, the unit occurs as thinner, patchy palaeovalley fill and terraced deposits in the elevated parts of high-standing basement ranges. The unit has been recognised on the upper flanks of the Mitchell Range and Parsons Range on the Blue Mud Bay-Port Langdon 1:250 000 Sheet, and also in the elevated parts of the Yiyintyi Range on the Mount Young 1:250 000 Sheet at about latitude 15o25'S.|
23310|Yirrkala Formation|Thickness range|Range 5 to 50 m: typically 8 to 15 m in outcrop, but probably much thicker in the subsurface, as shown in drill logs for 3 stratigraphic drillholes in the area surrounding Nhulunbuy (Dodson, 1967).|
23310|Yirrkala Formation|Lithology|Sandstone: white to pale grey, poorly to moderately sorted, fine- to very coarse-grained: massive to thickly planar bedded, with large-scale trough cross-bedding with set thicknesses up to 2 m at the base, and planar cross-bedding in the middle and upper parts with rare dispersed rounded pebble-sized chert clasts. Commonly forms fining-upward grain-size cycles, with chert pebble lags overlying local base-of-channel scours. Upper, finer-grained parts of the unit (or sub-cycles within the unit) contain rare, moderately to poorly preserved external moulds of segmented plant fossils on upper bedding surfaces.|
23310|Yirrkala Formation|Depositional environment|The unit generally represents high-energy fluvial deposition in channels, and coarse-grained valley fills. Most outcrops conform to sandy bedform, channel, and gravel bar architectural elements in Miall's (1985) classification of fluvial deposits.|
23310|Yirrkala Formation|Relationships and boundaries|In most exposures the unit overlies marine rocks of the Walker River Formation with disconformity or Palaeoproterozoic sedimentary rocks with angular unconformity. In the subsurface the unit overlies Proterozoic metasediments and granites with nonconformity (Dodson, 1967).|
23310|Yirrkala Formation|Age reasons|Plant macrofloras collected from this unit are relatively poorly preserved and consist of long-ranging forms, which may only be considered as Late Mesozoic in age (cf. Skwarko, 1966). The unit is correlated with the nonmarine sequence in three stratigraphic drillholes near Nhulunbuy; siltstone interbedded with the arkosic sandstones in drillhole DDH2 at 64 m depth has been dated by palynology as late Albian (Evans, in Dodson, 1967). Furthermore, on the basis of regional lithostratigraphic correlations, outcrops of the unit in the Wonga Creek area, about 40 km southwest of Nhulunbuy, disconformably overlie marine Cretaceous rocks of Albian age (Krassay, 1994). Therefore, the likely age of the unit in most places is Albian or younger (up to Cenomanian).|

The base of the section is the lower boundary stratotype at PG650510 and the top of the section is at PG636512. However, no top boundary stratotype is defined due to lack of an exposed upper contact.|
23312|Yuduyudu Formation|Extent|Outcrop is confined to a very small area 18 km northwest of Yanungbi outstation, in northeastern Arnhem Bay and northwestern Gove 1:250 000 scale mapsheet areas.|
23312|Yuduyudu Formation|Thickness range|150 to 250 m at the type section. To the north and south, the sequence has been removed by the unconformity at the base of the overlying Mount Bonner Sandstone.|
23312|Yuduyudu Formation|Lithology|Outcrop is very poor, and comprises scattered scree and slabs of pink quartzose or brown ferruginous lithic fine-grained sandstone and mudstone, and  minor medium-grained sandstone. The outcrop pattern suggests these are interbedded on a metre-scale. Otherwise, little is known of its rock types and internal stratigraphy.|
23312|Yuduyudu Formation|Depositional environment|The quality of outcrop does not permit an accurate assessment of the environment of deposition, but a shallow-water low-energy setting is envisaged.|
23312|Yuduyudu Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Middle sedimentary formation of the Spencer Creek Group. Apparently conformable between the Gove Sandstone and Cato Volcanics. The lower contact is marked by a gradation from clean white sandstone into more ferruginous and lithic sandstone and mudstone. The contact with overlying Cato Volcanics is very poorly exposed and is tentatively interpreted as conformable to mildly disconformable. Along strike, beyond the current exposures, the Yuduyudu Formation is probably unconformably overlain by Mount Bonner Sandstone.|
23312|Yuduyudu Formation|Age reasons|Palaeoproterozoic (Statherian). Constrained by the underlying and overlying Yanungbi and Cato Volcanics, which are ~1710 Ma (Rawlings and others, in prep.).|
23312|Yuduyudu Formation|Correlations|Rawlings and others (in prep.) and Rawlings (1994) suggest correlation with the upper parts of the Tawallah and Katherine River Groups in the southern and western McArthur Basin respectively. Locally, it correlates with the Fagan Volcanics in southern Arnhem Bay and northern Blue Mud Bay mapsheet areas.|

27310|Zamu Dolerite|Relationships and boundaries|Mainly conformable sills folded and in most places metamorphosed with the enclosing strata by a regional 1800 m.y. event. Chilled margins evident where unmetamorphosed, and host rocks metamorphosed. Truncated by early Carpentarian granites and invaded?? by granitic veins in places. Unconformably overlain by Edith River Volcanics and Kombolgie Formation of early Carpentarian age.|
