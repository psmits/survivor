4408|Comstock Formation|Name source|Initial Statement: This unit was defined in Corbett et al. (1974) as the Comstock Tuff, and was later referred to as the Comstock Formation (Corbett 1975, Corbett and Brown 1976), but was never registered at the Central Register of Australian Stratigraphic Names.  The aim of this application is to formally register this unit as the 'Comstock Formation' in order to allocate formal member names to two sub-units defined within the formation. The details given here are reasonably consistent with details given by Corbett et al. (1974) for the Comstock Tuff. However, more updated descriptions and other detailed information is also given. The Comstock Formation is the lowermost of two formations which make up the Tyndall Group. A full description of the Tyndall Group stratigraphy is given in White and McPhie (in prep).

Also Lyell Comstock Mine (often referred to as Comstock Mine) AMG Grid Reference 5344100N - 382100E.|
4408|Comstock Formation|Unit history|Comstock Tuff of Corbett et al. (1974).|
4408|Comstock Formation|Type section locality|The Comstock Formation was defined as the Comstock Tuff in the Comstock/Zig Zag Hill area by Corbett et al. (1974). A type section was given in Corbett et al. (1974) and is situated on Zig Zag Hill between 82535, 36115 (base) and 82535, 36175 (top; Lyell 1:63 360 sheet). The top of the Comstock Tuff as defined by Corbett et al. (1974), occurs at the base of a unit of laminated pink siltstone on Zig Zag Hill. However, more Comstock-type sandstone and breccia is exposed above this siltstone unit (as noted by Corbett et al. 1974) and therefore the top of the unit is more likely to be approximately 100-130 metres stratigraphically higher, at the top of the welded ignimbrite unit. The Zig Zag Hill Formation (new term) (referred to as the Jukes Formation by Corbett et al. 1974) sharply overlies the welded ignimbrite unit on Zig Zag Hill and contains deposits that have a different origin to deposits in the underlying Comstock Formation (as explained in White and McPhie in prep). The Comstock Formation is dominated by syn-eruptive crystal-rich volcaniclastic deposits and is clearly different to the overlying Jukes Formation dominated by post-eruptive polymict volcaniclastic conglomerate and sandstone.  I suggest that a type area be assigned to the Comstock Formation (i.e. the Comstock/Zig Zag Hill area) as the old type section on Zig Zag Hill is largely overgrown with vegetation and better exposures are seen 1 km to the southeast in the Comstock area and in the Comstock drill holes (e.g. C50: 477-1003 feet, C61: 222-407 m). On Zig Zag Hill, the Comstock Formation dips steeply to the northeast and is exposed between 5345800N - 381750E (base) and 5346200N - 382400E (top) (AMG Grid co-ordinates, Gormanston sheet, Tasmania 1:25 000 series, Tasmanian Lands Department)|17/JAN/07
4408|Comstock Formation|Extent|The Comstock Formation is exposed in the central part of the Mount Read Volcanics from the Lynchford area to the Mount Lyell district, and further north in the Anthony Road/Henty Canal and Moxon Saddle areas. Correlates of the Comstock Formation occur in the Mount Cripps Subgroup (Corbett 1992) in the Cradle Mountain Link Road area. Other correlates occur in the Winterbrook area (Pemberton and Vicary 1989) and possibly in parts of the Western Volcanosedimentary sequences (e.g. Pinnacles area, McKibben 1993). Correlates may also occur further south in the Jukes-Darwin area (Corbett 1992).  However, some of these units are more recently interpreted as part of the Eastern quartz-phyric sequence (Corbett et al. 1993).|
4408|Comstock Formation|Thickness range|The Comstock Formation varies in thickness from approximately 200 m (Comstock area) to 800 m thick (Henty Canal, Cradle Mountain Link Road areas). Thinner, incomplete sequences are also exposed in parts of the Mount Read Volcanics (e.g. near the Mount Lyell Mill).|
4408|Comstock Formation|Lithology|The Comstock Formation is dominated by massive crystal-rich volcaniclastic sandstone and massive to normally graded crystal-, lithic-rich volcaniclastic lithic breccia units. Minor facies include laminated and graded fine sandstone/mudstone units, carbonate (fossiliferous in places; Jago et al. 1972), welded ignimbrite, ignimbrite-clast volcaniclastic breccia, coherent rhyolite (flow banded in places) and rhyolite clast volcaniclastic breccia. The lower part is derived largely from andesitic to dacitic volcanism (Lynchford Member) while the upper part is derived largely from rhyolitic to dacitic volcanism (Mount Julia Member). Details are given in White and McPhie (in prep). Crystal-rich volcaniclastic facies containing approximately 1-5% titanomagnetite, dominate in this formation which gives it a characteristically high magnetic signature relative to the surrounding units. Corbett et al. (1974) defines the Comstock Tuff as comprising an interbedded sequence of quartz-keratophyric tuff, breccia, sandstone, shale and limestone.|
4408|Comstock Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The character of the lower contact (to older underlying rocks) appears to be conformable in some areas (e.g. Comstock, Anthony Road) where an interfingering contact to the underlying andesite units is observed. In some areas (e.g. Lynchford, Moxon Saddle) the Comstock Formation is interpreted to rest unconformably on, or in fault contact with older rocks of the Mount Read Volcanics. In other areas the contact is poorly defined due to poor exposure.  In areas of good exposure (e.g. Comstock, Anthony Road, Henty Canal), the upper contact of the Comstock Formation (with the overlying Zig Zag Hill Formation) is gradational and conformable.|
4408|Comstock Formation|Age reasons|The age is best constrained by fossil dating. Marine fossils found in a brown mudstone unit (largely trilobites) within the 'Comstock Formation correlates' on the Cradle Mountain Link Road are dated as late Middle Cambrian in age (Lejopyge laevigata II and III to Damesella torosa-Ascionepea janitrix zones) (Pemberton et al. 1991). The age range of these fossils is approximately 530 to 520 Ma (Shergold 1989). The fossiliferous carbonate (limestone) unit in the Comstock Formation at Comstock contains fauna of a similar age (late Middle to early Late Cambrian age: Jago et al. 1972). Recent isotopic U-Pb dating of magmatic zircons from 2 crystal-rich volcaniclastic sandstone samples in the Comstock Formation yielded two relatively young dates of 494.4+/-3.8 Ma and 502.5+/-3.3 Ma (Perkins and Walshe 1993).|

37828|Corn Hill Formation|Unit history|Corn Hills beds (Hills, 1982)|
37828|Corn Hill Formation|Geomorphic expression|Ranging from steep but low relief at type section to undulating farm land.|
37828|Corn Hill Formation|Description at type locality|146degrees49'50" E 41degrees15'56" S Bulls Road (off Rookery Road) Northern Tasmania.  The type locality is a substantial road cutting on the southern side of the road.  The site was that from which Banks and Rickards (1989) recovered graptolites and Hills (1982) recovered the remaining fauna and first described the unit.  It is the most substantial outcrop of the unit known although good exposure is available in drill cores DDH B48 and DDH B49 drilled for the purpose of geotechnical investigation of the Mill Site for the Beaconsfield Gold Mine held at the Beaconsfield Gold Mine core shed.|
37828|Corn Hill Formation|Extent|Flowery Gully - Leonardsburgh area, southwest of Beaconsfield, Northern Tasmania.|
37828|Corn Hill Formation|Thickness range|Indeterminate due to poor outcrop, folding complexity truncation by faulting but of the order of 600m.|
37828|Corn Hill Formation|Lithology|Foliated micaceous shaley quartz siltstone with lesser quartzwacke sandstone, siltstone and shale beds of turbiditic character.|
37828|Corn Hill Formation|Depositional environment|Moderately deep water (probably outer shelf) turbidites.|
37828|Corn Hill Formation|Fossils|Monograptus thomasi, Actinopteria meridionalis, Pracadium sp., Styliolina minuta and others of lesser significance.|
37828|Corn Hill Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Unconformably overlies the (as yet formally undefined) Johnson Creek siltstone of Silurian age (correlated with the Eldon Gp of Western Tasmania) and truncated above by Tabberabberan age Cabbage Tree Thrust.  Neither boundary is observable at the type locality.  The position of the lower boundary can be approximated due to the contrasting competency of the shaley Corn Hill Formation with respect to the more massive quartz sandstone at the top of the Johnson Creek siltstone in poor outcrop east of the Flowery Gully Road 500m due west of the type locality.  The boundary is considered to be an unconformity due to the constraints of contrasting lithology and faunal control, the Johnson Creek siltstone being of Early Silurian age (Hills, 1982).  The upper boundary of the Corn Hill Formation is a thrust juxtaposing it beneath a conformable sedimentary sequence of demonstrable Cambrian - Early Ordovician age (Jago, 1980; Laurie, 1996a; 1996b; 1998; Laurie and Hills, in prep.)  The position of the thrust is constrained within a few tens of metres along the western flank of the Cabbage Tree Hill - Salisbury Hill strike ridge immediately west of Beaconsfield and is constrained in drill core from the Beaconsfield Gold Mine (DDHs B13, B32 & B50) 7km NNW of the type locality where it occurs as a sheared pug and hydrothermal alteration zone over several metres thickness.  It is thought that the thrust represents a major fluid path for gold mineralisation.  The drill holes do not penetrate the thrust.  The thrust outcrops poorly as a zone of shearing and clay pug over a width of 1m in a road cutting 500m northeast of the type locality where Ordovician sediments overlie the Corn Hill Formation.|07/FEB/11

Sedimentary structures such as slumping, flute casting, current bedding and small scale erosional cut-offs are common-place at the type locality and elsewhere.  The flute casting and current bedding in particular indicated deposition from the west-southwest.|

5328|Deep Creek Volcanics|Name source|Deep Creek, the former name of Washington Creek, which enters the Whyte River 2 km south of Luina (CQ645061), Arthur River 1:100000 topographic sheet (7915), Luina 1:25000 topographic sheet (3640) and geological sheet (Everard 2003).|
5328|Deep Creek Volcanics|Unit history|The term  "Deep Creek Basic Volcanics Formation" was used by Cox (1968) and Cox and Glasson (1971) for the mafic volcanic sequence cropping out southeast of the Cleveland Mine, and "Whyte Hill Basic Volcanics Formation" was applied by Cox (1968) for similar but less extensive mafic volcanics cropping out on Whyte Hill (CQ686078). Other terms used in the Cleveland Mine area have been the "lavas" (Hughes 1953), the "Basic Volcanics Formation" (Glasson and Hopwood 1962; Cox and Glasson 1967), the "massive volcanics" (Mason 1965), the "basic volcanic unit" (Ranson and Hunt 1975) and the "Deep Creek basic volcanics" (Palmer 1976); all coincide with and are superseded by Deep Creek Volcanics.|07/JUN/11
5328|Deep Creek Volcanics|Geomorphic expression|Tends to form high ground, particularly in contrast to the overlying Hall Formation.|
5328|Deep Creek Volcanics|Type section locality|The type section is in Washington Creek (formerly Deep Creek) between CQ650065 and CQ665072. A reference section is also designated in "Falls Creek" (CQ646054 to CQ652047) and a short reference section occurs at the summit of Whyte Hill (CQ688079)(Collins 1983).|07/JUN/11
5328|Deep Creek Volcanics|Extent|Exposed for about 4 km2 in the Cleveland Mine area, between Washington Creek and "Falls Creek" and on Whyte Hill (Everard 2003). Elsewhere, the unit has not been fully differentiated from other constituent formations of the Luina Group.|
5328|Deep Creek Volcanics|Thickness range|Probably over 600m southeast of the Cleveland Mine; the reference section in "Falls Creek" is 350m thick. However, the base is nowhere exposed and, on the other hand, any estimate may be exaggerated by faulting (Collins 1983).|07/JUN/11
5328|Deep Creek Volcanics|Lithology|Massive and locally pillowed spilitic basalt flow, with intercalated and interbedded fine-grained and lapilli tuff, volcaniclastic greywacke, red to chocolate-brown argillite and minor red-grey-green chert (Collins 1983).|
5328|Deep Creek Volcanics|Depositional environment|Probably deep water, pelagic or continental slope.|
5328|Deep Creek Volcanics|Fossils|None known|
5328|Deep Creek Volcanics|Diastems or hiatuses|Not known|
5328|Deep Creek Volcanics|Relationships and boundaries|Conformably overlain by the Hall Formation to the west. To the east, it is faulted against serpentinised mafic-ultramafic rocks at Whyte Hill. To the southeast (e.g. in "Falls Creek") it is bounded by a turbiditic greywacke sequence similar to the Crescent Spur Sandstone, but the nature of this boundary is unknown (Collins 1983).|
5328|Deep Creek Volcanics|Structure and Metamorphism|Igneous clinopyroxene and calcic plagioclase are partly replaced by a greenschist facies including albite-oligoclase-actinolite, chlorite, titanite, epidote, calcite, magnetite, ilmenite (?) and sulphides (Collins 1983).|
5328|Deep Creek Volcanics|Age reasons|Considered "Eocambrian(?)-Early Cambrian(?)" by Collins (1983); now considered probably Early Cambrian, possibly Late Neoproterozoic (see Luina Group).|
5328|Deep Creek Volcanics|Correlations|Basalts in the Ramsay River and upper Arthur River/Wandle River areas may be correlates (Brown 1986; Williams & Brown 1983).  A suggested correlation with basalts intercalated with the Crimson Creek Formation (Collins 1983) is now considered unlikely (e.g. Brown and Jenner 1988; Brown 1989, p. 64).|
5328|Deep Creek Volcanics|Alteration and Mineralisation|In the Cleveland Mine area, alteration of relict clinopyroxene to actinolite and albitised plagioclase to quartz, sericite, chlorite and minor biotite defines a halo adjacent to cassiterite-sulphide mineralisation. The halo is also defined by an increase in Rb, Sn and Zn and depletion of Na2O and K2O (Collins 1983).|
5328|Deep Creek Volcanics|Geophysical Expression|Associated with moderate to strong anomalies on aeromagnetic images.|
5328|Deep Creek Volcanics|Geochemistry|Basaltic (e.g. SiO2~ 46-50%, MgO~ 5-7%). Possibly three groups with ~1.6%, 2.5% and 3.7% TiO2 can be distinguished. Immobile element ratios (e.g. Nb/Y, Zr/P2O5) are characteristic of tholeiites. Weakly LEE-enriched((La/Yb)N 1.76-2.75) at 10-70 x chondrite (Collins 1983; Everard in Corbett et al. 2011).|

Contacts with the Yolande River Sequence probably faulted. Possibly allochthonous and tectonically emplaced in the Early Cambrian, before deposition of the Yolande River Sequence.|
75977|Guilfoyle Creek Basalt|Identifying features|Distinguished from mafic units in the Mt Read Volcanics (e.g. Lynch Creek Basalt) by geochemistry (see below) and ophitic microtexture.|

7994|Halls Formation|Name source|Hall's workings, the original main open cut and underground workings on Hall's lode, lens A of the Cleveland Mine, on the south east flank of Godkin Ridge, CQ652069).|
7994|Halls Formation|Unit history|The term "Hall's Formation" was originally used by Cox (1968) and Cox and Glasson (1971) for a single repetitive unit up to 30m thick containing a single "lode bed". The equivalent terms "Lode Formation" (Glasson and Hopwood 1962; Cox and Glasson 1967) and "lode horizon" (Mason 1965) have also been used for this unit. Ransom (1972) and Ransom and Hunt (1975) re-interpreted the structure at the mine and defined a "lode-bearing unit" 50-100m thick, which was later designated as "Hall's formation" by Palmer (1976). The Halls Formation also coincides with the "slate" of Hughes (1953).|
7994|Halls Formation|Constituents|Includes Henrys Volcanic Member.|
7994|Halls Formation|Geomorphic expression|Subdued.|
7994|Halls Formation|Type section locality|The type section is a subsurface section at the Cleveland Mine (CQ651067), exposed in underground workings (e.g. mine section N) and in diamond drill core that was retained at the mine. Representative samples are held by Mineral Resources Tasmania and the University of Tasmania. A reference section occurs on Whyte Hill on the Corinna Road between CQ683080 and CQ686080 (Collins 1983; see also Everard 2003).|
7994|Halls Formation|Extent|Exposed for over 3 km2 on Whyte Hill, on the southeast flank of Crescent Spur and the east bank of the Whyte River south of Washington (formerly Deep) Creek; a fault-emplaced outlier occurs within the Deep Creek Volcanics east of the Cleveland Mine (Collins 1983). Outside the Cleveland Mine area, the unit has not been differentiated from other constituent formations of the Luina Group.|
7994|Halls Formation|Thickness range|80-120m in the Cleveland mine area. 50-150m quoted by Collins (1983, p. 64).|
7994|Halls Formation|Lithology|Light to dark grey and purple shale and fine-grained tuff, with limestone, grey-green-red chert, greywacke, basic tuff and basalt.|

7994|Halls Formation|Identifying features|Characterised by presence of limestone, which is not known in the underlying and overlying formations (Collins 1983, p. 64).|
7994|Halls Formation|Age reasons|Considered ¿Eocambrian(?)-Early Cambrian(?)¿ by Collins (1983); now considered probably Early Cambrian, possibly Late Neoproterozoic (see Luina Group).|
7994|Halls Formation|Correlations|A suggested correlation with the Crimson Creek Formation (Collins 1983) is now considered unlikely (e.g. Brown and Jenner 1988; Brown 1989, p. 64)|
7994|Halls Formation|Alteration and Mineralisation|At the Cleveland Mine, the unit contains eleven lenses of cassiterite-sulphide mineralisation, divided into two groups (footwall and hangingwall lodes) by a wedge of basalt, the Henrys Volcanic Member.|
7994|Halls Formation|Geochemistry|Chemical analyses indicate that the limestone beds are composed mainly of calcite (40-80%) and quartz or chert (10-42%)with only minor Fe, Mg and Mn (Collins 1983, p. 67).|

24364|Lottah Granite|Name source|From the hamlet of Lottah, 20 km northeast of St Helens, at GR855361 (Blue Tier 1:50 000 Sheet).|
24364|Lottah Granite|Unit history|Gee & Groves (1971), Groves (1972, 1977), and McClenaghan et al. (1982) included the Lottah Granite in a group of granite bodies of various types, interpreted to intrude the Poimena Granite and termed collectively the "Lottah Sheets".  Lottah Granite is essentially synonymous with "Lottah pluton" referred to by McClenaghan (1985) and the Lottah Alkali-Feldspar Granite referred to by McClenaghan (in press).|
24364|Lottah Granite|Type section locality|On the northern side of the bridge over Tin Dish Creek on Lottah Road (GR840361; Blue Tier). Lithology here is leucocratic zinnwaldite-topaz alkali-feldspar granite, typical of most of the Lottah Granite.|
24364|Lottah Granite|Description at type locality|Near a disused logging track 200 m south of Cotton Creek (GR13439; Ringarooma). Lithology is porphyritic muscovite-biotite alkali-feldspar granite, which occupies an elliptical area of about 6 km2 on the northern margin of the largest body.|
24364|Lottah Granite|Extent|The Lottah Granite crops out in two main areas. The larger, about 23 km2, extends in an irregular, crudely boomerang shape from GR846397 (Blue Tier), near Mt Michael, northwestward to a line between 817446 (Ringarooma 1:50 000) and 790444 (near Cross Creek) and west-northwestward to 790410 (approx.). From 790444 it extends southwestward, and from 790410 west-southwestward, to 748406, 1.5 km northwest of Weldborough. Small (0.4 to 1.2 km2) apophyses are centred on GR792448, 814409, 826389 (all Ringarooma), 844421, and 843391 (Blue Tier); numerous small apophyses and dykes are exposed in the upper reaches of Cotton Creek between 824433 and 836433.  The smaller body (about 6 km2) extends from the Anchor mine (GR848353; Blue Tier) westward to 821359 (Ringarooma) and northwestward to 824386. Both main bodies enclose or partly enclose several roof pendants (up to 2 km2) and apophyses (up to 1 km2) of the host Poimena Granite, particularly in the Emu Hill-Masher Hill area (around GR800420).|
24364|Lottah Granite|Lithology|The bulk of the Lottah Granite consists of even-grained (weakly porphyritic in few small areas), very leucocratic zinnwaldite-topaz alkali-feldspar granite (equigranular phase) with minor tourmaline, fluorite, apatite, cassiterite, amblygonite(?), and very rare monazite and zircon (and/or xenotime). Secondary muscovite and/or sericite and kaolinite are present in some areas. The 6 km2 elliptical body in the north consists of moderately to strongly porphyritic muscovite-biotite alkali-feldspar granite (porphyritic phase) with minor topaz, fluorite, apatite, zircon, monazite, and rare cassiterite. Secondary sericite, chlorite, and calcite are commonly present in small amounts.|
24364|Lottah Granite|Relationships and boundaries|The Lottah Granite intrudes the surrounding and, in places, overlying, Poimena Granite. It is intruded by dykes of dolerite (Devonian) and basalt (Tertiary), and overlain by Recent alluvial deposits.|
24364|Lottah Granite|Identifying features|The Lottah Granite is characterised by low relief, except in the north where it is incised by Cotton Creek and its tributaries, and moderate to poor outcrop. Outcrop is generally in the form of pavements; boulders and tors are rare.|
24364|Lottah Granite|Age reasons|The emplacement age of the Lottah Granite has been determined by means of Rb-Sr isotopes to be about 370 Ma (mid-Devonian: Mackenzie et al., in press).|
24364|Lottah Granite|Proposed publication|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta Introduction. The Lottah Granite as defined here is part of a group of granite bodies referred to collectively as the "Lottah Sheets" by Gee & Groves (1971), Groves (1972, 1977), and McClenaghan et al., (1982).  It is essentially the same as the bodies of alkali-feldspar granite referred to by McClenaghan (1985) as the "Lottah pluton". No name has been formally defined.|

75980|Luina Group|Name source|Township of Luina, now abandoned, near the type locality.|
75980|Luina Group|Unit history|Encompasses informal term Luina Beds (also beds) of Rubenach (1973). Equivalent to "Cleveland-Waratah association" of Williams (in Burrett & Martin 1989, p. 482) and variants of later authors (...Association, ...association and correlates, Cleveland Waratah Complex). Prior to 1989 was usually correlated with the Crimson Creek Formation (e.g. Brown 1986).|17/JUN/11
75980|Luina Group|Constituents|Three conformable formations: Deep Creek Volcanics (bottom), Halls Formation and Crescent Spur Sandstone (top)(Collins 1983).|17/JUN/11
75980|Luina Group|Type section locality|The type section is composite and is as for the constituent formations: Washington Creek (formerly Deep Creek) between CQ650065 and CQ665072; subsurface in the Cleveland Mine; and the north flank of Godkin Ridge on the Corinna Road, between CQ667085 and CQ683080 (Collins 1983; Everard 2003).|
75980|Luina Group|General description|Probably part of an allochthonous association that also includes the Heazlewood River and Mt Stewart Ultramafic Complexes and associated boninitic and low-titanium tholeiitic lavas.|
75980|Luina Group|Thickness range|> 1050 m (Deep Creek Volcanics  > 600 m; Halls Formation ~ 100 m; Crescent Spur Sandstone >/= 350 m)(Collins 1983).|17/JUN/11
75980|Luina Group|Lithology|Deep Creek Volcanics: massive, locally pillowed, spilitic, tholeiitic basalt, with interbedded tuff, volcaniclastic wacke, mudstone and chert. Halls Formation: grey and purple shale and fine-grained tuff, with limestone, chert, greywacke and basalt.  Crescent Spur Sandstone: turbiditic micaceous quartzose lithicwacke and interbedded siltstone and mudstone, with lesser mudstone, chert, basalt and tuff.|17/JUN/11
75980|Luina Group|Depositional environment|Probably deep water, pelagic or continental slope; the Crescent Spur Sandstone may represent the influx of turbidity currents containing material of continental derivation.|
75980|Luina Group|Fossils|None known|
75980|Luina Group|Diastems or hiatuses|Not known|
75980|Luina Group|Relationships and boundaries|Dips and faces northwest in the type area; the base (of Deep Creek Volcanics) is not exposed. Near Mt Bischoff, the Group contains large blocks of Oonah Formation near the faulted contact with that unit, suggesting the proximity of an unconformity (Williams in Seymour 1989). The top of the Crescent Spur Sandstone is faulted.|
75980|Luina Group|Identifying features|Deep Creek Volcanics and Hall Formation: Intercalated mafic volcanics, volcaniclastics, maroon to purple mudstone and chert; Crescent Spur Sandstone: micaceous quarzose lithicwacke with grains of quartzite, schist, muscovite, minor biotite and rare garnet indicative of a metasedimentary provenance.|
75980|Luina Group|Age reasons|Unfossiliferous; probably Early Cambrian. Intruded by feeder dykes for lavas, of which the Heazlewood River Ultramafic Complex represents cumulates.  A 513.6 +/- 5 Ma age (U-Pb SHRIMP on zircon, Black et al. 1997) from a tonalite from the Complex therefore places a minimum age constraint on the Luina Group. Contacts with older units are faulted and a Late Neoproterozoic age is possible.|
75980|Luina Group|Correlations|Probable correlates are present south and east of the Meredith Granite, between Mt Ramsay and Colebrook Hill, and in the Coldstream River-Boco area. Both are meridional, fault-bounded tracts of interbedded turbiditic volcaniclastic lithicwacke, tholeiitic lava flows and laminated siltstone and mudstone. A possible correlate lies in the Little Henty River-Avebury area, west of Zeehan. In northwest Tasmania, the Barrington Chert and overlying Motton Spilite are together a probable correlate.|
75980|Luina Group|Alteration and Mineralisation|In the type area, the Luina Group is affected by hydrothermal alteration related to Devonian granites. The Hall Formation hosts the Cleveland Sn-Cu orebodies.|
75980|Luina Group|Geophysical Expression|Basaltic units (incl. the Deep Creek Volcanics) are associated with moderate to strong anomalies on aeromagnetic images.|
75980|Luina Group|Geochemistry|Unaltered samples of the Deep Creek Volcanics are tholeiitic basalts transitional between E-MORB and rift tholeiites. Near the type area, three groups with ~1.6%, 2.5% and 3.7% TiO2 can be distinguished.|

29474|Lynchford Member|Name source|Initial Statement: The Lynchford Member is the lower member of two members in the Comstock Formation. The Comstock Formation is the lowermost of two formations in the Tyndall Group. The Lynchford Member correlates with the "Lynchford Tuff" defined by Corbett (1979). The unit is redefined herein and renamed the Lynchford Member. Lynchford (place name), 5 km southwest of Queenstown, western Tasmania (AMG Grid Reference 5336000N - 378000E Strahan sheet, Tasmania 1:25 000 series topographical map, Tasmanian Lands Department).|
29474|Lynchford Member|Unit history|Lynchford Tuff, Corbett (1979).|
29474|Lynchford Member|Type section locality|The type section is located in the Lynchford area, immediately east of the Queen River. The rocks dip steeply to the east and west, facing west, and are exposed along the Huxley Track between  5337500N - 379520E (base) and 5337800N - 378960E (top; Strahan sheet, Tasmania 1:25 000 series topographical map, Tasmanian Lands Department). A fault repetition exposes Lynchford Member facies further west along the Huxley Track. Corbett (1979) refers to this sequence of rocks as the Lynchford Tuff, and noted their similarity to the Comstock Tuff (Comstock Formation) deposits at Comstock. The Lynchford Member is approximately 600-700 m thick at the type section locality.|
29474|Lynchford Member|Extent|The Lynchford Member is well exposed in the central part of the Mount Read Volcanics, just northeast of Lynchford. It is also exposed in the Zig Zag Hill, Comstock, Anthony Road and Henty Canal/Howards Road areas. Possible correlates of the Lynchford Member occur in the Mount Cripps Subgroup in the Cradle Mountain Link Road area and possibly in parts of the Western Volcanosedimentary sequences (e.g. Pinnacles area, McKibben 1993).|
29474|Lynchford Member|Thickness range|The Lunchford Member varies in thickness from approximately 60 m (Comstock, Henty Canal area) to 600-700 m thick (Lynchford). The Tyndall Group sequence at Lunchford is composed entirely of quartz-poor crystal-rich volcaniclastic sandstone/breccia and laminated mudstone facies of the Lynchford Member (Lunchford Tuff, Corbett 1979). In the Anthony Road area, the Lynchford Member is approximately 200 m thick.|
29474|Lynchford Member|Lithology|The Lynchford Member forms the lower part of the Comstock Formation and comprises four main facies: 1) quartz-poor crystal-rich volcaniclastic sandstone;  2) laminated fine sandstone/mudstone;  3) volcaniclastic lithic breccia;  4) carbonate. The quartz-poor crystal-rich volcaniclastic sandstone facies is the most common facies in the Lynchford Member and occurs in the Lynchford, Comstock, Zig Zag Hill, Anthony Road and Henty Canal areas. The crystal-rich sandstone is generally massive and contains lenses of laminated fine sandstone and mudstone, and volcaniclastic lithic breccia. The crystal-rich facies contains abundant crystals and crystal fragments (35-70%), comprising largely plagioclase and  titanomagnetite, +/-clinopyroxene+/-ilmenite, with minor additions of quartz and angular felsic to mafic volcanic lithic clasts. The crystal composition suggests an andesitic to dacitic volcanic provenance. Crystal-rich volcaniclastic facies containing approximately 1-5% titanomagnetite, dominate in this member which gives it a characteristically high magnetic signature relative to the surrounding units.  Carbonate units mark the base of the Tyndall Group (Lynchford Member) at Comstock (Corbett et al. 1974) and in parts of the Anthony Road area (around Howards Anomaly). In one Comstock drill hole (C50), the main carbonate unit contains shallow marine fossils including trilobites, small echinoderm plates, hyolithids, gastropods and inarticulate brachiopods (Jago et al. 1972).  At Comstock the basal carbonates are overlain by other facies of the Lynchford Member including laminated mudstone and volcaniclastic lithic breccia. Details are given in White and McPhie (in prep).|
29474|Lynchford Member|Relationships and boundaries|The character of the lower contact (to older underlying rocks) appears to be conformable in some areas (e.g. Comstock, Anthony Road) where an interfingering contact to the underlying andesite units is observed. In some areas the Lynchford Member is interpreted to rest unconformably on, or in fault contact with older rocks of the Mount Read Volcanics (e.g. Lynchford). At Lynchford the Lynchford Member lies to the west of older Yolande River Sequence rocks (contact not exposed) and overlaps a large exposure of mafic rocks (Lynch Creek Basalt). In other areas the contact is poorly defined due to poor exposure.  The quartz-poor (andesitic to dacitic) crystal-rich volcaniclastic units of the Lynchford Member grade upwards into more felsic (dacitic to rhyolitic) quartz-rich units of the Mount Julia Member at a number of locations (Zig Zag Hill, Comstock, Anthony Road). The contact between these members is gradational and interfingering, and largely based on a very subtle compositional variation up-sequence. The Lynchford Member generally contains a lower proportion of laminated mudstone/sandstone units relative to the Mount Julia Member. At Lynchford, the Tyndall Group sequence is incomplete and the Lynchford Member is unconformably overlain by siliciclastic sandstone, interpreted as Pioneer Beds of the upper Owen Conglomerate (Corbett et al. 1989).|
29474|Lynchford Member|Age reasons|The age is constrained by fossil dating. Fossiliferous carbonate (limestone) units in the Lynchford Member at Comstock contain fauna dated as late Middle to early Late Cambrian age (jago et al. 1972).|

36812|Mathinna Supergroup|Unit history|Mathinna Beds (Banks 1962), Mathinna Group (Powell et al. 1993)|
36812|Mathinna Supergroup|Constituents|Rocks west of the Scottsdale batholith (Australian Map Grid; AUS66; 55G; 550000mE, 5440000mN) include the Tippogoree and Panama Groups. The Tippogoree Group includes the Stony Head Sandstone and Turquoise Bluff Slate, whereas the Panama Group comprises the Bellingham Formation and Sidling sandstone. Rocks east of the Scottsdale batholith remain undifferentiated Mathinna Supergroup.|
36812|Mathinna Supergroup|Geomorphic expression|Typically topographically upstanding where contact metamorphosed. Elsewhere, variably incised and eroded.|
36812|Mathinna Supergroup|Type section locality|None specified.|
36812|Mathinna Supergroup|Extent|All pre-Late Carboniferous sedimentary rocks cropping out in northeastern Tasmania south to the Forestier Peninsula, and north into the Furneaux Group of islands in Bass Strait.|
36812|Mathinna Supergroup|Thickness range|Inferred to be about 7km (Powell & Baillie, 1992).|
36812|Mathinna Supergroup|Lithology|Succession of turbiditic sandstone and mudstone. Sandstone composition varies from quartzose sublitharenite to feldspathic litharenite.|
36812|Mathinna Supergroup|Depositional environment|Upper parts (Panama Group and equivalent rocks east of Scottsdale batholith) deposited as turbidites in basinal setting (Powell et al., 1993). Lower parts (Tippogoree Group) also turbiditic although basin geometry remains unknown.|
36812|Mathinna Supergroup|Fossils|There are only two fossil localities west of the Scottsdale batholith where the stratigraphy has been formally subdivided (Powell et al., 1993). One site in the Turquoise Bluff Slate yielded two poorly preserved graptolites of Early to Middle Ordovician (Bendigonian Be1 to Darriwillian Da3) age (Banks & Smith, 1968; VandenBerg pers comm.). A second site further east and higher in the stratigraphy (Sidling sandstone) contains ?Devonian plant fragments (Banks, 1962; Powell et al., 1993). East of the Scottsdale batholith the stratigraphy remains undifferentiated, with a small number of fossil locations indicating a predominantly Silurian to Early Devonian age for turbidite deposition.|
36812|Mathinna Supergroup|Diastems or hiatuses|Cross-cutting structures and associated fabrics show older Tippogoree Group rocks have been deformed prior to Panama deposition. The contact between the Tippogoree and Panama Groups does not crop out, however, the simpler structural history in younger rocks indicates the likelihood of a hidden unconformity between the Tippogoree and Panama Groups.|
36812|Mathinna Supergroup|Relationships and boundaries|No base is known and the top is an erosional contact at an angular unconformity with the overlying Early Devonian (Emsian) St Marys Porphyrite (Powell et al., 1993).|
36812|Mathinna Supergroup|Age reasons|The Turquoise Bluff Slate contains the oldest fossils, comprising two poorly preserved graptolites of Early to Middle Ordovician (Bendigonian Be1 to Darriwillian Da3) age (Banks & Smith, 1968; VandenBerg pers comm.). Deposition ended before emplacement of the St Marys Porphyrite at 388+/-1Ma (Rb-Sr; Turner et al., 1986).|

29473|Mount Julia Member|Name source|Initial Statement: The Mount Julia Member is the upper member of two members in the Comstock Formation. The Comstock Formation is the lowermost of two formations in the Tyndall Group. The term 'Mount Julia' was chosen as it is the closest geographical location to the type section location (Anthony Road), that has not been already used for stratigraphic naming.                                                                     Mount Julia (AMG Grid Reference 5361600N - 380800E, Selina sheet, Tasmania 1:25 000 series topographical map, Tasmanian Lands Department). Mount Julia is located approximately 2-3 km north of the type section (Anthony Road).|
29473|Mount Julia Member|Unit history|None|
29473|Mount Julia Member|Type section locality|The type section is situated along the Anthony Road between the Tyndall Creek overpass and the Howards Road turnoff. The Mount Julia Member is steeply dipping, facing east and is exposed between 5357300N - 381050E (base) and 5358650N - 381040E (top) (AMG Grid References, Tyndall sheet, Tasmania 1:25 000 series topographical map, Tasmanian Lands Department).|
29473|Mount Julia Member|Extent|The Mount Julia Member occurs from the Mount Lyell district to the Anthony Road, Henty Canal and Moxon Saddle areas. Correlates of the Mount Julia Member occur further north in the Mount Cripps Subgroup (Corbett 1992) in the Cradle Mountain Link Road area and in the Winterbrook area (Pemberton and Vicary 1989). Correlates may also occur further south in the Jukes-Darwin area (Corbett 1992). However, some of these units are more recently interpreted as part of the Eastern quartz-phyric sequence (Corbett et al. 1993).|
29473|Mount Julia Member|Thickness range|The Mount Julie Member ranges in thickness from approximately 150 m (Comstock area) to 750 m (Henty Canal, Cradle Mountain Link Road area). Incomplete thinner sequences are also present in places (e.g. Mount Lyell Mill area, Corbett et al. 1974). The Mount Julia Member is approximately 390 m thick at the type section locality along the Anthony Road.|
29473|Mount Julia Member|Lithology|The Mount Julia Member is quartz-rich (rhyolitic to dacitic) in character and comprises four main facies:  1) crystal-rich volcaniclastic sandstone;  2) massive to normally graded volcaniclastic breccia-sandstone units;  3) welded ignimbrite (including ignimbrite clast volcaniclastic breccia);  4) coherent rhyolite and associated rhyolite breccia. Minor laminated fine sandstone/mudstone units also occur in the Mount Julia Member in places.  Details are given in White and McPhie (in prep).  Crystal-rich volcaniclastic sandstone (CRVS) is the most common facies in the Mount Julia Member and comprises a closed framework of dominantly plagioclase and quartz crystals and crystal fragments (35-70%), with minor titanomagnetite+/-ilmenite+/-hornblende grains in a fine grained altered matrix. Minor additions of pebble to cobble size, angular to rounded lithic fragments (dominantly felsic volcanic clasts) also occur in places. The Mount Julia Member also contains tabular, normally graded volcaniclastic breccia/sandstone units (m's to 10's m thick) that are intercalated with massive CRVS units. They comprise volcaniclastic lithic breccia near the base grading up into massive CRVS, with laminated fine sandstone+/-mudstone at the top and are interpreted as subaqueous mass-flow units. Crystal-rich volcaniclastic facies containing approximately 1-3% titanomagnetite, dominate in this member which gives it a characteristically high magnetic signature relative to other surrounding rocks.|
29473|Mount Julia Member|Relationships and boundaries|The quartz-poor (andesitic to dacitic) crystal-rich volcaniclastic units of the underlying Lynchford Member grade upwards into more felsic (dacitic to rhyolitic) quartz-rich units of the Mount Julia Member at a number of locations (Zig Zag Hill, Comstock, Anthony Road). The contact between thse members is gradational and interfingering, and largely based on a very subtle compositional variation up-sequence. At East Mount Lyell, the Mount Julia Member rests directly on older felsic volcanic units interpreted as part of the Eastern quartz-phyric sequence (Corbett 1992).  In areas of good exposure (e.g. Comstock, Anthony Road, Henty Canal), the upper contact of t6he Comstock Formation (with the overlying Zig Zag Hill Formation) is gradational and conformable. However, at Zig Zag Hill a sharp contact between the welded ignimbrite unit (top of the Mount Julia Member) and the overlying Zig Zag Hill Formation suggests that some erosion occurred prior to deposition of the Zig Zag Hill Formation. This contact is interpreted as a parallel unconformity.|
29473|Mount Julia Member|Age reasons|Marine fossils found in a brown mudstone unit within the 'Mount Julia Member of the Comstock Formation correlates' on the Cradle Mountain Link Road are dated as late Middle Cambrian in age (Lejopyge laevigata II and III to Damesella torosa-Ascionepea janitrix zones) (Pemberton et al. 1991). The age range of these fossils is approximately 530 to 520 Ma (Shergold 1989). The fossiliferous carbonate (limestone) unit in the underlying Lynchford Member of the Comstock Formation at Comstock contains fauna of a similar age (late Middle to early Late Cambrian age: Jago et al. 1972). Recent isotopic U-Pb dating of magmatic zircons from 2 crystal-rich volcaniclastic sandstone samples in the Mount Julia Member gave two relatively young dates of 494.4+/-3.8 Ma and 502.5+/-3.3 Ma (Perkins and Walshe 1993).|

36814|Panama Group|General description|Alternating megasequences of dominantly thin bedded mudstone-siltstone with minor or subordinate sandstone (Yarrow Creek Mudstone, Lone Star Siltstone) and quartz-rich sandstone-dominated turbidites deposited in submarine fan complexes (Retreat Formation, Sideling Sandstone, Scamander Formation).|
36814|Panama Group|Thickness range|Unknown.|08/SEP/10
36814|Panama Group|Thickness range|Estimated from structural sections, in the range 4500 ¿ 6000 m (but top not exposed)|
36814|Panama Group|Lithology|Classical turbidites, comprising upwardly fining mudstone to predominantly fine- to medium-, rarely coarse-grained quartzose sandstone (Powell et al., 1993).|08/SEP/10
36814|Panama Group|Lithology|Thin-bedded mudstone-siltstone with generally minor fine-grained quartz-rich sandstone, or medium- to thick-bedded quartz-rich sandstone (commonly classical Bouma turbidites) with generally minor interbedded shale-mudstone-siltstone.|
36814|Panama Group|Depositional environment|Marine, alternating between background to distal turbidite pelitic sedimentation, and sandy turbidite-dominated deposition in overlapping and coalescing submarine fan complexes.|
36814|Panama Group|Depositional environment|Basinal setting with sediment deposited as turbidites (Powell et al., 1993)|08/SEP/10
36814|Panama Group|Fossils|Vascular plant remains in the Sidling sandstone (Banks, 1962).|08/SEP/10
36814|Panama Group|Fossils|late Silurian (Ludlow) graptolites in Lone Star Siltstone; late Silurian and Early Devonian plant fossils in Sideling Sandstone; Early Devonian plant fossils, graptolites and marine macrofossils in Scamander Formation.|
36814|Panama Group|Relationships and boundaries|The base of the unit is characterised by a change from strongly cleaved and recumbently folded Turquoise Bluff Slate to open upright folded classical turbidites of the Bellingham Formation. The top of the unit has not been defined.|08/SEP/10
36814|Panama Group|Relationships and boundaries|Inferred fault contact with, and inferred unconformable relationship with, Ordovician Turquoise Bluff Slate. Distinguished from high-strain recumbently folded generally non-turbiditic pelitic slate of the Turquoise Bluff Slate by an abrupt change to low-medium strain upright-folded turbidite-dominated facies of the Panama Group. Stratigraphic top not exposed, but is unconformably overlain by extrusive Middle Devonian St Marys Porphyry or intruded by Middle Devonian granitoids.|
36814|Panama Group|Identifying features|Sandy turbidite-bearing megasequence containing Silurian to Early Devonian fossils and lacking Ordovician fossils and high-strain recumbent fold structures.|
36814|Panama Group|Structure and Metamorphism|Generally upright to steeply inclined open to close folds with a tendency to chevron morphology, associated moderately to steeply dipping thrust faults, and moderately developed axial plane cleavages. Regional metamorphic grade is dominantly anchizonal (200-300 degrees C, sub-greenschist facies) (Patison et al., 2001). Contact metamorphism in aureoles around mid-Devonian granitoids reaches hornblende hornfels facies.|
36814|Panama Group|Age reasons|Inferred unconformable relationship with Ordovician Turquoise Bluff Slate. Contains Late Silurian graptolites, and Early Devonian plant, graptolite and marine macrofossils. Unconformably overlain by Middle Devonian extrusive St Marys Porphyry (Rb-Sr age 388 ± 1 Ma, Turner et al., 1986).|
36814|Panama Group|Age reasons|This unit overlies rocks containing poorly preserved graptolites of Early to Middle Ordovician (Bendigonian Be1 to Darriwillian Da3) age (Banks & Smith, 1968; VandenBerg pers comm.). The Sidling sandstone contains vascular plant remains of Devonian age (Banks, 1962).|
36814|Panama Group|Correlations|May occupy all of the Mathinna Supergroup outcrop area east of the currently known extent of the Tippogoree Group; however second-generation regional mapping (at 1:25,000 scale) needs to be completed to be sure of this.|
36814|Panama Group|Alteration and Mineralisation|The Panama Group is host to important orogenic gold mineralisation associated with the last major phase of Devonian deformation.|
36814|Panama Group|Geophysical Expression|Variable. Characterised in some areas on K-Th-U (RGB) radiometric imagery by lack of response in all channels (i.e. dark image) over sandstone-rich units, and strong response in all channels (i.e. bright image) over pelite-rich units. However this is not a general rule, partially due to response modification by contact metamorphism.|
36814|Panama Group|Geochemistry|On standard discrimination diagrams, geochemical signatures show clear indications of a dominantly passive margin sedimentary environment with a quartzose sedimentary provenance.|

24508|Strickland Gorge Formation|Name source|The Strickland Gorge Formation is named after the gorge of the Fad River (EQ547050) where the upper 26m is almost completely exposed.|
24508|Strickland Gorge Formation|Type section locality|The type section is designated at an unnamed creek, between EQ596019 and EQ591019, where both the base and the top of the formation is exposed and the total thickness is about 60m.|
24508|Strickland Gorge Formation|Extent|At present the formation is known from the northern and eastern flanks of Ben Lomond, as far east as Englishtown (EQ440012), as far west as Tower Hill (EQ690024) and as far south as Mistletoe Creek (EP635900) and Mt. Christie (EP578780). It thins and disappears to the east and south, where the Aberfoyle Formation or younger units rest on Mathinna Beds (Calver, ibid).|
24508|Strickland Gorge Formation|Lithology|The conglomerate layers which are courser-grained and thicker in the lower part of the formation, comprise sub rounded to angular, boulder, cobble and pebble sized class of quartzite, sandstone, siltstone, phyllite, mica schist and quartz in a matrix of grey siltstone or poorly sorted brown sandstone.  They are usually thickly, unevenly and poorly bedded, but in places graded bedding is present.  The siltstone is light to dark grey, medium to think bedded, slightly micaceous, sometimes calcareous and contains rare to abundant drop stones, often occurring in clumps.  It usually has irregular, lenticular fracture, and is often bioturbated, particularly in the upper part of the formation.  The boundary with the Aberfoyle Formation is placed at the first appearance of the fissile, thinly bedded, fine-grained quartz sandstone and dark carboneous and micaceous siltstone.|
24508|Strickland Gorge Formation|Fossils|The Strickland Gorge Formation is sparsely to sometimes richly fossiliferous, with a biocoeotic assemblage including brachiopods, bivalves, steroponids and ferestellids.|
24508|Strickland Gorge Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The Strickland George Formation, belonging to the lower glacio-marine part of the Parmeener Super-group in north eastern Tasmania, consists of interbedded siltstone and conglomerate unconformably overlying Mathinna Beds and conformably overlain by the Aberfoyle Formation (A.H. Blissett, 1959, Bull. Geol. Surv. Tasm. 46). The boundary with the Aberfoyle Formation is placed at the first apperance of the fissile, thinly bedded, fine-grained quartz sandstone and dark carboneous and micaceous siltstone.|
24508|Strickland Gorge Formation|Age reasons|Preliminary palynological and palaeontological evidence (Trigonotreta stokesii, Ecrydesma ?cordatum) and the relationship with the Aberfoyle Formation suggests a Tamarian (Permian) age.|

The dykes crop out poorly inland, with subdued geomorphic contrast. Abundant rounded boulders of dolerite float may contrast with angular Mathinna Supergroup float.|
75979|Tebrakunna Dolerite|Type section locality|Defined as those dolerite dykes cropping out between a point ~3 km E of Gardens Lagoon (~41deg 09'S 148 deg 14' E) and Old Chum Dam (~41 deg 04' S 148 deg 03' E), northeast Tasmania. The designated type locality is a large dyke cropping out near the bridge on Tebrakunna Road over the Great Musselroe River (~41 deg 05' 17" S 148 deg 03' 39" E)(McClenaghan M. P. & Williams P. R. 1983).|07/JUN/11
75979|Tebrakunna Dolerite|Description at type locality|At least twenty subparallel, NE- to NNE-trending, +/- vertical dolerite dykes, 1 - 30 m thick, forming a swarm ~ 17 km wide.|
75979|Tebrakunna Dolerite|Extent|The dyke swarm extends NE to the Mt William area and SW at least as far as the Pyengana area. Geophysical evidence suggests a dolerite dyke at Roses Tier is an extension of the swarm.|
75979|Tebrakunna Dolerite|General description|Similar dolerite dykes at South Maria Island, Freycinet Peninsula (Everard 2001), Friendly Beaches, Bicheno, St Helens, Boobyalla and on the Furneaux Islands (extending north to Hogan Island) may be outliers of the swarm; these are more variable in orientation.|
75979|Tebrakunna Dolerite|Lithology|Dark grey, fine- to medium-grained (mean grain size 0.5 - 2 mm), aphyric to sparsely plagioclase-phyric dolerite, with primary plagioclase, augite or titaniferous augite, olivine (?), ilmenite and magnetite.|07/JUN/11
75979|Tebrakunna Dolerite|Relationships and boundaries|The dykes intrude Devonian granite plutons (including Gardens Granodiorite, Pyengana Granodiorite, Poimena Granite, Ansons Bay Granite, Lottah Granite)  and the Mathinna Supergroup. Usually straight to undulose, sharp contacts with chilled margins; rarely irregular diffuse contacts with indications of assimilation or magma mixing with host granite.|
75979|Tebrakunna Dolerite|Identifying features|Distinguished from Jurassic dolerite by form, metamorphism and geochemistry.|
75979|Tebrakunna Dolerite|Structure and Metamorphism|Unfoliated. Primary minerals are usually partly replaced by greenschist facies assemblages (including actinolite, chlorite, sericite, epidote, biotite, titanite, calcite).|
75979|Tebrakunna Dolerite|Age reasons|Early Carboniferous dates of 330 +/- 6 Ma (K/Ar, dyke SW of Ansons Bay) and 334 +/- 7 Ma (40Ar/39Ar plateau, dyke near Mt William area) are considered minimum ages (McClenaghan et al, in prep. D. Phillips analyst).  A Late Devonian maximum age is constrained by the youngest known country rock, the Lottah Granite  (377.8 +/-2.4 Ma; U-Pb SHRIMP on zircon, Black et al. 2005)|
75979|Tebrakunna Dolerite|Alteration and Mineralisation|Minor pyrite sometimes present.|
75979|Tebrakunna Dolerite|Geophysical Expression|Magnetic susceptibility highly variable (0.5 - 40 x 10-3 SI), but usually higher than country rocks. Usually associated with weak to moderate linear anomalies on aeromagnetic images.|
75979|Tebrakunna Dolerite|Geochemistry|Uncontaminated dykes have the composition of tholeiitic to weakly alkali basalt (SiO2 46-52%) with tholeiitic fractionation trends. Other dykes are broadly andesitic (SiO2 52 - 62%), with petrographic evidence for assimilation of host granite.|

24587|Wurawina Supergroup|Name source|Definition:  The term "Wurawina Supergroup" is proposed for a unit in western Tasmania comprising the Denison Group (Late Cambrian and Early Ordovician) below, the Gordon Group and the Eldon Group or Tiger Range Group (Silurian and Early Devonian) above, bounded basally by an unconformity, and overlain with angular unconformity by the Parmeener Supergroup of Late Carboniferous to Triassic age.

29475|Zig Zag Hill Formation|Name source|Initial Statement: Corbett et al. (1974) defined the Tyndall Group in the Comstock/Zig Zag Hill area as comprising 2 formations. The lower formation was named the Comstock Tuff (later referred to as the Comstock Formation) and the upper formation was referred to as the Jukes Formation, from an inferred correlation with a previously defined unit, the Jukes Breccia (Hills 1914) or Jukes Conglomerate (Wade and Solomon 1958, Banks 1962, Campana and King 1963). This correlation with the Jukes Conglomerate was subsequently argued to be inappropriate (Solomon 1979, Corbett 1989) and the term Jukes Formation was no longer used. Recently the unit has been referred to informally as the 'upper Tyndall Group' or 'upper part of the Tyndall Group' (e.g. Corbett 1992). There is clearly a need to give this upper unit an appropriate formal formation name, as it is one of two formations that form the Tyndall Group (a group comprises two or more formations; Staines 1985). The term 'Zig Zag Hill Formation' is proposed.

29475|Zig Zag Hill Formation|Unit history|The Zig Zag Hill Formation is synonymous with the 'Jukes Formation' of Corbett et al. (1974), and is recently referred to as the upper Tyndall Group (Corbett 1992) (as explained above). The Dora Conglomerate (Bradley 1954) is also considered to be a correlate of the Zig Zag Hill Formation.|
29475|Zig Zag Hill Formation|Type section locality|A type area (Mount Lyell area) is proposed, rather than a single type section as the formation is well exposed at a number of locations in the Mount Lyell district. The best exposure of this formation occurs on Zig Zag Hill to the north of Mount Lyell, however the upper contact is not exposed there, being masked by Quaternary glacial deposits. Other good exposures occur approximately 1 km along strike to the southeast around the Lyell-Comstock Mine area, where a number of diamond drill lholes intersect the formation (e.g. C50: 187-477 feet, C59: 4601384 feet).  The Zig Zag Hill Formation is also well exposed approximately 4 km further southeast at a place referred to as "East Mount Lyell".|
29475|Zig Zag Hill Formation|Extent|The formation is exposed in the central part of the Mount Read Volcanics, in western Tasmania from the Mount Lyell district to the Anthony Road/Henty Canal area. Correlates of this unit occur further north in the Mount Cripps Subgroup (Corbett 1992) in the Cradle Mountain Link Road area. Correlates also exist around Mount Selina (McNeill 1987), near Mount Sorell l(Corbett et al. 1993), in the Jukes-Darwin and Mount Huxley area (Corbett et al. 1993) and in the Winterbrook area (Pemberton and Vicary 1989). The Dora Conglomerate (Bradley 1954) is also a correlate of this formation and continues south from Lake Dora to Mount Sedgwick (Corbett and Jackson 1987).|
29475|Zig Zag Hill Formation|Thickness range|The thickness ranges from approximately 40 m (Henty Canal area) to 500 m thick (Cradle Mountain Link Road area). In type area, the Zig Zag Hill Formation is up to 240 m thick at Comstock and approximately 400 m thick in the East Mount Lyell area.|
29475|Zig Zag Hill Formation|Lithology|Massive, normally graded and less commonly inversely graded polymict volcaniclastic conglomerate and sandstone beds (m's to several 10's m thick) containing very uncommon units of laminated fine sandstone/mudstone (up to 50 cm thick). Normally graded units consist of clast-supported boulder/cobble/pebble conglomerate at the base and grade up into pebbly sandstone.  Massive units comprise dominantly matrix-supported pebble/cobble conglomerate. Planar diffuse stratification and low-angle cross-stratification is present in some beds. The clast population in the conglomerate beds is diverse but is dominated by subrounded to well rounded, pebble to boulder size, quartz-feldspar porphyritic volcanic clasts in a quartz-, lithic-rich sandy matrix. Other clast types include intermediate-mafic clasts, sedimentary clasts, granite clasts, undifferentiated altered clasts, cherty clasts and metamorphic basement-derived clasts. Details are given in White and McPhie (in prep).|
29475|Zig Zag Hill Formation|Relationships and boundaries|In most areas analysed, the Zig Zag Hill Formation conformably overlies rocks of the Comstock Formation (lower part of the Tyndall Group). At some locations where the Comstock Formation is missing, the Zig Zag Hill Formation rests unconformably on, or in fault contact with, older Mount Read Volcanic  rocks (e.g. Mount Selina, Mount Huxley, Mount Sedgwick areas).  The upper contact of the Zig Zag Hill Formation is not exposed at Zig Zag Hill, but elsewhere it is both conformably and unconformably overlain by the Owen Conglomerate. At Comstock the Zig Zag Hill Formation is exposed in drill core (Hole C59), and the upper contact is interpreted as an unconformity to the overlying siliciclastic sandstone of the Pioneer Beds (Upper Owen Conglomerate). Approximately 4 km further southeast at a place referred to as "East Mount Lyell" the upper contact of the Zig Zag Hill Formation is gradational and conformable with the overlying Lower Owen Conglomerate.  In the Henty Canal area, the Zig Zag Hill Formation is conformably overlain by the Newton Creek Sandstone (Owen Conglomerate).|
29475|Zig Zag Hill Formation|Age reasons|The age of the Zig Zag Hill Formation is constrained by fossil dating in underlying and overlying units. Fossils have not been identified in the Zig Zag Hill Formation. Marine fossils found in a brown mudstone unit within the 'Comstock Formation correlates' underlying the 'Zig Zag Hill Formation correlates' on the Cradle Mountain Link Road are dated as late Middle Cambrian in age (Lejopyge laevigata II and III to Damesella torosa-Ascionepea janitrix zones) (Pemberton et al. 1991). The limestone unit in the underlying Comstock Formation at Comstock contains fauna of a similar age (late Middle to early Late Cambrian age: Jago et al. 1972). Fossils in the Newton Creek Sandstone (lower to middle Owen Conglomerate, conformably overlying the Zig Zag Hill Formation in the Henty Canal area) are dated as Post-Idamean to Pre-Payntonian B in age (Corbett 1975, Jago 1979, Banks 1982). Therefore the age of the Zig Zag Hill Formation is between Boomerangian and Post-Idamean to Pre-Payntonian B ages (between approximately 530 and 508 Ma; Shergold 1989).  Recent isotopic U-Pb dating of magmatic zircons in two samples from the underlying Comstock Formation gave two relatively young dates of 494.4+/-3.8 Ma and 502.5+/-3.3 Ma (Perkins and Walshe 1993).|
