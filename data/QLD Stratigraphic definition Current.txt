37738|Accident Subgroup|Name source|Accident Creek, passing through latitude 18deg05'S longitude 138deg20'E, is an east-flowing tributary of the Gregory River in northwestern LAWN HILL, Queensland.|11/NOV/10
37738|Accident Subgroup|Unit history|Incorporates all of the South Nicholson Group mapped in Queensland (LAWN HILL and WESTMORELAND), ie the Constance Sandstone, Mullera Formation and Tidna Sandstone (Carter and Zimmerman 1960; Carter et al 1961), in the southeastern quarter of CALVERT HILLS (Ahmad and Wygralak 1989), and in the eastern third of MOUNT DRUMMOND (Smith and Roberts 1963). It also includes all of the Mittiebah Sandstone, Constance Sandstone and Mullera Formation mapped in the western two-thirds of MOUNT DRUMMOND (as revised by Rawlings et al in prep. on the second edition of the geological map). Small areas of Mittiebah Sandstone on northern Ranken, eastern Brunette Downs and southwestern Calvert Hills sheet areas are also included.|11/NOV/10
37738|Accident Subgroup|Constituents|From base to top: Constance Sandstone and its members, Mittiebah Sandstone, Mullera Formation and its members, Tidna Sandstone.|11/NOV/10
37738|Accident Subgroup|Geomorphic expression|Resistant ridge-forming basal part (sandstone-dominated units) and alternating ridge and recessive upper part (siltstone and shale dominated unit with sandstone and ironstone interbeds).|11/NOV/10
37738|Accident Subgroup|Type section locality|A complete section in an area of relatively high dips, and therefore geographically compact, is located south of Elizabeth Creek, from the Constance Range escarpment in the east, westwards for 8 km, to the core of a syncline. It runs from the base of the Constance Sandstone, at Latitude 18deg14'41"S Longitude 138deg23'28"E (224125E 7980770N), southwest for 1.7 km to the top of the Constance Sandstone, at Latitude 18deg14'57"S Longitude 138deg22'37"E (222623E 7980270N), then west for 6.4 km to the youngest beds in the Tidna Sandstone in the centre of the syncline, at Latitude 18deg14'57"S Longitude 138deg18'56" (216123E 7980170N).|11/NOV/10
37738|Accident Subgroup|Extent|Outcrops in the following 1:250 000 sheet areas: throughout MOUNT DRUMMOND, southeastern quarter of CALVERT HILLS, northeastern BRUNETTE DOWNS, northwestern RANKEN (all in the Northern Territory); and southwestern WESTMORELAND and western LAWN HILL (Queensland). Total area of outcrop and known shallow subcrop approaches 16 000 sq km.|11/NOV/10
37738|Accident Subgroup|Thickness range|From a minimum of ~400 m in southeastern MOUNT DRUMMOND, up to 3350 m in the Constance Range region in western LAWN HILL.|11/NOV/10
37738|Accident Subgroup|Lithology|A succession of sandstone, siltstone, shale and minor conglomerate and sedimentary ironstone.|11/NOV/10
37738|Accident Subgroup|Depositional environment|Mainly shallow marine, ranging to deeper water, including storm-dominated shelf, and shoreface environments; possibly minor fluvial.|11/NOV/10
37738|Accident Subgroup|Relationships and boundaries|Disconformably overlies Wild Cow Subgroup in the west and unconformably overlies McNamara and Fickling Groups in the east. In the Bauhinia Dome, it unconformably overlies Caulfield beds. Unconformably overlain by Neoproterozoic Bukalara Sandstone in northwestern MOUNT DRUMMOND, and by the Georgina Basin succession in southern MOUNT DRUMMOND and western LAWN HILL.|11/NOV/10
37738|Accident Subgroup|Age reasons|Isotopic dating is currently unavailable for any part of the South Nicholson Group and its age is therefore internally unconstrained. The maximum age of 1595+/-6 Ma is that of the Lawn Hill Formation at the top of the underlying McNamara Group (Page and Sweet 1998). There are no minimum age constraints imposed by overlying units, apart from the late Neoproterozoic to Phanerozoic Georgina Basin. The interpreted age range of the Accident Subgroup of 1500 to 1400 Ma is based on correlation with the Roper Group of the southern McArthur Basin, which combined, make up the Roper superbasin (Jackson et al 1999, Abbott et al 2001). Ages of 1492±4 and 1493±4 Ma for tuffaceous material from the lower Roper Group (Jackson et al 1999) provides the most reliable estimate for the age of that Group, and hence for the South Nicholson Group, including the Accident Subgroup.|11/NOV/10
37738|Accident Subgroup|Correlations|Middle to upper Roper (Jackson et al 1999) and Renner Groups (Hussey et al 2001).|11/NOV/10
37738|Accident Subgroup|Defn author|Ian Sweet, May 2006|08/FEB/12
37738|Accident Subgroup|Comments|This package of rocks has been accorded subgroup status because a disconformity has been recognised within the South Nicholson Group. The lower and upper parts (both now subgroups) also have distinct facies patterns and depocentres. Although the Mittiebah Sandstone is remote from the main outcrop belt, which is in Queensland and eastern parts of the NT, it is included in the Subgroup on the basis of its firm correlation with the Constance Sandstone, the basal formation of the Subgroup.|11/NOV/10

26290|Adler Hill Basalt|Unit history|Previously included in the Atherton Basalt by Best (1960) and de Keyser (1964).|
26290|Adler Hill Basalt|Type section locality|The eastern edge of Adler Hill is the designated type locality. There vesicular and massive basalt are exposed.|
26290|Adler Hill Basalt|Extent|Adler Hill double volcanic cone, its flanks, and a few basaltic lava flows which flowed down the valley of an unnamed tributary of Emerald Creek, covering about 4 km2.|
26290|Adler Hill Basalt|Lithology|The basalt is dark grey, fine grained and porphyritic with phenocrysts of olivine and subordinate augit. The extent of weathering makes it difficult to accurately determine the number of flows.|
26290|Adler Hill Basalt|Relationships and boundaries|The Adler Hill Basalt is considered to represent some of the volcanic activity in the Atherton Volcanic Province. Basaltic lavas and ejecta were erupted from the composite double cone at Adler Hill and unconformably overlie basement rocks comprising metasediments of the Hodgkinson Formation, and the Mareeba Granite.|
26290|Adler Hill Basalt|Age reasons|Believed to be Pliocene to Pleistocene, based on ages obtained from other volcanoes in the Atherton area.|

29337|Almaden Granodiorite|Name source|The unit is named after Almaden township and railway siding in the southwestern part of CHILLAGOE.|
29337|Almaden Granodiorite|Unit history|Previously mapped as part of the Almaden Granite (Best, 1962;  de Keyser & Wolff, 1964;  Branch, 1966), which was subsequently subdivided by Richards (1981).|
29337|Almaden Granodiorite|Geomorphic expression|The unit forms mainly gently undulating terrain with scattered rounded boulders and bouldery outcrops.  A few bouldery hills are also present.  Areas underlain by the granodiorite have open drainage patterns and show mainly pale to moderate tones on aerial photographs.|
29337|Almaden Granodiorite|Type section locality|The proposed type area is between the township of Almaden (GR 2530 80813) and the Ootann turnoff (GR 2514 80800) on the Burke Developmental Road to the west.  grid references are based on the AGD66 datum.|
29337|Almaden Granodiorite|Description at type locality|The granodiorite forms scattered large rounded boulders and a few bouldery outcrops in this area.|
29337|Almaden Granodiorite|Extent|The granodiorite forms an elongate northwest-trending pluton of about 150 km2, extending from 5 km south of Almaden to the abandoned mining centre of Calcifer.|
29337|Almaden Granodiorite|General description|STRUCTURAL AND METAMORPHISM:  The Almaden Granodiorite was emplaced as an elongate northwesterly trending pluton, at relatively high crustal levels.  The northwesterly trend of the pluton parallels the prevailing trend in the adjacent Chillagoe and Hodgkinson Formations and may have been controlled by the northwesterly trending Palmerville Fault to the west as postulated by de Keyser (1963).  The granodiorite is essentially massive and unmetamorphosed.|07/FEB/11
29337|Almaden Granodiorite|Lithology|Grey, medium to coarse-grained, variably porphyritic hornblende-biotite granodiorite and biotite-hornblende granodiorite are the dominant lithologies.  The unit also includes some hornblende-biotite adamellite and tonalite, and possibly quartz monzodiorite.  Ovoid mafic xenoliths up to 30 cm across are common.   DETAILED LITHOLOGY:  Southeast of Chillagoe (at GR 381 000) granodiorite adjacent to the contact with extensively metasomatised country rocks has a sheeted appearance due to the presence of layers up to 15 cm thick of pale brown garnet-rich calc-silicate rock alternating with layers of relatively little-altered granodiorite.  Zones and vein-like bodies of magnetite-hematite rock were found granodiorite adjacent to the contact in the Calcifer area to the south.  These features may have resulted from 'back veining' of the granodiorite along joints and cracks by hydrothermal solutions involved in the widespread development of endo- and exo-skarns in the region.   ALTERATION:  The Almaden Granodiorite, in contrast to the Ruddygore Granodiorite, is generally unaltered.  However, modified granitoid (endoskarn) is common adjacent to contacts with the predominantly calcareous sediments of the Chillagoe and Mount Garnet Formations, and are particularly well developed in the region between Calcifer and Chillagoe.  The endoskarn zones are irregularly distributed and range in width from tens to hundreds of metres and extend for up to a kilometre.  The altered granitoid rocks tend to be relatively resistant to erosion and commonly form hills.  Endoskarns in this region have been briefly described by Dallwitz (in de Keyser & Wolff, 1964 and Branch, 1966) and examined in more detail by Richards (1981), who subdivided the altered granitoid rocks into two groups,  A and B.  Rocks of Richards' first group (A) commonly have a medium to coarse-grained hypidiomorphic granular texture and span the compositional range from unmodified hornblende-biotite granodiorite to sphene leucogranite. The most common rock type is clinopyroxene (diopside?) ± sphene ± epidote/clinozoisite adamellite hand specimens of which are pale grey to pale green and contain pale green clinopyroxene (diopside?) as the predominant mafic mineral.  Rocks of this group make up most of the endoskarn and occur throughout the alteration zone..Rocks of the second group (B) are essentially quartz-plagioclase-clinopyroxene rocks characterised by relatively low SiO2 and K2O and high CaO, and are found immediately adjacent to contacts with exoskarn rocks, limestone, or xenoliths of metasomatised limestone (Richards, 1981), characterised by highly variable mineralogical and chemical compositions..|07/FEB/11
29337|Almaden Granodiorite|Relationships and boundaries|The granodiorite truncates the Chillagoe and Hodgkinson Formations and also intrudes felsic volcanics (Jamtin Rhyolite) of the Featherbed Volcanic Group.  The contact between the granodiorite and Jamtin Rhyolite is well exposed in the bank of Bustard Creek, (at GR 2476 80947), where it generally appears knife-sharp.  The rhyolite adjacent to the contact is extensively recrystallised and cut by rare thin dykes granodiorite.  The granodiorite shows no significant decrease in grainsize adjacent to the contact.  The grid references are based on the AGD66 datum.    A small unnamed pluton of porphyritic hypersthene-augite-hornblende-biotite tonalite (unit Cgd) forming a prominent hill (at GR 2442 80965) east-northeast of the Harper mine, (Calcifer), is surrounded by and cut by dykes from the Almaden Granodiorite.  Inclusions of apparently similar composition are common in the granodiorite.   The Almaden Granodiorite is inferred to intrude the Ootann Granite and to be cut by the Ruddygore Granodiorite (Richards, 1981).  The shapes of intersecting intrusion boundaries were used to determine the relative ages of these plutons (younger pluton boundary convex into older pluton; White & others, 1977).  The Almaden Granodiorite is also cut by the Lucy, Retchford, Jacks, and Burke Granites, the Hiker Granodiorite, by several small unnamed stocks of and dykes of fine to medium-grained mafic granodiorite or quartz diorite, and by small unnamed stocks and dykes of aplite, aplitic granite, biotite leuco-adamellite, porphyritic microgranite and granophyre (rare).|07/FEB/11
29337|Almaden Granodiorite|Age reasons|The unit is Late Carboniferous.  The Almaden Granodiorite has yielded Rb/Sr ages ranging between 301 and 302 Ma (Richards, 1981).  Richards & others (1966) had previously obtained K/Ar ages of 290 and 300 Ma for the Almaden Granodiorite in a reconnaissance study of the region.|
29337|Almaden Granodiorite|Comments|The Almaden Granodiorite closely resembles the Ruddygore Granodiorite mineralogically and chemically.  It is distinguished by its coarser grainsize, the presence of abundant and relatively large inclusions, the presence of relatively large hornblende laths, and the absence of orthopyroxene (Richards, 1981).   MINERALISATION:  The Almaden Granodiorite hosts the Perseverance lode, a fissure-vein deposit, and one of the largest producers of fluorite in the Chillagoe region.  Gold-bearing vein and fissure-fill lodes occur in the granodiorite near the contact with the Hiker Granodiorite, about 4.5 km east of Fluorspar.  Traces of gold and fluorite have also been found in thin quartz-kaolin lodes which cut the granodiorite near Bungine Creek, about 1.5 km northwest of Fluorspar railway siding.  The widespread metasomatism of the calcareous sediments of the Chillagoe Formation and alteration of the Ruddygore Granodiorite adjacent to the contacts between Calcifer and Chillagoe, with the development of exo- and endo-skarns, is noteworthy.|07/FEB/11

24162|Anning Granite|Name source|Anning Creek which joins the Gilbert River at GR 976 584 (Gilberton 1:100 000 Sheet area).|
24162|Anning Granite|Unit history|Previously mapped as Dumbano Granite (White, 1962).|
24162|Anning Granite|Type section locality|Anning Creek for about 1 km upstream from its junction with the Gilbert River. Pink medium grained equigranular biotite leucogranite crops out, locally containing small discontinuous veins and stringers of aplite and pegmatite.|
24162|Anning Granite|Extent|Crops out in two main areas totaling about 150 km2 in the central eastern part of the Gilberton 1:100 000 Sheet area. The larger area occupies the western two-thirds and southern margin of the Glenmore Batholith extending from around Hanns Table Mountain south to the Anning Creek area and eastwards towards Wire Yard Mountain (GR 157 575). The smaller area occupies the eastern margin of the batholith extending south from about GR 105 755 in a belt  14 km long and 3 to 5 km long; the latter area is poorly exposed and apparently complex containing numerous large roof pendants of Einasleigh Metamorphics. Numerous small bodies of biotite leucogranite are present in the Einasleigh Metamorphics elsewhere in the southern half of the Gilberton 1:100 000 Sheet area; these are likely to be of several different ages and are presently unassigned, although some are possibly related to the Anning Granite.|
24162|Anning Granite|Lithology|The larger area is predominantly cream to pink, medium grained, equigranular leucogranite containing sparse biotite, minor secondary muscovite and rare garnet; hornblende is a local constituent, particularly east of Hanns Table Mountain where the granite contains xenoliths of calc-silicate gneiss. Pegmatite and aplite veins are present but generally do not constitute a major proportion of the unit except near the contacts. The granite generally appears unfoliated, although a very weak foliation is present locally. The small eastern area consists predominantly of white biotite leucogranite; it is otherwise similar except that pegmatite and aplite are probably more abundant.|
24162|Anning Granite|Relationships and boundaries|Intrudes the mid-Proterozoic Sawpit Granodiorite and intruded by Carboniferous (?) Culba Granodiorite and various rhyolite, dacite, andesite and micro-granite dykes which are mostly part of the Bagstowe Ring Dyke Complex. The Anning Granite is in contact with the Dumbano Granite but the relationship is not known because of poor outcrop; the shape of the regional contact as mapped suggests the Dumbano Granite may be younger but little reliance can be put on this as the boundary is difficult to locate; the two granites are possibly closely related in age.|
24162|Anning Granite|Age reasons|Probably late Proterozoic or Devonian. Appears to post-date the second deformation in the area (1470 m.y. - Black et al., 1979); may have been intruded syntectonically with the third deformation (970 m.y.) accounting for the weak foliation. A Devonian age, however, is also possible. At present the only isotopic ages available on the Dumbano Granite, to which the Anning Granite may be related, are Silurian to Devonian (417 to 370 m.y; Black, 1973).|

28185|Answer Slate|Type section locality|South of Limestone Creek, Mount Merlin 1:100 000 sheet area. According to Carter (1959) and Carter & others (1961), it extends for 5.6 km west from latitude 21o23'S, longitude 140o22'E, but the latitute as given is in the Malbon 1:100 000 sheet area, well to the north of Limestone Creek. The proposed revised type section is just south of Limestone Creek, 13 km north of the Answer mine, extending west from GR 339182 (about latitude 23o33'20"S, longitude 140o21'53" ) for 5.3 km. It traverses gently undulating terrain developed on interbedded slate and siltstone, some banded quartz-hematite and cherty rocks, and intrusive metadolerite. It extends from a poorly exposed concordant contact with Staveley Formation in the east to a gradational contact, partly obscured by metadolerite, with Mitakoodi Quartzite to the west.|
28185|Answer Slate|Extent|Crops out in a belt up to 6 km wide extending from 13 km NNW of Kuridala southwards for 72 km to 18 km SSE of the Answer mine, Malbon and Mount Merlin 1:100 000 sheet areas, Duchess 1:250 000 Sheet area.|
28185|Answer Slate|Thickness range|Uncertain because of tight foldings, but maximum maybe more than 1000 m.|
28185|Answer Slate|Lithology|Main rock types are interbedded pale to dark grey (graphitic) or iron-stained slate, siltstone, and phyllite; also present are fine mica schist, thin beds of fine quartzite and feldspathic quartzite, chert, dolomitic and calcareous siltstone, schistose metagreywacke, and ridge-forming quartz-hematite bands. Quartz veins are common throughout.|
28185|Answer Slate|Relationships and boundaries|The formation conformably overlies Mitakoodi Quartzite and Overhang Jaspilite, and may be overlain by Staveley Formation either conformably or unconformably. It is faulted against Agate Downs Siltstone and probably also against Double Crossing Metamorphics (new name), intruded by metadolerite, Gin Creek Granite, and Wimberu Granite, and overlain unconformably by flat-lying Cambrian Mount Birnie Beds and Mesozoic sediments.|
28185|Answer Slate|Identifying features|Formation originally defined by Carter (1959).|
28185|Answer Slate|Age reasons|Proterozoic.|
28185|Answer Slate|Comments|The Answer Slate may be a correlative of the Marimo Slate to the north (Carter et al., 1961- B051). However, Blake et al. and Donchak et al. consider it likely that the formation is overlain unconformably by the Staveley Formation, a probable lateral equivalent of the Marino Slate, and hence regard the Answer Slate as an older unit.|

It consists essentially of subangular to subround quartz grains in a white, argillaceous matrix. Siltstone is typically medium to dark grey, carbonaceous, and very finely micaceous. Mudstone is grey and dark grey-brown, moderately hard, fissile, carbonaceous, and very finely micaceous. Coal is grey to black, brittle and predominately dull. On wireline logs, the Aramac Coal Measures are not a distinctive unit. The base is taken arbitrarily at the bottom of the lowest significant coal seam. The top is evidenced in the gamma-ray logs of many wells by a marked decrease in radioactivity upward.|
526|Aramac Coal Measures|Depositional environment|Deltaic, paludal (marshy).|
526|Aramac Coal Measures|Relationships and boundaries|The Aramac Coal Measures conformably overlie the Jochmus Formation in the Aramac area and generally westward towards the Maneroo Platform and Beryl Ridge. They are unconformably overlain by correlatives of the Late Permian Colinlea Sandstone. The Aramac Coal Measures are probably a facies variant of the upper part of the Jochmus Formation in the Koburra Trough. Palynology indicates that the Aramac Coal Measures are the age correlative of the Reids Dome Beds, the Cattle Creek Formation and the Aldebaran Sandstone of the western Bowen Basin.|
526|Aramac Coal Measures|Age reasons|Early Permian. Spore assemblages obtained have been assigned to Stage 3 of Evans (1969).|

585|Argylla Formation|Name source|Argylla Creek (see Carter et al., 1961).|
585|Argylla Formation|Type section locality|As nominated by Carter et al., 1961, along the old Mount Isa/Cloncurry road for about 3.5 km west of latitude 20o43'30"S, longitude 139o50'20"E. The revision is necessary because the type section includes Ballara Quartzite which has been shown (Derrick et al., 1974) to unconformably overlie pink porphyritic acid volcanics that typify the Argylla Formation and because the lower boundary of the Argylla Formation is in contact with a new formation, the Magna Lynn Metabasalt.|
585|Argylla Formation|Extent|See Carter et al., 1961; this revision refers only to the belt of Argylla Formation which flanks the eastern edge of the basement succession and extends from Duchess in the south for 150 km north to near Kajabbi.|
585|Argylla Formation|Thickness range|From 600 to 3000 m thick.|
585|Argylla Formation|Lithology|The oldest rocks in the revised type section are probably a sequence of tuff, amygdaloidal andesite and intrusive porphyry; these are overlain further east by pink, poorly foliated porphyritic acid volcanics with some possibly tuffaceous bands containing elongate, dark grey inclusions. North of the type section, in the Prospector Sheet area, thin, poorly exposed siltstone and labile fine-grained sandstone are present (Wilson et al., in prep.) intercalated with acid volcanic rocks.|
585|Argylla Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Carter et al., (1961) described the Argylla Formation as overlying Leichhardt Metamorphics, generally conformably. It is now apparent that the Argylla Formation overlies the Magna Lynn Metabasalt, a new formation which was formerly part of the Leichhardt Metamorphics. The relationship appears to be conformable. The upper boundary in the type section has also been revised. Recent mapping has revealed an unconformity with slight angularity between the Argylla Formation and the Ballara Quartzite; the latter was formerly included in the Argylla Formation in the type section. It is proposed, therefore, to restrict the Argylla Formation to the predominantly acid volcanic sequence between the Magna Lynn Metabasalt and the Ballara Quartzite. To the east the Argylla Formation is conformably overlain by the Marraba Volcanics (Carter et al., 1961).|

24167|B Creek Rhyolite|Name source|The name is derived from B Creek, which joins the Langdon River at GR 7461-081549,|
24167|B Creek Rhyolite|Unit history|Branch (1966) did not formally subdivide the 'Croydon Volcanics', although he did recognise a discontinuous basal volcanic 'sheet' of grey, rhyolitic and rhyodacitic rocks probably equivalent to the B Creek Rhyolite, Wonnemarra Rhyolite, and Carron Rhyolite. Mackenzie (1983), informally named and described 'Goat Creek andesite'.|
24167|B Creek Rhyolite|Geomorphic expression|Like the Carron Rhyolite, the B Creek Rhyolite is characterised by gentle to moderate relief, mostly smoothly rounded hills, and sparse vegetation cover. The soil colour is slightly darker than on the Wonnemarra, Carron, or Parrot Camp Rhyolites.|
24167|B Creek Rhyolite|Type section locality|The type section of the unit is 2 km north of the junction of B Creek and Fish Hole Cree; it extends from 7460-068512 (base) to 059506 (top). The section consists of very dark grey to almost black, slightly altered and intensely recrystallised (hornfelsed?) rhyodacitic ignimbrite which grades upwards from generally coarser-grained, moderately crystal-rich, more mafic rocks with scarce, small clasts of basalt or andesite near the base to generally finer-grained, crystal poor, and more felsic rocks at the top. Also near the base are lenses of conglomerate, a few tens of centimetres thick, containing well-rounded cobbles derived from the Langlovale Group (Withnall & Mackenzie, 1983). The section is about 450 m thick, assuming a general dip of 30o, but dip is difficult to estimate because of scarcity and inconsistency of indicators. The unit is underlain here, probably unconformably, by folded, sandy to silty sediments of the Langlovale Group, and overlain by paler-grey, finer-grained, and more crystal-poor rhyolitic ignimbrite and lava of the Carron Rhyolite. A reference section containing some more mafic rocks extends from -079452 (base) to -071452, 3 km northwest of Blackfellow yards.|
24167|B Creek Rhyolite|Extent|In the north of the Croydon region, the B Creek Rhyolite crops out in several separate areas near the Carron River, between Tabletop Creek (7362-362105) in the west and 7462-605155 in the east. Two small exposures are located 5 km northwest of Croydon, near 'Belmore' homestead, and 10 km north-northwest of Croydon (7361-263946); a very small exposure is located near the Gilbert River at 7462-725095. In the east, the unit crops out in two main areas. One is east of Langlo Lake, extending  from 7461-060730 in a 1 km-wide, extensively faulted belt southward to -070622; an outlier about 1.0 by 0.5 km crops out about 1 km southwest of Blackfellow yards, about -087420. Three small exposures are located further south, one near Dingo Creek (7460-057325; about 1.2 by 0.2 km), another, about 3 km long and 250-300 m wide, crossing Snake Creek at -50267, and the third, about 350 m by 200 m, near Sandy Creek at -89124.|
24167|B Creek Rhyolite|Thickness range|In the eastern part of the Croydon region, the B Creek Rhyolite is up to 750-800 m thick, decreasing to about 100-200 m in the southeast. Thickness in the north is difficult to estimate, but is at least 70 m and may be up to 250 or 300 m.|
24167|B Creek Rhyolite|Lithology|The B Creek Rhyolite is made up predominantly of very dark grey, altered and intensely recrystallised, crystal-poor rhyodacitic ignimbrite. Dacitic but otherwise similar ignimbrite is present in lesser amounts, mostly as lenses up to several kilometres long and up to 50 m thick, and in places associated with thinner, less extensive lenses of highly altered andesite. In the north (Carron River area), dacitic rocks are more common, and some are conspicuously 'porphyritic', with feldspar and rounded quartz crystals up to 6 mm. These rocks appear to be slightly different, at least texturally, to those in the east, and further work might result in their being separated as a distinct unit. In the southeast, near Blackfellow yards, the unit contains lenses up to 50 m thick of altered andesite similar to the Goat Creek Andesite.|
24167|B Creek Rhyolite|Relationships and boundaries|The B Creek Rhyolite is partly unconformable on, and partly faulted against Middle Proterozoic Langlovale Group (Withnall & Mackenzie, 1983) and Etheridge Group (Withnall & Mackenzie, 1980) in the east of the region, where it also overlies, conformably or paraconformably, the Wonnemarra Rhyolite. In the north it overlies, with apparent conformity, Goat Creek Andesite, or  Wallabadah Siltstone, or both. It is overlain, apparently conformably, by Carron Rhyolite in the east and north, and by Parrot Camp Rhyolite in the northwest. Permian Bullseye Rhyolite (Mackenzie, 1983) unconformably overlies the unit in the east, near Langlo Lake, and it is also overlain unconformably by Mesozoic and Tertiary to Quaternary sediments. It is intruded by Esmeralda Granite, Chadshunt Granite, Macartneys Granite, Olsens Granite, and Dregger Granite. B Creek Rhyolite is distinguished from underlying and overlying volcanic rocks by its very dark colour, combined with obvious felsic (to intermediate) composition, sparse crystals, notably quartz (commonly rounded), and, commonly, apparent coarse grainsize due to recrystallisation. It is slightly more mafic than the Wonnemarra, Carron, and Parrot Camp Rhyolites.|
24167|B Creek Rhyolite|Age reasons|The B Creek Rhyolite is Middle Proterozoic, as established for the Croydon Volcanic Group as a whole.|

27702|Ballara Quartzite|Identifying features|Revision: A new type section of the Ballara Quartzite is proposed, because the old type section described by Carter, Brooks & Walker (1961) is largely composed of sandstone and conglomerate intercalations in the acid volcanic Argylla Formation. The proposed new type section extends from 0.7 km north of Wee McGregor mine, for 1.1 km to the north-northeast (6856 900877 to 6856 905887), 16 km south of Mary Kathleen. Two units are recognised in the Ballara Quartzite: a lenticular basal unit up to 700 m thick of grit, conglomerate, tuff, arkose, sericitic quartzite and minor basalt, and an upper unit from 1250 to 20 m thick of coarse to medium white to grey quartzite. Neither unit is formally defined. The Ballara Quartzite overlies the Argylla Formation unconformably and is overlain conformably by the Corella Formation. In places the Ballara Quartzite is overlain unconformably by the Deighton Quartzite. Further details are contained in Derrick, Wilson & Hill (1976).|
21218|Belgravia Granodiorite|Name source|The pluton is named after Belgravia Creek, a tributary of Redcap Creek which cuts the eastern part of the pluton.|
21218|Belgravia Granodiorite|Unit history|The unit was previously mapped as Almaden Granite (Best, 1962;  de Keyser & Wolff, 1964;  de Keyser & Lucas, 1968).|
21218|Belgravia Granodiorite|Geomorphic expression|Over much of the area, particularly around the northern and eastern margins the granitic rocks crop out mainly as scattered large rounded boulders and pavements in low undulating country.  The western and central parts of the pluton form boulder-strewn hilly country characterised in a few places by accumulations of numerous large, black, alga-covered boulders.  These latter areas are characterised by very dark tones on aerial photographs; elsewhere the unit shows medium tones.|
21218|Belgravia Granodiorite|Type section locality|The designated type area is ~400 m west of Redcap Creek, around GR 2244 81120.  The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.|
21218|Belgravia Granodiorite|Description at type locality|The granodiorite is relatively well exposed in this area and forms boulder-strewn hills.|
21218|Belgravia Granodiorite|Extent|The pluton forms a roughly circular stock with an area of 6 km2 in northeastern MUNGANA.|
21218|Belgravia Granodiorite|General description|STRUCTURE AND METAMORPHISM::  The Belgravia Granodiorite is essentially massive and unmetamorphosed.  Siliciclastic sediments of the Chillagoe and Hodgkinson Formations adjacent to the contact do not appear extensively hornfelsed.  In contrast, limestones of the Chillagoe Formation exposed on southern and southwestern margins of the pluton have been extensively recrystallised to white, medium to coarse-grained marble, with lenses of magnetite-rich (now extensively oxidised) and tilleyite-bearing skarn locally developed adjacent to the contact.  The calcareous matrix in the polymictic conglomerate exposed at GR 2233 81110 has been converted to a calc-silicate granofels containing abundant quartz, plagioclase and epidote. The grid references are based on the AGD66 datum.MINERALISATION::  No mineral deposits are known to occur within the granodiorite.  There are several shallow workings in a lens of malachite-bearing magnetite-hematite-rich skarn exposed adjacent to the Belgravia Granodiorite at GR 2227 81120.  In the Redcap area calcareous units in the Chillagoe Formation have been extensively metasomatised and converted to ore-bearing skarns adjacent to the granodiorite.  The Redcap lode was the largest;  it more or less follows the Redcap Fault and includes the Redcap, Queenslander and Morrison mines as well as several smaller workings.  Both lead and copper ores were mined.  The zone of ferruginous-siliceous breccia which extends along the Redcap Fault is the surface expression of sulphide-bearing vein skarns, which probably formed at lower temperatures and later than the tilleyite-bearing magmatic skarn exposed in Redcap Creek to the north-northwest (Paved, 1972, 1981).|
21218|Belgravia Granodiorite|Lithology|The Belgravia Granodiorite is typically a grey, medium-grained, porphyritic, biotite-hornblende granodiorite containing plagioclase phenocrysts up to 1 cm long and smaller quartz phenocrysts.  Rounded mafic enclaves up to 15 cm in diameter are common.  Numerous mafic 'inclusions', some up to 30 m long, are present in the granodiorite along its southern margin, adjacent to the tilleyite-bearing magmatic skarn exposed in Redcap Creek.  The irregular, crenulate shapes and, in particular, the abundant net veining of the mafic 'inclusions' by granodiorite, suggests that they formed by the mixing of granodioritic magma with more mafic magma (see Blake & others, 1965).  The mafic magma is represented by a small dyke swarm (of gabbro and diorite?) poorly exposed nearby.  Similar net-veined complexes have been found elsewhere in the Chillagoe region.The granodiorite consists of plagioclase, quartz, K-feldspar, hornblende, biotite, and accessory minerals (mainly opaque oxides, apatite, and zircon).  The mafic 'inclusions' and dykes consist mainly of the same minerals, but are finer grained, have a higher colour index and contain little or no quartz or K-feldspar.  Augite is present in some specimens and hornblende is generally much more abundant than biotite.Minor aplite and aplitic microgranite, as dykes and pods too small to be delineated on the map, have also been included in the formation.|
21218|Belgravia Granodiorite|Relationships and boundaries|The granodiorite intrudes the Chillagoe and Hodgkinson Formations and the Redcap Dacite (volcanics).  It also truncates the Redcap and Walsh Faults and post-dates several other unnamed faults in the Redcap area.  It is cut by numerous dykes and small pods of aplite and aplitic microgranite.Age:  The granodiorite is most probably Late Carboniferous.  It has not been isotopically dated, but 24 samples from 10 plutons in the northern Tate Batholith have yielded Rb/Sr biotite ages ranging between 301 Ma and 302 Ma (Richards, 1981).|

24177|Bellenden Ker Granite|Name source|Bellenden Ker Range, located between the Mulgrave and Russell Rivers (Bartle Frere 1:100 000 sheet area).|
24177|Bellenden Ker Granite|Type section locality|Base of Kearneys Falls (Bartle Frere 1:100 000, GR 704937), in the Goldsborough Valley State Forest Park, where it is a coarse-grained porphyritic biotite granite, with large K-feldspar phenocrysts. A reference locality at the Fishery Falls (Bartle Frere 1:100 000, GR 802989) is designated in sheared coarse-grained porphyritic granite.|
24177|Bellenden Ker Granite|Extent|Forms the elongated granitic massif of the Bellenden Ker Range, including Mount Bartle Frere, Mount Bellenden Ker and Walshs Pyramid; then Malbon Thompson Range east of the Mulgrave River; and Mount Josey east of the Russell River.|
24177|Bellenden Ker Granite|Lithology|Medium to coarse-grained biotite granite, commonly porphyritic. Tourmaline-biotite granites with small amounts of muscovite occur on the northeastern flanks of the Bellenden Ker Range, Walshs Pyramid, and east of Green Hill in the Malbon Thompson Range. Hornblende is present in the Bartle Frere stock (Richards, 1980). Adjacent to the Mulgrave River valley, the granite has been strongly sheared. Late stage microgranite intrudes the coarse-grained granite.|
24177|Bellenden Ker Granite|Relationships and boundaries|The Bellenden Ker Granite has intruded the Babalangee Amphibolite in the Mount Josey area. It also intrudes metasediments of the Hodgkinson Formation, previously termed Barron River Metamorphics, in this area. Locally, contact metamorphism has produced a narrow zone of hornfels. The relationship between the Bellenden Ker Granite and unnamed granites forming the Murray Prior Range to the north is unknown. The granite has been affected by a major shear zone in the Russell-Mulgrave valley.|
24177|Bellenden Ker Granite|Age reasons|The granite was considered to be Early Permian by de Keyser (1964), Richards & others (1966), and Richards (1980). Isotopic dating by Richards & others (1966) indicated an age range of 246 to 233 m.y. (corrected isotopic ages), or latest Permian to Early Triassic. Both dating samples were taken from sheared granites and Richards (1980) considered argon loss to have occurred, thus resetting the isotopic age. The unsheared Wangetti Granite further to the north gives a Late Permian age of 255 m.y. A Late Permian to Early Triassic age is thus suggested, with deformation (shearing) being coeval with or occurring at the conclusion of magma emplacement and solidification.|

27075|Bernecker Creek Formation|Name source|Bernecker Creek, a tributary of Granite Creek which joins the Gilbert River at 815 678 (Gilberton 1:100 000 Sheet araea).|
27075|Bernecker Creek Formation|Type section locality|White (1959) defined the Bernecker Creek Formation as a calcareous sequence underlying the Etheridge Formation and designated Bernecker Creek as the type area; no type section was specified or described. Recent BMR-GSQ mapping has shown that calcareous rocks are not as common in Bernecker Creek as White suggested; most of the rocks there are assigned to the Robertson River Formation. The calcareous rocks present probably represent only the uppermost few hundred metres of the Bernecker Creek Formation exposed in cores of anticlines. Because the structure there is relatively complex and yet poorly known, and leaching of the rocks present difficulties in distinguishing calcareous sediments from the otherwise similar non-calcareous ones, it has not been possible to map out the areas of calcaraeous rocks. As no suitable type section has been found in Bernecker Creek, two reference sections are nominated for the unit.  1. Near the Ortona copper mine along the Percy River between 645 764 (lowermost exposed part of the unit) and 633 788 (top of unit) (Gilberton 1:100 000 sheet area). About 2000 m of calcareous to non-calcareous siltstone and well-bedded fine to medium-grained calcareous quartz sandstone are exposed. The proportion of sandstone in the section ranges from about 5 to 30 percent, and some contains well-developed cross-laminae and ripple laminae. The grade of metamorphism is lower greenschist facies.  2. Along the Percyvale road from its turnoff from the Kidston-Gilberton road at 028 848, north about 3 km to 018 872 (Gilberton 1:100 000 sheet area). The rocks exposed were metamorphosed in the amphibolite facies. At the southern end of the section they consist of well-laminated muscovite-biotite-calcite-plagioclase-K-feldspar-quartz rocks and impure marble. Metamorphic grade increases to the north and the rocks grade into hornblende-diopside gneiss. The complex folding precludes any estimation of thickness of this section.|
27075|Bernecker Creek Formation|Extent|Crops out in the northern half of the Gilberton 1:100 000 sheet area in four main areas, each 3 to 5 km in width: east from the Ortona mine for 11 km; west from the "Iona" turnoff from the Kidston-Gilberton road for about 8 km; east-southeast from the Lower Percy Stock camp for 15 km; and east-northeast from Mount Moran for 15 km; total area is about 200 km2.|
27075|Bernecker Creek Formation|Thickness range|The original thickness of the unit is not known because the base is not exposed; the areas of outcrop where the structure is simple are in cores of anticlines. About 2000 m are exposed in the reference section in the Percy River.|
27075|Bernecker Creek Formation|Lithology|Calcareous siltstone, calcareous quartz sandstone and minor impure argillaceous limestone grading eastwards into calcareous and calc-silicate-bearing schist, granofels and para-amphibolite. The low-grade rocks are generally well bedded and laminated; this is reflected in the well-developed layering of the high-grade metamorphic rocks.|
27075|Bernecker Creek Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The Bernecker Creek Formation conformably underlies the Robertson River Formation. The boundary is marked by the change from predominantly calcareous to non-calcareous siltstone and sandstone in areas of low metamorphic grade, or from predominantly calc-silicate rocks to mica schist at higher grades. The change is locally sharp but is commonly gradational over a few hundred metres. High-grade Bernecker Creek Formation grades into Einasleigh Metamorphics; calc-silicate gneiss becomes increasingly more common in the latter unit towards the boundary, but it is uncertain whether this is a lateral or vertical gradation because of the complex structures. The Bernecker Creek Formation is intruded by metadolerite dykes and sills, the late Proterozoic Mount Hogan granite pluton, and the late Proterozoic or Devonian Robin Hood Granodiorite.|

25784|Big Toby Granite|Name source|Big Toby Creek flows west through the Granite, 40 km west-southwest of Mount Isa, latitude 20o52'40"S, longitude 139o7'30"E (6756 050904)*.    *Australian 1:100 000 map sheet and metric grid reference (Zone 54)|
25784|Big Toby Granite|Geomorphic expression|In the north the granite occurs as boulder-strewn hills and low granite tors. South of Yaringa Creek, outcrop is less continuous, consisting mostly of low bouldery east-trending ridges and groups of boulders in areas of thin sandy soil. Very weathered granite crops out along Little Toby Creek and on the slopes of the Cambrian-topped mesas.|
25784|Big Toby Granite|Type section locality|The type area is near the northern limit of the granite; from a point approximately 6 km north-northwest of Gap Bore on Yaringa Creek, latitude 20o46'45", longitude 139o12'E (6756127011), it extends for 1 km north and east-northeast to include several tors of the granite and part of its contact with the Yaringa Metamorphics. In the type area the margins of the Granite consist of grey fine-grained granodiorite containing abundant dark grey xenoliths of medium-grained gneiss. Aplite and pegmatite veins occur in the marginal granodiorite and the country rock. Further from the contact the Granite is less contaminated and grades into a porphyritic fine to medium-grained granite.|
25784|Big Toby Granite|Extent|The Big Toby Granite crops out discontinuously in a north-south belt less than 10 km wide which extends up to 12 km north and south of Big Toby Creek, in the Mount Isa 1:100 000 sheet area. The total area of outcrop is approximately 22 km2.|
25784|Big Toby Granite|Lithology|South of Yaringa Creek the Big Toby Granite consist mostly of pinkish-grey foliated fine to medium-grained biotite granite containing some microcline phenocrysts and rare basic xenoliths. Towards the east it is more xenolithic and resembles the fine-grained granodiorite of the type area. The accessory minerals are zircon, sphene and opaque oxides. The granite is intruded by veins of quartz, quartz-hematite, aplite, and tourmaline-bearing mica pegmatite.|
25784|Big Toby Granite|Relationships and boundaries|The Big Toby Granite intrudes the Yaringa Metamorphics and in the southeast it intrudes a sequence of basic volcanics that has been tentatively assigned to the Eastern Creek Volcanics. The Granite is faulted against the Mingera Beds and is unconformably overlain by Cambrian sediments. The rocks defined here as Big Toby Granite were mapped as Sybella Granite by Carter et al. (1961). The former Granite closely resembles the southern phase of the Sybella Granite from which it is separated by a fault zone containing a belt of Mingera Beds up to 5 km wide. The relations between the Big Toby Granite and the various phases of the Sybella Granite have not been established by geological mapping.|
25784|Big Toby Granite|Age reasons|Although extensive radiometric dating has been done on the Big Toby Granite and the Sybella Granite this has not entirely resolved their relative ages. The earlier work yielded potassium/argon ages of 1404 m.y. and 1398 m.y. for samples of Big Toby Granite from north and south of Yaringa Creek respectively. These fall within the range (1360 to 1410 m.y.) recorded from samples of Sybella Granite (Richards et al., 1963). Some rubidium/strontium results for the northern sample of Big Toby Granite indicate a total rock age of 1566 m.y.* and a biotite age of 1450 m.y.* (Richards, 1966). These ages are similar to those Richards (1966) presents for the Sybella Granite (sensu stricto). Farquharson and Wilson (1971) combine samples from the Big Toby Granite and the Sybella Granite to locate an isochron at 1620+/-21* m.y. The Sybella microgranite and Mica Creek pegmatite which are phases of the Sybella Granite have been dated at 1520 m.y.* by total rock rubidium/strontium techniques (Farquharson and Richards, 1970). Page (pers. comm., 1974) using total rock rubidium/strontium techniques dates the Big Toby Granite at 1707+/-46 m.y.*, the foliated southern Sybella Granite at 1662+/-26 m.y., the northwestern phase of the Sybella Granite at 1577+/-13 m.y., and the Sybella microgranite at 1537+/-40 m.y. This appears to indicate that the Big Toby Granite is significantly older than all phases of the Sybella Granite, although, a uranium/lead zircon age from the northwestern phase of the Sybella Granite of 1760 to 1860 m.y. has been interpreted by Richards et al., 1966.   *Age recalculated to  decay constant^87Rb = 1.42x10^-11/ yr|
25784|Big Toby Granite|Comments|Discussion: The Big Toby Granite has been distinguished from the Sybella Granite because of its geographic separation from the main mass of the latter Granite, because it intrudes different rocks which Carter et al. (1961) considered to be older than all other rocks in the region, and because rubidium/strontium age determinations indicate that it is older than the oldest phase of the Sybella Granite. Further work is needed to confirm these conclusions. The granite is possibly epizonal (Buddington, 1959) as it has sharp discordant contacts, abundant angular xenoliths and a finer grainsize towards its contacts. The foliation may be post-emplacement phenomenon associated with the regional deformation.|

1621|Bigie Formation|Type section locality|East of Sandy Creek approximately 2.5 km north of Lily Waterhole in the Mount Oxide 1:100 000 sheet area between 400971 (base) and 405980 (top). It comprises 600 m of poorly sorted lithic hematitic sandstone and hematitic pebble conglomerate overlain by a cobble conglomerate with characteristic well rounded quartzite clasts in a hematitic matrix grading into a hematitic sandstone.|
1621|Bigie Formation|Extent|In the Alhambra area of northeastern Mount Oxide 1:100 000 sheet area and southeastern Gregory Downs 1:100 000 sheet area; in a continuous band along the eastern part of the Mount Oxide and the western part of the Myally 1:100 000 sheet areas; in a thin almost continuous belt in the Alsace and Prospector 1:100 000 Sheet areas and as discontinuous outcrops in the Mount Gordon fault zone in the Mammoth Mines 1:100 000 sheet area.|
1621|Bigie Formation|Thickness range|600 m in the holostratotype decreasing to 300-400 m in the Alsace and Prospector 1:100 000 sheet areas. In the Mammoth Mines 1:100 000 sheet area, the unit is thin and only locally present.|
1621|Bigie Formation|Lithology|Coarse grained lithic, hematitic sandstone, commonly with pebbly layers and cobble to boulder conglomerate with well rounded clasts. In the Prospector and Alsace 1:100 000 sheet areas it comprises purple shale, marl, limestone and minor sandstone.|
1621|Bigie Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The unit unconformably overlies the Quilalar Formation and Myally Sub Group. The boundary is broadly concordant but is strongly discordant in the northwestern Mount Oxide 1:100 000 sheet area. The boundary is recognised by the hematitic nature of the sediments. The unit is conformably overlain by Fiery Creek Volcanics or where these are not present, it is overlain unconformably by the Surprise Creek Formation.|
1621|Bigie Formation|Age reasons|Mid Proterozoic (Carpentarian). It is equivalent to the Carters Bore Rhyolite which has been dated at 1678 m.y. (Page, 1978).|

1663|Biloela Formation|Name source|The township of Biloela latitude 24o24'5"S, longitude 151o30'45"E, Monto 1:250 000 sheet area.|
1663|Biloela Formation|Unit history|Kirkegaard & others (1966) in an unpublished report used the name 'Biloela Beds' for the Tertiary sedimentary rocks in the Callide Valley. However, the rocks were described as undifferentiated Tertiary sediments by Kirkegaard & others (1970) and Dear & others (1971). Grimes (1980) used the name Biloela Beds in the same sense as Kirkegaard & others (1966).|
1663|Biloela Formation|Geomorphic expression|The unit is poorly exposed and is mostly flat lying. Towards the southern end of the basin the unit forms hills and ridges in proximity to overlying basalt flows. The duricrusted surface forms scattered mesas in the central and northern parts of the basin.|
1663|Biloela Formation|Type section locality|The holostratotype of the Biloela Formation is defined to be between the depths of 27.2 m and 374 m in stratigraphic borehole GSQ Monto 5. The borehole is located 46 km northwest of Biloela near the eastern shore of Lake Victoria (latitude 24o02'15"S, longitude 150o17'20"E; GR 243392 Banana 1:100 000 sheet area). The holostratotype comprises 335 m of mudstone, siltstone, oil shale and sandstone with minor lignite, carbonaceous mudstone and limestone. The base of the unit is defined as the first occurrence of shale which immediately overlies basalt at 374 m. The top of the unit is defined as mudstone immediately underlying poorly consolidated silty sand at 27.2 m. A sill of basalt 11.7 m thick at 357.3 m has been excluded from the holostratotype.|
1663|Biloela Formation|Extent|The Biloela Formation crops out in the Biloela Basin which is approximately 130 km long and up to 30 km wide, and covers an area of approximately 2500 km2 in the north central part of the Monto 1:250 000 sheet area and the south central part of the Rockhampton 1:250 000 sheet area.|
1663|Biloela Formation|Thickness range|The formation is 335 m thick in the holostratotype and gradually thins towards the southern and northern ends of the Biloela Basin. The formation generally thickens to the west.|
1663|Biloela Formation|Lithology|The unit consists mainly of mudstone, siltstone, oil shale and sandstone with minor lignite, carbonaceous mudstone and limestone. In places there is evidence that the upper part of the formation has been deeply weathered with the formation of ferruginous and silicified duricrusts.|
1663|Biloela Formation|Relationships and boundaries|In the holostratotype the unit overlies unnamed basalt flows conformably and is disconformably overlain by Cainozoic alluvium. Drilling along the axis of the basin to the south of the holostratotype has also intersected unnamed basalt underlying the Biloela Formation. This relationship is not recorded in outcrop where the Biloela Formation unconformably overlies various Palaeozoic rock units of the Gogango Overfolded Zone and the Yarrol Block, and Mesozoic rock units of the Callide Basin and an outlying remnant of the Mulgildie Basin. Towards the southern end of the basin deeply weathered (ferruginised) Biloela Formation is overlain by late Oligocene basalt (K-Ar radiometric age of 25.4 m.y.).|
1663|Biloela Formation|Age reasons|The Biloela Formation is probably of Early Tertiary age. The upper limit to the age of the Biloela Formation is 25.4 million years, a lower limit has not been determined.|

24183|Birds Well Granite|Extent|The granite forms an elongate pluton W of Birds Well, and crops out over an area of about 70 sq km, Duchess 1:100 000 sheet area.|
24183|Birds Well Granite|Lithology|The granite is commonly extensively recrystallised and includes some medium to coarse-grained, locally garnetiferous quartzofeldspathic gneiss and augen gneiss. Biotite is the main mafic mineral. The unit contains scattered mafic xenoliths, inclusions up to about 1 m in diameter of medium-grained gneissic granodiorite or diorite and quartz-feldspar-biotite gneiss that resemble units mapped as part of the Kalkadoon Granite batholith, and, south of Bell White Tank (GR 673421, Duchess 1:100 000 sheet area) small pendants or screens of strongly foliated medium-grained calc-silicate rocks.|
24183|Birds Well Granite|Relationships and boundaries|The granite intrudes Leichhardt Volcanics, Magna Lynn Metabasalt, Argylla Formation, and granodiorite or diorite of the Kalkadoon Granite. It is cut by numerous non-foliated to foliated amphibolitic metadolerite dykes.|

24184|Birimgan Formation|Name source|The name "Birimgan Formation" is derived from the property "Birimgan", 5 km southeast of the locality of the Moorlands Basin.|
24184|Birimgan Formation|Description at type locality|The type section (see Fig. A1) of the Birimgan Formation is the interval 10.37 m to 297.15 m from continuously cored drillhole Rutledge 1 drilled at location - AMG Reference 544204mE 7498697mN Monteagle 8352, 1:100 000 sheet. The core is stored at the core library of the Queensland Department of Mines, Zillmere.  Reference Sections: Surface reference sections of the upper part of the formation occur along small creeks in the northern and southern parts of the basin. In the northern area, the unit is exposed in a southward plunging synformal structure. A creek in the southern part of the area, north of drillhole Clermont 26, contains outcropping units mainly representative of the upper facies.|
24184|Birimgan Formation|Extent|The Birimgan Formation is confined to the limits of the fault-bounded Moorlands Basin, a north-south elongate basin 7 km long by approximately 1 km wide, centred 30 km northwest of Clermont, central Queensland.|
24184|Birimgan Formation|Thickness range|The thickness of the type section of the Birimgan Formation is 287 m, and throughout the basin the thickness of the formation ranges between 180 m and 287 m. The unit is thickest in the northern and southern lobes of the basin.|
24184|Birimgan Formation|Lithology|The Birimgan Formation consists of mostly fine to medium grained, labile to sub-labile sandstone with interbeds of mudstone, siltstone and coal. A few coarse-grained, well-sorted massive, quartzose sandstone beds occur, mainly towards the top. The predominant framework constituent of the sandstone is quartz, with minor metamorphic rock fragments. The quartz fragments are of dominantly igneous and metamorphic origin. The interstitial material consists of clay and quartz cement. Where exposed at the surface, the formation displays pebble beds, cross-bedding and ripple marks, plant fragments and interbedded siltstone. Within the basin the formation contains two major coal bearing intervals with an aggregate thickness ranging from 3 m to 6 m. The upper coal bearing interval is present only in the northern and southern lobes of the basin, whereas the lower interval is present throughout the basin being typically as two seams.|
24184|Birimgan Formation|Depositional environment|The formation is regarded as being predominantly the result of levee progradation within a deltaic interdistributary bay and includes sediments deposited in stream channels, lagoons, swamps, and tidal marshes. The presence of worm and organism burrows is indicative of periodic paralic conditions.|
24184|Birimgan Formation|Fossils|The microflora of the Birimgan Formation has been described by Price (1983, 1984) from core samples which yielded diverse forms of Dulhuntyispora including D. parvitholus and towards the top of the sequence D. stellata indicating the unit spans the upper stage 5a/upper stage 5b boundary. A meagre marine macrofossil fauna near the base of the unit may be equivalent to the Wyndhamia clarkei bed indicating the unit to be of Middle Permian age.|
24184|Birimgan Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The Birimgan Formation unconformably overlies the Anakie Metamorphics and is overlain unconformably by undifferentiated Cainozoic sediments and basalt.|
24184|Birimgan Formation|Identifying features|The main distinguishing characteristics of the Birimgan Formation are the quartz rich sub-rounded rock fragments of its constituent sandstones, the presence of pronounced marine depositional structures and the low rank, high sulphur coal seams.|

The outcrop area of the granite is drained by a branch of Blackeye Creek.|
24188|Blackeye Granite|Unit history|Like all other granites in the eastern part of the Duchess 1:250 000 sheet area, the Blackeye Granite was mapped as Williams Granite by Carter & Opik (1963).|
24188|Blackeye Granite|Type section locality|Central part of outcrop area, at GR 905977, Selwyn 1:100 000 sheet area, where medium to fine-grained leucocratic granitic rocks are exposed along an eastward-draining creek.|

24188|Blackeye Granite|Age reasons|Proterozoic|
24188|Blackeye Granite|Comments|The Blackeye Granite forms a well-defined intrusive body geographically separated from other granitic intrusives. It is probably related to the petrographically similar but more heterogeneous Cowie and Maramungee Granites (new names) to the west and north, respectively. All [these] granites previously mapped as Williams Granite, together with the Wimberu Granite, make up the Williams Batholith (new structural term).|

28307|Boroston Formation|Lithology|Medium to coarse-grained, micaceous, lithofeldspathic sublabile sandstone and mudstone. Local quartzose sandstone and cobble conglomerate. The sandstones are trough cross-bedded.|
28307|Boroston Formation|Fossils|No fossils have been recorded from the unit.|
28307|Boroston Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The Boroston Formation overlies the Teddy Mount Formation with apparent conformity, and is distinguished from it by the abundant, sublabile to quartzose sandstone.  It is conformably overlain by the tuffaceous Harry Creek Formation, and is intruded by the Carboniferous or ?Permian Montgomery Range Igneous Complex.|
28307|Boroston Formation|Age reasons|An Early Carboniferous age, probably Tournaisian, is considered most likely for the unit, because it overlies the Late Devonian to Early Carboniferous Teddy Mount Formation.|

Pale brown to grey siltstone and sandstone 400 m thick are cut by the Mount Isa-Julius dam pipeline road.|
2347|Bortala Formation|Extent|The formation is exposed in a north-trending belt 200 km long and 50 km wide. Mount Isa is near the southern limits of the formation.|
2347|Bortala Formation|Thickness range|80 to 700 m: the formation thins from south to north.|
2347|Bortala Formation|Lithology|Highly feldspathic brown to purple grey sandstone and siltstone, flaggy to blocky, thin-bedded to laminated. Parallel bedding is dominant. Minor quartzose sandstone and grey shale. The formation is valley forming.|
2347|Bortala Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Conformable between the underlying Alsace Quartzite and the overlying Whitworth Quartzite; overlain unconformably by the Mount Isa Group in the Paroo Range, 30 km north of Mount Isa.|
2347|Bortala Formation|Age reasons|Carpentarian; minimum age about 1650 m.y. set by intrusion of the Sybella Granite into Bortala Formation equivalents west of Mount Isa.|
2347|Bortala Formation|Comments|This formation was formerly an undifferentiated part of the Myally Beds (Carter et al., 1961); the very high plagioclase feldspar content (50%) is characteristic of the unit.|

2360|Bottletree Formation|Name source|Named after Bottletree Hummock (GR 532756), in the NW part of the Duchess 1:100 000 sheet area, Duchess 1:250 000 sheet area.|
2360|Bottletree Formation|Unit history|Previously mapped as Leichhardt Metamorphics, Argylla Formation and Mount Guide Quartzite (Carter & Opik, 1963). The sequence extends north into southwestern part of the Mary Kathleen 1:100 000 sheet area where it has been mapped as Argylla Formation by Derrick & others (1977).|
2360|Bottletree Formation|Type section locality|From GR 514542 to GR 518540, Duchess 1:100 000 sheet area. Here the formation is about 400 m thick. The track between Bushy Park and Mount Guide homesteads crosses the formation about 1 to 2 km N of the type section. The lower part of the section, in the E, consists mainly of schistose amygdaloidal and massive metabasalt, and interlayered lenses of quartzite, commonly epidotic. The overlying sequence contains foliated, rhyolitic to dacitic metavolcanics and interlayered greywacke, greywacke conglomerate, arkose and conglomeratic arkose, together with some schistose amphibolite units. Clasts in the conglomeratic metasedimentary rocks are well rounded to angular, up to 1 m (but generally less than 20 cm) across, and consist mainly of felsic metavolcanics, amphibolite, granite and quartzite. The upper part of the unit consists of schistose metabasalt similar to that found in the basal part.|
2360|Bottletree Formation|Extent|The formation forms a N-trending belt about 30 km west of Duchess, and extends S into the Dajarra 1:100 000 sheet area, and SW into the Ardmore 1:100 000 sheet area.|
2360|Bottletree Formation|Thickness range|The thickness of the formation is very variable; a maximum of about 3000 m is attained in the NW of the Duchess 1:100 000 sheet area. The variable thickness may be attributed partly to localised volcanism and partly to deposition on an irregular surface.|
2360|Bottletree Formation|Lithology|The formation consists mainly of sparsely to richly porphyritic, rhyolitic to dacitic lava flows and ash-flow deposits, and interlayered beds of greywacke and greywacke conglomerate and grit. Sheared, schistose, amygdaloidal to massive metabasalt is common at or near the base and top of the formation. Other rock types present include arkose, arkosic grit, bedded tuff or siltstone, ?agglomerate, meta-arenite and quartzite, epidotic quartzite, and laminated para-amphibolite. The formation has been regionally metamorphosed, mainly to greenschist or amphibolite facies.|
2360|Bottletree Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The Bottletree Formation unconformably overlies Kalkadoon Granite and undivided Tewinga Group, and is interpreted to be conformably overlain by the Yappo Mbr. Conglomeratic metasediments similar to those in the Bottletree Formation make up much of the Yappo Member (of Mount Guide Quartzite).|
2360|Bottletree Formation|Age reasons|Provisionally dated by the U-Pb-zircon method at about 1800 m.y. (R.W. Page, BMR, personal communication, 1980).|

2534|Brick Kiln Member|Name source|From attempted brick making on the area of Fireclay Mining Lease 196 (1909-1912) which covered part of the subcrop of the Brick Kiln Member. Location about 302,200E 7,383,000N Gladstone 1:100 000 topographic sheet.|
2534|Brick Kiln Member|Unit history|Part of The Narrows Beds (Kirkegaard et al, 1970) and part of the Rundle Formation (Henstridge and Missen, 1982).|
2534|Brick Kiln Member|Type section locality|123 m of oil shale with minor interbeds of claystone, rare carbonaceous shale and occasional impersistent dolomite; from 143.3 to 266.3 m in drill hole ERD 169 (GR 300,999E, 7,380,998N, Gladstone 1:100 000 topographic sheet). The dark yellowish-brown to olive-brown oil shale contains two major greyish-green claystone beds (from 174.4 to 176.5 m and 248.8 to 252.7 m in type section) and a persistent dark grey carbonaceous shale layer towards the top of the member (from 154.5 to 155.0 m in type section). Minor moderately thick to thick claystone to clayey oil shale beds also occur from 194.2 to 195.0 m, 227.0 to 227.5 m and 244.2 to 245.7 m in type section. A distinctive very thick olive grey, poorly laminated oil shale bed occurs towards the middle of the member (from 205.0 to 208.0 m in type section). Cyclicity of lithologies is a feature with oil shale grading upwards through clayey oil shale to claystone, commonly overlain by carbonaceous material. The unit is calcareous but there is a marked decrease in carbonate (fossil content) towards the top, with an associated increase in the amount of coaly material.|
2534|Brick Kiln Member|Extent|Subcrops in an area of about 55 km2 in The Narrows Graben, NW of Gladstone, Queensland. Sparse, weathered outcrops (particularly adjacent to The Narrows channel and exposed in the mudflats at grid reference 300,750E 7,384,250N) are recorded. The member has been identified from drill hole core.|
2534|Brick Kiln Member|Thickness range|123 m (estimated true thickness 121.1 m corrected for an apparent dip of 9o in ERD 169) in type section. Range of true thickness of the member as intersected in drill holes is 52.5 to 148 m.|
2534|Brick Kiln Member|Lithology|Oil shale, dark yellowish-brown to olive-brown; well laminated to poorly laminated, brecciated and peloidal in part; very thinly to very thickly bedded (up to 3 m); calcareous, clayey and carbonaceous cyclicity. Minor interbeds of greyish-green claystone; rare very dark grey carbonaceous shale and occasional discontinuous yellowish-grey impure dolomite concentrations. Dolomite concentrations tend to thicken and are in greater abundance to the east and northwest in The Narrows Graben. Claystone beds also thicken and contain more silt and sand along the eastern margin. Claystone and brecciated clayey oil shale beds often show bioturbation features. Ostracode tests are abundant with minor gastropods, vertebrate remains (crocodile, turtle), fish elements and coprolites. There are abundant plant remains within the persistent upper carbonaceous layer.|
2534|Brick Kiln Member|Relationships and boundaries|The member is conformable with the underlying Ramsay Crossing Member and is the contact between oil shale and claystone. The upper boundary is conformable with the Humpy Creek Member and is the sharp contact between oil shale and carbonaceous shale. The member is faulted against Devonian to Carboniferous rocks of the Curtis Island Group along the western edge of The Narrows Graben.|

28306|Broken River Group|Extent|A sinuous folded belt up to 6 km wide extending from near 'Pandanus Creek' in the north, extending for about 50 km to 'Dosey' and the Clarke River in the south|
28306|Broken River Group|Thickness range|Up to 2000 m.|
28306|Broken River Group|Lithology|Limestone, mudstone, labile to quartzose sandstone, and polymictic conglomerate.|01/FEB/11
28306|Broken River Group|Fossils|The limestones and mudstone units contain rich shallow marine faunas including corals and stromatoporoids, as well as brachiopods, bivalves, gastropods, nautiloids, crinoids, trilobites, bryozoa, ostracods, fish, and conodonts, and algal and vascular plants.|
28306|Broken River Group|Relationships and boundaries|The Group generally overlies the Shield Creek Formation, which consists of feldspathic arenite, with possible disconformity.  West of the Six Mile Syncline, the Shield Creek Formation is difficult to recognise, and the Broken River Group may lie directly on the Graveyard Creek Group.  Further west it is faulted against the Silurian Dido Tonalite of the Georgetown Province.  In the Dosey area, northwest of Storm Hill, the Broken River Group (Storm Hill Sandstone) unconformably overlies the Judea Formation.  In the southwest, near 'Gregory Springs', the Broken River Group unconformably overlies granitoids and metamorphic rocks of the Georgetown Province.   The Group is overlain by the Bundock Creek Group with slight angular unconformity to disconformity.  The boundary is generally marked by polymictic, pebble to cobble conglomerate overlain by redbeds.|
28306|Broken River Group|Age reasons|Studies of the corals (Hill in White, 1965; Jell, 1967; Jell in Wyatt & Jell, 1967) and conodonts (Telford, 1975; Mawson, 1987; Mawson & others, 1985; Mawson & Talent, in press and unpublished data) indicate that the Group ranges from Emsian to early Frasnian in age.  See also the summary in Withnall & others (1988).|21/JAN/13

24198|Bronco Stromatolith Bed|Name source|The Bed is named after Bronco Waterhole, a waterhole on Brumby Creek located 15 km SSW of Thorntonia Station at latitude 19o37'S, longitude 138o52'E or grid reference 764288 on the Undilla 1:100 000 topographic sheet.|
24198|Bronco Stromatolith Bed|Type section locality|The type locality is situated on the northern side of the toe of a prominent east-west ridge of terraced limestone, grid reference 813368 on the Undilla 1:100 000 topographic sheet. The locality occurs beneath the base of the type section for the Gowers Formation which is situated at a small tree-covered sinkhole located some 300 m due west of the SSW-SW kink in the access track that follows the fence SSW from Gowers Bore.|
24198|Bronco Stromatolith Bed|Extent|The Bed crops out to the south of Thorntonia Station as a prominent limonite-stained horizon on the uppermost terrace of the Thorntonia Limestone. Its southernmost outcrop is found to the S.W. of D-Tree Bore, a distance of 27 kms from Thorntonia Station. West of Thorntonia Station where outcrop is subdued the Bed outcrops discontinuously on rubble strewn slopes.|
24198|Bronco Stromatolith Bed|Thickness range|The Bed forms a laterally persistent horizon of flat and domal laminated stratiform stromatolites that vary from 1-30 cm in thickness|
24198|Bronco Stromatolith Bed|Lithology|At the type locality the Bed forms a 15 cm thick interval of limonite-stained flat and domal laminated stratiform stromatolites. The principal Lithologies are dolostone and limonitic dolostone, with subordinate phosphate coquinas, packstones and phoscrete crusts. Oncolites occur locally.|
24198|Bronco Stromatolith Bed|Relationships and boundaries|The Bronco Stromatolith Bed drapes over an irregular erosion surface developed on phosphatic dolostones and dolostones of the Thorntonia Limestone. The Bed forms the uppermost unit of the Thorntonia Limestone. The upper surface of the Bronco Stromatolith Bed and therefore the Thorntonia Limestone is a disconformity.|

27076|Buffel Formation|Name source|Buffel Hill (grid reference 268906, Cracow 1:100 000 Sheet 8947) 1 km west of Cracow homestead.|
27076|Buffel Formation|Unit history|Wass (1965) defined the Buffel Formation to include the calcareous sequence described above but also included the overlying strata now referred to the Pindari and Brae Formations.  Wass (1965) provided a summary of the synonymy to that date and subsequent workers have accepted the definition of Wass such as Mollan et al. (1972), Dickins and Malone (1973), Whitaker et al. (1974), and Gray and Haywood (1978).|
27076|Buffel Formation|Type section locality|(Holostratotype): As defined by Wass (1965) "Buffel Hill west to 32018441" (GR refers to Mundubbera 1:253 440 military map), the type section is located on Camboon Andesite, over the crest and southwestwards down the western slope (GR 265905) where again it passes into Camboon Andesite on the other limb of the fold. The type section is predominantly limestone (middle limestone member) and Wass estimated the thickness as 640 feet.  (The sequence is not complete and is repeated, no estimate of the true thickness in the section is attempted).|
27076|Buffel Formation|Description at type locality|Reference Section (Hypostratotype): The section from GR 270900 on the southeastern slope to GR 265900 on the southwestern slope includes 45 m of calcareous sandstone, 30 m of limestone, and 55 m of siltstone and is considered to be complete. The upper siltstone member does not occur in the type section.|
27076|Buffel Formation|Extent|In the Cracow homestead area, this unit occurs along the eastern and western limbs of a doubly plunging syncline whose main fold axis is orientated NNE-SSW. Parts of the unit are also exposed on the eastern side of Pindari Hills and south of these Hills towards Cracow Creek. It has previously been recorded over a distance of almost 100 km from south of Cracow homestead to Mt Brest in the north.|
27076|Buffel Formation|Thickness range|This unit is of the order of 130 m thick in the hypostratotype.|
27076|Buffel Formation|Lithology|The lower sandstone member consists of greenish-coloured fine calcareous sandstone. The middle limestone member consists of finely laminated calcilulite and coarse, thick-bedded calcarenite-calcirudite. Lateral facies changes are evident. Abundant bioclastic fragments of brachiopods, bivalves, sponges, bryozoans, and crinoids occur. The calcareous siltstone member includes regularly interbedded siltstones and sandstones which display extensive bioturbation.|
27076|Buffel Formation|Fossils|The fauna awaits detailed description. Eurydesma and Taeniothaerus are prominent in the lower and middle members; the latter unit is also characterized by "Harridonia" mitis Hill. The upper member contains Echinalosia, Anidanthus springsurensis (Booker), Terrakea pollex Hill, and Tomiopsis ovata (Campbell).|
27076|Buffel Formation|Relationships and boundaries|In places the Camboon Andesite is overlain by the lower sandstone member and elsewhere by the middle limestone member. Clearly the contact is unconformable and the Buffel Formation occurs as a valley fill. It is probably conformably overlain by the Pindari Formation.|
27076|Buffel Formation|Age reasons|Asselian to Sakmarian (Early Permian).|
27076|Buffel Formation|Comments|Notes: This redefinition of the Buffel Formation is in accord with the holostratotype which has been shown by recent mapping not to represent the complete sequence of calcareous sediments above the Camboon Andesite nor the units that Wass included in the unit but which can be identified as separate lithological units.|
23435|Bulgeri Formation|Name source|Bulgeri Block of Lyndhurst Holding (Clarke River 4-Mile Cadastral map).|
23435|Bulgeri Formation|Unit history|The unit was previously mapped as part of the Bundock Creek Formation (now Group) by White (1959, 1962, 1965), and the 'lower' Bundock Formation by Wyatt & Jell (1980).  The name was first published by Coote (1986), but not described.  Withnall & others (1988) fully described the unit but did not formally define it.|
23435|Bulgeri Formation|Geomorphic expression|The unit is expressed as a series of low strike ridges, dominated by a high strike ridge, the Red Range, straddling the Broken River in the southwest.  The unit is traversed by a trellised drainage pattern.  Sparse silver-leaf ironbarks are ubiquitous on the drab sandstone and conglomerate which are represented by pale tones on aerial photographs.  Redbeds commonly support quinine bush and have dark reddish to purple tones on aerial photographs.|
23435|Bulgeri Formation|Type section locality|In the Broken River between 7859 578447 (base) and 530460 (top).  The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.|
23435|Bulgeri Formation|Description at type locality|).  The section consists of 3660 m of grey to greenish grey (drab), fine to coarse-grained lithofeldspathic to feldspathic sandstone, greenish grey siltstone, mudstone, fine-grained redbeds (greyish red sandstone, siltstone, and mudstone), and lesser polymictic conglomerate and reworked tuff.  See Withnall & others (1988, figures 50, 52, and 53, and pages 77-85) for more details.|
23435|Bulgeri Formation|Thickness range|The unit is up to 3660 m thick in the main outcrop area in the south between the Clarke River Fault and the Broken River.  However, it thins considerably to the northeast particularly over the Atherton Creek Anticlinorium where it is locally absent and is onlapped by the Turrets Formation over the Broken River Group.  Between 'Pandanus Creek' and the Six-Mile Syncline the formation again thickens to about 1200 m.|
23435|Bulgeri Formation|Lithology|Fine to coarse-grained drab, lithofeldspathic to feldspathic sandstone, polymictic conglomerate, fine-grained redbeds, greenish grey siltstone and mudstone, local green to pink tuff, minor calcirudite and oolitic calcareous sandstone.  The sandstones contain small to large-scale trough and tabular cross-beds, soft-sediment deformation, ripple marks, horizontal planar laminae, parting lineation, and rip-up clasts.  Rare fish remains occur on foresets, and fossil wood and fish remains occur in channel lags.  The redbeds contain desiccation cracks, bioturbation, root casts, rare fish remains, and locally abundant calcareous pedogenic nodules.|
23435|Bulgeri Formation|Fossils|Rare Cyrtospirifer sp. and bivalves have been found near the base in both outcrop and GSQ Clarke River 2 (Lang, 1985, 1986a; Law, 1986); a brachiopod-dominated fauna including Cyrtospirifer occurs in calcareous sandstone in the northwestern part of the formation near the Teddy Mount Fault.  A fauna listed by Hill (in White & others, 1959) and including bivalves, gastropods, brachiopods, pteropods, and tentaculitids came from near the top of the formation.  A brachiopod, bivalve, and ostracode fauna occurs near the top of the unit in the Broken River section.  Scattered lycopod log and stem impressions, mainly Leptophloeum australe, occur throughout the unit.  A carbonised palynoflora recovered from core in GSQ Clarke River 1 included Granulatisporites frustulentus (Lang, 1985, 1986a, b).  Non-marine fish remains have been recovered from the lower part of the formation.|
23435|Bulgeri Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The Bulgeri Formation is the basal unit of the Bundock Creek Group, and overlies the Broken River Group with a slight angular unconformity (a few degrees) to disconformity.  In the type section, the base is marked by a pebble to cobble conglomerate dominated by quartz and quartzite clasts, which sharply overlies pencil-cleaved shales of the Mytton Formation.  The abundant redbeds are characteristic of the Bulgeri Formation and serve to distinguish the unit from the conformably overlying Turrets Formation.  It is faulted against Proterozoic metamorphic rocks and early Palaeozoic granitoids of the Lolworth-Ravenswood and Georgetown Provinces along the Clarke River and Teddy Mount Faults, respectively.  It is intruded by the Carboniferous or ?Permian Montgomery Range Igneous Complex.|
23435|Bulgeri Formation|Age reasons|A Frasnian(?) to Fammenian age is inferred from the fossil evidence and superpositional relationships.|

24202|Bulmung Sandstone Member|Unit history|The rocks of the Bulmung Sandstone Member were previously mapped as Lawn Hill Formation by Carter & others (1961).|
24202|Bulmung Sandstone Member|Type section locality|Holostratotype: The holostratotype of the Bulmung Sandstone Member is part of the hypostratotype of the Lawn Hill Formation. It forms that part of the section which lies between 549061 (base) and 548061 (top) in the Lawn Hill 1:100 000 Sheet area. Approximately 40 m of flaggy to blocky micaceous lithic and conglomeratic sandstone crop out in the type section.|
24202|Bulmung Sandstone Member|Extent|The unit crops out as a single sinuous strike ridge which extends from the Gregory River, 6 km west of Riversleigh homestead to Accident Creek, 20 km east of Bowthorn homestead. It has been mapped in an inlier of Lawn Hill Formation in the headwaters of Stockyard Creek, 75 km northwest of Lawn Hill homestead in the Bowthorn Sheet area.

24202|Bulmung Sandstone Member|Age reasons|Mid Proterozoic (Carpentarian).|
27077|Bundock Creek Group|Name source|Bundock Creek, which joins the Einasleigh River at 7759-263895.  The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.|
27077|Bundock Creek Group|Unit history|Bundock Creek Formation of White (1959, 1962, 1965).  Wyatt & Jell (1980) referred to an informal 'lower' and 'upper' Bundock Creek Formation separated by an unconformity.  Lang (1985, 1986a) determined that no unconformity exists, and Withnall & others (1988) raised the unit to group status.  The Bulgeri Formation corresponds to the lower subunit of Wyatt & Jell, whereas the upper unit is the sequence from Turrets Formation to Harry Creek Formation.|
27077|Bundock Creek Group|Constituents|Harry Creek Formation, Boroston Formation, Teddy Mount Formation (including the Dyraaba Member), 	Turrets Formation, Bulgeri Formation (including the Rockfields Member and Stopem Blockem Conglomerate Member).|02/FEB/11
27077|Bundock Creek Group|Extent|The Group crops out in a roughly rectangular area of about 1000 km2 in the headwaters of the Einasleigh and Broken Rivers.  It extends from the Clarke and Gregory Rivers in the south, 35 km to Teddy Mount in the north, and from 'Pandanus Creek' in the east, 50 km to near 'Oak Valley' in the west.|
27077|Bundock Creek Group|Lithology|Generally labile sandstone, polymictic conglomerate, siltstone, mudstone, tuff, and minor dirty limestone; the Bulgeri Formation is characterised by redbeds.|
27077|Bundock Creek Group|Relationships and boundaries|The Bundock Creek Group overlies the Broken River Group with slight angular unconformity to disconformity, and is faulted against Proterozoic metamorphic rocks and early Palaeozoic granitoids of the Georgetown and Lolworth-Ravenswood Provinces along the Teddy Mount and Clarke River Faults, respectively.  It is intruded by the Carboniferous or ?Permian Montgomery Range Igneous Complex.|
27077|Bundock Creek Group|Age reasons|Late Devonian (Frasnian or Famennian) to Early Carboniferous (Visean?).|
26256|Burges Formation|Name source|Burges 1:100 000 Sheet area.|
26256|Burges Formation|Unit history|The unit was previously mapped as part of the Broken River Formation (now Group) (White, 1959, 1962, 1965).  The name was first published and described by Withnall & others (1988), but was not formally defined.|
26256|Burges Formation|Geomorphic expression|Generally low, undulating, recessive topography.|
26256|Burges Formation|Type section locality|In the Broken River between 7859-611441 (base) and 610442 (base).  The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.   REFERENCE SECTION: In Diggers Creek between 7859-684488 (base) and 670500 (top).  The thickness is unknown because of fold repetition, but is probably of the order of 800 m.  It consists of thin to very thick-bedded, massive to laminated mudstone, thin-bedded, fine-grained arenite, polymictic conglomerate, and limestone lenses (predominantly calcarenite, calcirudite, and lesser calcilutite).|07/FEB/11
26256|Burges Formation|Description at type locality|The section is 127 m thick and consists of polymictic pebble and cobble conglomerate, calcirudite, and calcareous lithic arenite (Withnall & others, 1988, figure 30 and pages 71-72 and 164).  The unit is relatively thin in this section, but it is the only unfolded section known.|
26256|Burges Formation|Extent|The unit crops out mainly to the north of the Broken River, between about 7859-650555 and 611441 in the south to northeast of Jessie Springs at about 740550.  The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.|
26256|Burges Formation|Thickness range|120 to 800 m.|
26256|Burges Formation|Lithology|The Burges Formation is relatively heterogeneous.  Four lithofacies are recognised (Withnall & others, 1988, pages 71-76).  They are (a) polymictic conglomerate-calcirudite-arenite; (b) thinly interbedded mudstone-limestone-arenite; (c) limestone (thin to medium-bedded calcarenite, calcirudite, and lesser calcilutite); and (d) massive mudstone and minor arenite.|
26256|Burges Formation|Fossils|The calcareous mudstones contain plant remains, tabulate and solitary rugose corals, small stromatoporoids, brachiopods, and crinoidal ossicles.  The limestones contain tabulate and rugose corals, stromatoporoids up to 1 m in diameter, brachiopods, crinoids, bryozoa, bivalves, nautiloids, fish, and conodonts.|
26256|Burges Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The Burges Formation is part of the Wando Vale Subgroup of the Broken River Group.  It disconformably(?) overlies the Shield Creek Formation in the north near Jessie Springs, but conformably overlies the Bracteata Mudstone in the Broken River.  In the north it passes laterally into the Jessey Springs Limestone, and also conformably overlies and underlies this unit in places.  South of the Broken River it passes laterally into Bracteata Mudstone, Lomandra Limestone, Storm Hill Sandstone, and Dosey Limestone.  It is conformably overlain by the Papilio Mudstone.  The Burges Formation is interpreted as  slope deposits, whereas the other units are regarded as having been deposited in shelf environments.|
26256|Burges Formation|Age reasons|The age range is Emsian to early Givetian.|

25823|Burstall Granite|Name source|Mount Burstall, 8 km east-southeast of Mary Kathleen, latitude 20o48'20"S, longitude 140o3'20"E (6956 017992).|
25823|Burstall Granite|Geomorphic expression|Rounded elevated bouldery hills and irregular maturely dissected plateaux.|
25823|Burstall Granite|Type section locality|Mount Burstall, 8 km east-southeast of Mary Kathleen. Granite in this area is pink, foliated, coarse-grained, even-grained to porphyritic, and contains aligned xenoliths of porphyritic microgranite and recrystallised calc-silicate rocks, especially in the south. Fluorite is recognisable in some hand specimens.|
25823|Burstall Granite|Extent|The Burstall Granite forms discrete plutons in a north to north-northeast trending belt 8 km wide and 40 km long which extends from Duchess to Mount Philp, and in a similar belt east of Mary Kathleen extending from Mount Burstall to the Mount Godkin Range. The two belts were probably collinear, but have been separated by up to 25 km of dextral displacement along the Fountain Range Fault. The larger intrusions are in the Mount Godkin Range 30 km north-northeast of Mary Kathleen (20 km2), north of Mount Burstall 8 km east of Mary Kathleen (20 km2), south of Fountain Range 32 km south-southwest of Mary Kathleen (22 km2), and 8 km north of Duchess (25 km2). Smaller plutons and aplite and pegmatite veins are common in the country rocks north and south of the main belts, and one small outcrop of granite 21 km west-northwest of Mary Kathleen has also been assigned to the Burstall Granite.|
25823|Burstall Granite|Lithology|The main rock type is leucocratic coarse to medium-grained even-grained to porphyritic slightly foliated granite. Minor tonalite and diorite are found near contacts with the Lunch Creek Gabbro. Potassic and sodic aplite, tourmaline-bearing pegmatite fluorite veins, and rhyolite and microgranite dykes are associated with the granite. The main mafic minerals are biotite and amphibole (?ferrohastingsite) and the accessory minerals are sphene, opaque oxides, zircon, fluorite, allanite and tourmaline. The rhyolite dyke phase 2 to 3 km east and southeast of Mary Kathleen mine contains high anomalous amounts of uranium (Derrick, 1977).|
25823|Burstall Granite|Relationships and boundaries|The Burstall Granite intrudes the Corella Formation, some amphibolitic dolerite masses, and the less altered pyroxenic Lunch Creek Gabbro. It is intruded by unnamed dolerite dykes, and by the undeformed Lakeview Dolerite.|
25823|Burstall Granite|Age reasons|Proterozoic: Green (1975) presents potassium/argon and argon/argon ages in the range 1325 to 1440 m.y., but considers there is evidence of a separate thermal event at about 1400 m.y. Rubidium/strontium isochron studies (Page, pers. Comm., 1974) have indicated ages of 1417+/-45 m.y. and 1595+/- m.y. for the Burstall Granite.|
25823|Burstall Granite|Comments|Discussion: The areas of Burstall Granite were mapped previously as Wonga Granite (Carter et al., 1961) but they have been separated from it because of their less foliated texture, less elongate outcrops, distinct topographic expression, and reasonable geographic separation. The Burstall Granite is a higher level late-tectonic to post-tectonic granite, but the mineralogically similar but more strongly foliated Wonga Granite may be a deeper seated equivalent. The Wonga Granite may have intruded early in the regional metamorphism, and the Burstall Granite later, the latter as a series of small satellitic intrusions marginal to the main mass of Wonga Granite.  The name Burstall Granite has previously been published by Whittle (1960), in the 19th Annual Report of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission 1970-1971, in Plumb & Derrick (1975) and in Derrick (1977). In all these publications the name refers specifically to that mass of Burstall Granite north of Mount Burstall and 8 km east of Mary Kathleen, and which is associated with the uranium mineralisation at Mary Kathleen.|
24204|Bushy Park Gneiss|Name source|The formation is named after the Bushy Park pastoral lease, northeast of Duchess township, Duchess 1:100 000 Sheet area (Duchess 1:250 000 Sheet area).|
24204|Bushy Park Gneiss|Unit history|Previously mapped as Argylla Formation, Corella Formation and Kalkadoon Granite (Carter & Opik, 1963).|
24204|Bushy Park Gneiss|Type section locality|Railway cutting, west of Duchess-Myubee track, 11 km northwest of Duchess township, at GR 750460, Duchess 1:100 000 Sheet area. Here the unit consists mainly of medium to coarse quartzofeldspathic gneiss and foliated to gneissic granite containing pink feldspar megacrysts, and minor finer grained leucocratic biotite granite.|
24204|Bushy Park Gneiss|Extent|The gneiss is confined to a narrow north-trending belt west of Duchess|
24204|Bushy Park Gneiss|Lithology|The main rock types are medium to coarse-grained quartz-feldspar-biotite-hornblende orthogneiss and augen gneiss which locally form large massive to bouldery outcrops. Minor rock types include medium to coarse-grained, slightly foliated to gneissic, porphyritic biotite granite, fine-grained leucocratic gneiss, medium to coarse leucocratic granite, and tourmaline-bearing pegmatite.|
24204|Bushy Park Gneiss|Relationships and boundaries|The gneiss forms a series of intrusive pods and elongate lenses interlayered with the Corella Formation and Magna Lynn Metabasalts.|
24204|Bushy Park Gneiss|Age reasons|Proterozoic|
24204|Bushy Park Gneiss|Comments|The Bushy Park Gneiss may represent intensely deformed, pre or syntectonic stocks and dykes, and may be equivalent to similar units in the Wonga Granite to the north of Duchess (Derrick & others, 1977).|
25687|Candlow Formation|Name source|Candlow Creek, a major tributary of the Langdon River, which it joins at GR 7460-097365 (Esmeralda 1:100 000 Sheet area); also Candlow Dam and Candlow mustering camp, near GR 7560-147315 (North Head 1:000 000).|
25687|Candlow Formation|Unit history|Mapped as (the upper) part of the Etheridge Formation by White (1959, 1962, 1965), who recognised the Stockyard Creek Siltstone Member.|
25687|Candlow Formation|Geomorphic expression|Forms a generally very subdued to flat topography with sparse outcrop, generally where steep-sided gullies cut through to less weathered rock. The White Bull and Stockyard Creek Siltstone Members generally form more prominent ridges, the former characterised by prominently outcropping beds of siliceous siltstone, the latter by steep-sided hills with a dense cover of Acacia shirleyi (lancewood).|
25687|Candlow Formation|Type section locality|About 5 km northeast of White Bull Bore, between GR 7560-236389 (base) and -216377 (top). The track from White Bull to Carnes Dam crosses the section at -224 381. In the type section, lithologies are as follows (from top to bottom): Light to dark grey, locally carbonaceous siltstone and fine lithic sandstone; some siliceous siltstone and quartzose sandstone; minor intraformational breccia...560 m. Black carbonaceous pyritic (or ex-pyritic) siltstone - 170 m (Stockyard Creek Siltstone Member). Grey to white (weathered) siltstone and minor lithic sandstone, commonly purple (ferruginous) towards top; white efflorescence of hydrated Mg sulphates common, due to minor dolomitic component of rocks...680 m. Grey - 200 m. Mainly light to dark grey siltstone, carbonaceous in part; minor siliceous/quartzose siltstone...400 m.|
25687|Candlow Formation|Extent|Exposed in the southwest of Forest Home (west of Pinnacle Creek - about 143o09'E) and the west of North Head (west of about 143o13'E) 1:100 000 Sheet areas, between the Gilbert River (18o15'S) and about 18o50'S in the headwaters of the Langdon River and in the Reedy Creek area. Small inliers exposed north of the Gilbert River near GR 7561-165885.|
25687|Candlow Formation|Thickness range|About 2000 m in the type area; ranges from about 1000 m in the Candlow area (about GR 7560-200310) to about 3500 m in the Pinnacle Creek area (approximately GR 7561-240680).|
25687|Candlow Formation|Lithology|These lithologies are typical of the Formation, but there is considerable variation. In some areas, the uppermost part is predominantly sandy and variably pyritic; in the north, intraformational breccias containing abundant quartz are common. The middle part in places lacks sandstone and/or is strongly pyritic. The lowermost part commonly contains lithic and lithic-quartz sandstones. All rocks particularly finer-grained ones, are variably phyllitic or cleaved, or show incipient cleavage.|
25687|Candlow Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Conformably overlain by the Langdon River Siltstone which consists of characteristic dark grey and maroon banded phyllitic siltstone (without  the common sandy rocks of the Candlow Formation), commonly has a strongly carbonaceous bed at its base, and forms a much more rugged topography. Underlain conformably by Heliman Formation which contains a much higher proportion of prominently outcropping dark grey siliceous siltstone beds. Intruded by Forest Home Granodiorite and Esmeralda Granite. Commonly capped by a Tertiary deep-weathering profile with or without a blanket of ferruginised valley fill, colluvium, or fanglomerate.|
25687|Candlow Formation|Age reasons|Probably mid-Proterozoic: a minimum age of 1570+/-30 m.y. can be inferred from dating in underlying rocks (Black et al., in press) of a deformation-metamorphism event which has affected the Candlow Formation.|
3458|Candover Metamorphics|Name source|Candover Holding, which lies just south of Surprise Creek, in the PROSPECTOR (1:100 000 Sheet area indicated by capitals). |
3458|Candover Metamorphics|Unit history|The Candover Metamorphics were mapped as Argylla Formation and Eastern Creek Volcanics intruded by Ewen Granite by Carter & others (1961). The portion of the unit in PROSPECTOR was mapped as Eastern Creek Volcanics by Wilson & others (1977) but was amended to Leander Quartzite on the Prospector 1:100 000 Geological Series 1st edition map. On the Alsace 1:100 000 Geological Series preliminary map the unit was unnamed, but in the accompanying record (Derrick & Wilson, 1982) and on the Alsace 1:100 000 Geological Series 1st edition map, the informal name Candover beds was introduced. |
3458|Candover Metamorphics|Geomorphic expression|Psa - ridges and low hills of rubbly sandstone outcrop; Pls - poorly outcropping low strike ridges with much sand cover; Pv - low ridges and pavements; Pb - bouldery hills and ridges.|
3458|Candover Metamorphics|Type section locality|No single section adequately represents the four main lithological subunits in the Candover Metamorphics. The holostratotype is defined as a 3.5 km long section along Surprise Creek in southern ALSACE from 6858-605894 in the west to 6858-637888 in the east. The eastern end of the section is about 500 m east of a holding paddock on the north bank of a large waterhole on Surprise Creek. This section contains adequate exposures of three of the lithological subunits and a minor exposure of the fourth lithological subunit. Because of poorly preserved stratigraphy and tight folding, the relative stratigraphic positions of these subunits have not been resolved. The section from west to east comprises: labile quartzite, sheared greywacke, psammitic schist, and micaceous schist (subunit Ps); meta-arkose, pebbly meta-arkose, quartz-magnetite rock, and mica schist (subunit Psa); basic schist (subunit Pb); and at the eastern end of the type section meta-arkose, metamorphosed acid volcanics, and quartz-magnetite rocks (subunit Psa). Pegmatite veins are common throughout the section and dolerite dykes occur in the west. The fourth subunit (Pv) is mapped only north of the holostratotype where a parastratotype is defined from 6858-642927 to 6858-637936. It contains recrystallised porphyritic acid volcanics, rhyolite, mica schist, phyllonite, quartzite, siltstone, and    acid crystal tuff.|
3458|Candover Metamorphics|Extent|A wedge-shaped area mostly north of Surprise Creek in ALSACE. The total area of outcrop is 36 km2, of which approximately 1 km2 is in PROSPECTOR.|
3458|Candover Metamorphics|Thickness range|Unknown; approximate minimum thicknesses of the four mapping subunits are Ps-600 m; Pv-400 m; Psa-500 m; Pb-400 m.|
3458|Candover Metamorphics|Lithology|Subunit Ps: mica schist, psammitic schist, labile quartzite, and tuffaceous greywacke breccia. As mapped, easternmost areas of Ps are largely tuffaceous greywacke breccia, with some acid volcanics; the western area of Ps is of mainly schistose rocks. Metamorphic grade apparently increases from east to west, because mica grain size increases in that direction. In Surprise Creek micaceous quartzite and mica schist are intruded by microgranite, later pegmatite, and metadolerite. Subunit Pv: green-grey fluidal rhyolite, porphyritic acid volcanics, and crystal tuff, schistose in places; some mica schist and phyllonite; minor quartzite and siltstone. Subunit Psa: meta-arkose, conglomerate, quartz-magnetite rock (banded iron formation?), mica schist; minor rhyolitic and dacitic to andesitic tuff, metabasalt, quartzite, greywacke breccia. Some rock types are common with other subunits, but Psa is essentially an arenaceous subunit. Greywacke and arkose conglomerate contains clasts of the BIF. Acid to intermediate volcanics are interlayered with sediments near 6858-630883. Subunit Pb: massive and amygdaloidal metabasalt, intimately veined by granite and pegmatite. This subunit forms extensive outcrops to the north, near 6858-615975; mappable bands of metabasalt within Psa and Ps are also included in Pb.|
3458|Candover Metamorphics|Relationships and boundaries|The Candover Metamorphics are not in contact with older units, hence their basal boundary criteria are not defined. The upper boundary is defined by the unconformity beneath quartzite and conglomerate mapped as Lena Quartzite Member of Eastern Creek Volcanics. The unit is intruded by pegmatite and granite, the larger masses of which are mapped as Ewen Granite, and by dolerite dykes. Most contacts with the Myally Subgroup, Eastern Creek Volcanics, and Fiery Creek Volcanics are faulted. Derrick & Wilson (1982) suggest that Pv is the oldest subunit. Although subunit Ps contains no reliable facing structures, it may be youngest because it is exposed to the west of the generally west-facing Ps.|
3458|Candover Metamorphics|Structure and Metamorphism|Structure and metamorphism: Subunit Ps contains rocks which are strongly foliated, and a fracture cleavage is widely developed. Schistosity is common in the other mapping subunits, and north-northeast plunging folds have been noted in subunit Psa although the subunit generally faces west. Pegmatite, granite, and dolerite which cut the Candover Metamorphics are themselves deformed; some acid veins show folding and boudinage. Greenschist facies metamorphism (up to actinolite/biotite grade) is evident in the metabasalt. Cordierite in one specimen may indicate low amphibolite facies. The feldspathic quartzite from subunit Psa shows development of triple-point grain boundary junctions, typical of a high metamorphic grade.|
3458|Candover Metamorphics|Age reasons|The Candover Metamorphics are intruded by a granite which is mapped as Ewen Granite. In MYALLY the Ewen Granite is dated by U-Pb zircon techniques as 1840+/-50 Ma (Page & others, 1982) and hence the Candover Metamorphics are inferred to be older than this date. Thus the metamorphics may correlate with the Leichhardt Metamorphics, about 1865 Ma old (Page, 1978). Other possibilities, discussed by Derrick & Wilson (1982), consider that the granite which intrudes the metamorphics may be younger than the Ewen Granite and that the volcanic submunit, Pv, may correlate with the Argylla Formation (1777+/-7 Ma, Page, 1978) or volcanics in the basal Leander Quartzite.|
3458|Candover Metamorphics|Comments|Discussion: The Candover Metamorphics are older than Eastern Creek Volcanics, but other relationships are poorly understood. They are most likely correlatives of the Tewinga Group but could be correlatives of the lower Haslingden Group. The sequence of arkose, conglomerate, mica schist, metabasalt, greywacke breccia, and dacitic to andesite tuff resembles similar rocks or slightly lower metamorphic grade in basal Leander Quartzite in KENNEDY GAP (Wilson & others, 1979). If this correlation is accepted, it follows that the Candover Metamorphics may correlate with the older parts of the Mount Guide Quartzite (Derrick & others, 1977) and Bottletree Formation in DUCHESS (Bultitude & others, 1978). Correlation of the Candover Metamorphics with the Leichhardt Metamorphics of the Tewinga Group is based on their relationships to the Ewen Granite. The abundance of metasedimentary rocks distinguishes the Candover Metamorphcis from most areas of Leichhardt Metamorphics but can be explained by facies variation towards the western edge of the volcanic province or by a local depression on the volcanics containing (slightly) younger sediments.|
28102|Carew Greenstone|Lithology|Discordant greenish-black metabasalt, metadolerite; tremolite/actinolite, epidote, chlorite or hornblende amphibolite, with garnet, chlorite, talc, ilmenite, chromite; dark grey medium-grained equigranular hornblende-feldspar amphibolite; discordant greenish grey chlorite-actinolite-sericite-talc rock, relict minerals include hornblende, pyroxene and actinolite|

24212|Carnes Granodiorite|Unit history|Tentatively assigned by Branch (1966) to the Prestwood Micro-granite, although Branch infers that it may be an "outer" of the "Forsayth Batholith". Rossiter (1978) assigned the pluton to the Forest Home Granodiorite.|
24212|Carnes Granodiorite|Geomorphic expression|Moderately subdued topography: low, rolling hills, very open woodland with short grasses, producing a patchy light tone on airphotographs. Contact metamorphic aureole forms a slightly raised 'rim' to the pluton.|
24212|Carnes Granodiorite|Type section locality|In and near a tributary of Black Gin Creek, near the track to the "Knights of Malta" mine and Green Hills outstation (GR 7560-236507).|
24212|Carnes Granodiorite|Extent|In the middle reaches of Black Gin Creek. It is a roughly elliptical pluton with the ends of the long axGR 7560-193510 and -264520; the short axis almost coincides with Black Gin Creek, and the intrusive contacts intersect the creek at GR 7560-211528 and -229499.|
24212|Carnes Granodiorite|Lithology|Medium to medium-coarse-grained biotite granodiorite, containing moderately abundant red-brown biotite with prominent dark haloes around minute zircon inclusions. Orthoclase, and, to a lesser degree, quartz, tending poikilitic; complexly twinned, strongly zoned plagioclase. Trace of late-stage (?) muscovite.|
24212|Carnes Granodiorite|Relationships and boundaries|Intrudes Heliman and Townley Formations, which it has contact metamorphosed to produce an aureole 250 m wide.|
24212|Carnes Granodiorite|Age reasons|Probably mid-Proterozoic, by analogy with the Forest Home Granodiorite, with which it shares many similarities.|

3649|Carney Creek Quartz Diorite|Age reasons|A Devonian age has been assigned to the Carney Creek Quartz Diorite because of its similarity to the Stevenson Quartz Monzodiorite.|
26297|Carron Rhyolite|Name source|The Carron River, in the northwestern part of Gilbert River 1:100 000 Sheet (7461) area.|
26297|Carron Rhyolite|Unit history|White (1965) and Branch (1966) included the Caron Rhyolite in their 'Croydon Volcanics' (undivided); Branch (1966), in a tectonic sketch-map accompanying his geological map of the 'Croydon Cauldron Subsidence Area" showed areas of 'rhyodacitic flows' which correspond in part with some of the Carron Rhyolite, particularly in the east. The unit was informally named 'Carron rhyolite' and described by Mackenzie (1983).|
26297|Carron Rhyolite|Geomorphic expression|The Carron Rhyolite is distinguished by gentle, rounded to moderately steep  and rugged hills with a very sparse, low tree cover and pale-toned grasses. A distinctive, closely-spaced rectilinear drainage pattern is developed in several areas. Areas of altered rock generally form relatively higher, more rugged terrain with a denser tree cover, dominated by Acacia shirleyii ("lancewood").|
26297|Carron Rhyolite|Type section locality|The type section is between GR 7361-275931 (base) and -293941 (top) near Golden Gate Creek, 8 km northwest of Croydon, and consists of about 500 m of medium to dark grey, fine-grained, crystal-poor rhyolitic ignimbrite with fine, streaked-out, eutaxitic foliation; it is sericitised near the base. The base is a concordant, possibly paraconformable contact with the Nancy Lee Sandstone Member (Parrot Camp Rhyolite), and the top is a conformable contact with greenish-grey, medium-grained, moderately crystal-rich rhyolitic ignimbrite (Idalia Rhyolite).|
26297|Carron Rhyolite|Description at type locality|(1) along a track to 'Homeward Bound' and 'Waterfall' mines, between GR 7361-334918 on the Croydon-'Tabletop' road (base not exposed; faulted against Idalia Rhyolite) and -349939 (top - conformably overlain by Idalia Rhyolite), where a 400-metre section of typical outcrop with well-developed eutaxitic foliation can ben seen; (2) between GR 7460-049319 and -010349 along the southern side of Dingo Creek, where excellent exposures with contorted eutaxitic foliation and flow-banding can be seen in a 700+ m-thick section which overlies medium-dark grey, medium-grained, crystal-rich rhyolitic ignimbrite (Wonnemarra Rhyolite) and is conformably overlain by Idalia Rhyolite.|
26297|Carron Rhyolite|Extent|The unit crops out in a discontinuous belt, about 7 to 10 km wide, extending from 10 km northwest of Croydon township to the Gilbert River, then discontinuously along the southwestern side of the river to near "Lake Carlo" homestead (GR 7461-893960). It also crops out discontinuously in a 5 km wide belt along the eastern side of the Gregory Range (between GR 7461-000820 and 7460-055180), and also in a 670 km2 area straddling the Yappar River, about 12 km west of 'Glenora' homestead (around 7460-940980).|
26297|Carron Rhyolite|Thickness range|The thickness probably averages 500 m, possibly up to 700 m in places; it is commonly difficult to estimate because of deformed foliation and/or complex structure.|
26297|Carron Rhyolite|Lithology|The Carron Rhyolite consists mostly of dark grey to bluish-grey, densely welded, crystal-poor rhyolitic ignimbrite, which commonly shows fine, streaked out, eutaxitic foliation resembling flow lamination; in places, this foliation is deformed to resemble soft-sediment slump folds (due to plastic flow of hot ignimbrite after compaction and welding). There is also some flow-laminated to banded rhyolite, notably in southeast Esmeralda 1:100 000 Sheet, and rare rhyolitic fine ash tuff and dacitic(?) ignimbrite. The unit typically contains sparsely scattered crystals of quartz, K-feldspar, and plagioclase about 1 mm across, scarce biotite (mostly chloritised), and very rare garnet; it also typically contains sparsely scattered graphite pellets up to 5-7 mm long, as well as disseminated graphite flakes. The rocks are moderately to intensely altered (mostly to sericite) over extensive areas, particularly in the north of Croydon and Gilbert River 1:100 000 Sheets, where they are generally pale green.|
26297|Carron Rhyolite|Relationships and boundaries|The Carron Rhyolite overlies, apparently conformably, B Creek Rhyolite, and, in parts of the north of Croydon 1:100 000 Sheet area, Parrot Camp Rhyolite; it overlies, with apparent unconformity, Malacura Sandstone in a small area near GR 7461-810020. It is overlain, with apparent conformity, by Idalia Rhyolite, and is intruded by Esmeralda, Mooremount, Chadshunt, Olsens, and Nonda Granites, and by several small, unnamed granitic stocks. It is unconformably overlain by Permian volcanic rocks and sediments (Bullseye Rhyolite), and by Mesozoic and younger sediments.|
26297|Carron Rhyolite|Age reasons|The Carron and Idalia Rhyolites were dated as 1400 +/- 75 m.y., i.e. Middle Proterozoic, by Richards & others (1966) and Black (1973).|
29310|Carrs Granite|Name source|The unit is named after Carrs Creek which drains part of the southeastern outcrop area.|
29310|Carrs Granite|Unit history|Previously mapped as Herbert River Granite (Best, 1962;  de Keyser & Wolff, 1964).|
29310|Carrs Granite|Geomorphic expression|The adamellite forms gently undulating to hilly terrain with scattered pavements, boulders and bouldery outcrops.  The country underlain by the unit has an open drainage pattern and is characterised by medium tones on aerial photographs.|
29310|Carrs Granite|Type section locality|The designated type area is on the southern side of the Chillagoe-Bolwarra road, about 18 km southwest of Chillagoe, at GR 2223 80905.  The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.|
29310|Carrs Granite|Description at type locality|There the adamellite forms large rounded boulders and extensive pavements.|
29310|Carrs Granite|Extent|The unit forms an elongate, northwesterly-trending pluton ~15 to 20 km southwest of Chillagoe.  It crops out over an area of ~75 km2 in MUNGANA, and extends into CHILLAGOE (~25 km2).|
29310|Carrs Granite|General description|STRUCTURE AND METAMORPHISM::  The unit forms massive, non-foliated outcrops.  It is surrounded by a narrow contact metamorphic aureole in which hornfelses containing cordierite porphyroblasts up to 3 cm across are locally developed in schistose metasediments of the McDevitt Metamorphics adjacent to the contact.MINERALISATION:: No ore deposits of economic potential have been found in the adamellite.|
29310|Carrs Granite|Lithology|Fine to medium-grained, grey to pale pink (altered), slightly porphyritic hornblende-biotite adamellite (Fig. ? , Table?   ) is the predominant rock type.  Minor biotite leucogranite and aplite are present locally.  The adamellite does not show a marked decrease in grainsize adjacent to contacts with the country rocks, in most places.The Carrs Granite consists of quartz, plagioclase, K-feldspar, biotite, hornblende, and accessory and secondary minerals.  Rounded mafic enclaves up to 5 cm across are fairly common.  Adamellite exposed at GR ??        contains inclusions up to ~1 m across of more mafic granodiorite and diorite.  The adamellite also contains small secondary iron oxide-stained patches which probably indicate the former presence of pyrite.Quartz forms irregular, anhedral grains (up to 1 mm long), generally characterised by undulose extinction.  The grains commonly form rounded or ovoid aggregates resembling phenocrysts, up to 1 cm across.K-feldspar occurs as subhedral to anhedral grains up to 2 mm across and as sparse scattered phenocrysts up to about 1 cm long.  It is commonly microperthitic; rare grains also show cross-hatched twinning typical of microcline.  Small inclusions of quartz, biotite, and plagioclase are present in many grains.  Granophyric intergrowths characterise some specimens.Plagioclase forms white to pale pink (altered), complexly zoned, subhedral laths up to about 6 mm long.  Biotite forms euhedral flakes (up to ~2 mm x 1 mm) pleochroic from dark red-brown to straw yellow, and containing small inclusions of opaque oxide and zircon.  In some specimens hornblende is present in roughly equal proportions to biotite;  in others it is scarce, probably at least partly the result of preferential replacement by chlorite.  Hornblende tends to form euhedral to subhedral grains up to about 1 mm long and pleochroic from bluish green to pale yellowish green.  Accessory minerals are mainly opaque oxide(s) as scattered euhedral to subhedral grains up to 0.3 mm across), zircon (relatively common), zoned allanite, and sphene.|07/MAY/08
29310|Carrs Granite|Relationships and boundaries|The Carrs Granite intrudes the Dargalong and McDevitt Metamorphics, Nundah Granodiorite, and the Ootann(?) and Quaker Granites.  It is cut by rare dykes of strongly porphyritic, relatively mafic microgranite (sensu lato) and by several pods and dykes of pale pink, fine-grained biotite leucogranite, which tend to form hills and ridges - most of these bodies have not been delineated on the map.  The leucogranite contains small miarolitic cavities (e.g., at GR 2220 80902).  The dykes of strongly porphyritic microgranite have northwesterly and possibly northeasterly trends and extend up to ~14 km.  Phenocrysts consist mainly of white to dark pink feldspar (up to ~3 cm), together with subordinate quartz (up to ~1 cm).|
29310|Carrs Granite|Age reasons|The adamellite has not been isotopically dated, but it is most probably Late Carboniferous - all units of the northern Tate Batholith isotopically dated have yielded ages of ~300 Ma.|
29310|Carrs Granite|Comments|The Carrs Granite is similar mineralogically and chemically to Late Carboniferous granites of the Ootann Supersuite mapped farther east (in CHILLAGOE).  The pronounced northwesterly-elongation of the pluton, more or less parallel to the Palmerville Fault, is noteworthy.  It probably indicates that emplacement of the pluton was influenced by regional structures related to the Palmerville Fault.|

The type section contains approximately 200 m of pink, rather weathered sheared porphyritic rhyolite. |
3701|Carters Bore Rhyolite|Extent|Mount Isa and Kennedy Gap 1:100 000 Sheet area; as discontinuous areas along the May Downs fault zone, south for 30 km from a point 25 km north-northwest of Carters Bore, in a narrow area from near the May Downs gold mine to the Barkly Highway between 8 and 10 km west of 29-Mile Bore and then southeast to about 4 km south of 29-Mile  Bore, and in several isolated outcrops to the north of the Highway (near 085485, fro 5 km north of 188485, and for 8 km northeast of 117770).|
3701|Carters Bore Rhyolite|Thickness range|At least 200 m; the top of the unit is probably not exposed.|
3701|Carters Bore Rhyolite|Lithology|Quartz-microcline porphyry, rhyolite tuff, minor agglomerate, muscovite schist containing relict quartz phenocrysts, and flow-banded rhyolite. In some sections the phenocrysts tend to be smaller and the colour of the rhyolite paler towards the top of the unit. Minor flows of altered basalt ar present in the north of the Kennedy Gap 1:100 000 Sheet area. |
3701|Carters Bore Rhyolite|Relationships and boundaries|The Carters Bore Rhyolite overlies the Judenan Beds possibly slightly unconformably. It is overlain unconformably by the Gunpowder Creek Formation and an equivalent unit, the Mingera Beds. The Rhyolite contrasts sharply with the underlying and overlying arenaceous rocks.|
3701|Carters Bore Rhyolite|Age reasons|Carpentarian (Middle Proterozoic). Page (pers. comm., 1976) obtained a Rb-Sr model age of 1555+/-20 m.y. and a U-Pb zircon age of 1678+/-1 m.y. for this unit. He atatributed the discrepancy in ages to a disturbance of the Rb-Sr total rock system.|
3701|Carters Bore Rhyolite|Comments|The quartz grains in the Carters Bore Rhyolite typically have a bipyramidal habit similar to the quartz in the northwestern Sybella Granite. The groundmass of the Rhyolite is finer grained and it is possible that the Rhyolite is an extrusive equivalent of this high-level intrusive phase of the Sybellla Granite. Acid volcanics recorded from the Seymour River area 170 km north-northwest of Mount Isa may be equivalent to the Carters Bore Rhyolite.|

The middle limestone is 230 m thick and consists of bedded calcarenite and calcareous shale with a few large lenses of non-bedded coarse bioclastic calcarenite and calcirudite, biostromal limestone and incipient bioherms.  About 45 m of fine to coarse-grained lithic sandstone with occasional shale and conglomerate interbeds overlie the middle limestone.The upper limestone consists of 152 m of bedded calcarenite, biomicrite, calcareous mudstone, thick bioclastic calcarenite, calcilutite, and interbeds of lithic sandstone.|
27078|Chinaman Creek Limestone|Extent|A narrow, linear belt up to 1 km wide and 10.5 km long, west of 'Pandanus Creek' and trending north from the Tank Creek Fault to the hinge of the Six Mile Syncline.|
27078|Chinaman Creek Limestone|Thickness range|Up to 650 m.|
27078|Chinaman Creek Limestone|Lithology|Mainly thin to very thick, massive beds of bioclastic calcarenite and calcirudite, with thinner biomicrite and sporadic interbeds of calcareous mudstone, fine to coarse-grained lithic to quartzose sandstone, and pebble conglomerate.  Bioherms 2 km long and 30 m thick occur in the lower part of the sequence|
27078|Chinaman Creek Limestone|Fossils|The limestones contain rich shallow marine faunas including corals and stromatoporoids, and lesser brachiopods, bivalves, gastropods, crinoids, trilobites, bryozoa, ostracods, and conodonts and algae.|
27078|Chinaman Creek Limestone|Relationships and boundaries|The unit is part of the Wando Vale Subgroup of the Broken River Group.  It conformably overlies the Tank Creek sandstone north of 'Pandanus Creek', whereas to the south it directly overlies the Shield Creek Formation, probably disconformably.  At its northern end it is abruptly abutted by undifferentiated sandstone and mudstone of the Wando Vale Subgroup.|
27078|Chinaman Creek Limestone|Age reasons|Studies of the corals (Jell, 1967; Jell in Wyatt & Jell, 1967) and conodonts (Telford, 1975; Mawson & Talent, 1987) indicate that the unit ranges from middle Emsian to middle Givetian in age.  Three rugose coral faunas were recognised.  See the summary in Withnall & others (1988).|

25711|Clarke River Group|Name source|The Clarke River, a tributary of the Burdekin River.|
25711|Clarke River Group|Unit history|Clarke River Formation (White, 1959).|
25711|Clarke River Group|Constituents|The constituent formations of the Clarke River Group are (in ascending stratigraphic order) the Venetia Formation and the Lyall Formation. The Lyall Formation contains the Furry Hoop Member and Meath Rhyolite Member.|
25711|Clarke River Group|Extent|The exact limits of the Clarke River Basin have not been established, but erosional remnants assigned to the sequence occur over an area of about 400 km2. The main outcrop area is a belt up to 25 km wide and 60 km long adjacent to the Clarke River 40 km south-southeast of Greenvale. Outliers occur to the north in the Blue Range, and in the Gray Creek area approximately 15 km south of Greenvale.|
25711|Clarke River Group|Thickness range|The thickness of the group is difficult to determine because of irregular open folds and faulting, and because of the erosion of the upper portion of the Lyall Formation. A composite of type sections from constituent formations approximates 1200 m in thickness. This is only a rough estimate because the units within the Clarke River Group range considerably in thickness across the basin.|
25711|Clarke River Group|Lithology|Poorly sorted, gritty to pebbly lithofeldspathic sandstones, volcanolithic sandstones, micaceous siltstones and tuffs. The sedimentary rocks are locally calcareous and may contain carbonaceous fragments and silicified logs.|
25711|Clarke River Group|Relationships and boundaries|The Clarke River Group unconformably overlies (and is locally faulted against) deformed, mainly flyschoid, sedimentary rocks of the Broken River Embayment. These include the Wairuna, Pelican Range, Perry Creek, Kangaroo Hills, and Graveyard Creek Formations. To the south the Clarke River Group is unconformably overlain by Cainozoic basalt, and to the north it is mantled by Tertiary laterite. In the east the group abutts the Oweenee Granite and intermediate igneous rocks. The relationship here is uncertain. Small quartz porphyry bosses and stocks intrude the group.|
25711|Clarke River Group|Identifying features|The sedimentary rocks in the Clarke River Basin were defined by White (1959) as the Clarke River Formation and subsequently described by Wyatt & others (1960), White (1962, 1965), Wyatt & others (1970). Wyatt & Jell (1980) and Jell & Playford (in press) reviewed the geology of the basin based partly on work carried out by AFMECO during a uranium exploration program in the 1970's (Fouques, 1975; Coles, 1979; Marlow, 1977; Dalgarno, 1977; Mouthier & Rippert, 1980). Fieldwork by GSQ officers in 1984 recognised two distinct lithological units within the Clarke River Formation. In this revised definition the name of the unit is changed to the Clarke River Group, which is divided into two formations.|
25711|Clarke River Group|Age reasons|The Clarke River Group ranges from Tournaisian to Late Carboniferous (Jell & Playford, in press), but may extend down into the latest Devonian and up into the Early Permian. Several hiatuses (disconformities) could occur in the sequence.|
23490|Clemant Microgranite|Name source|The name is derived from the Parish of Clemant, County of Wilkie Gray.|
23490|Clemant Microgranite|Unit history|Wyatt & others (1970) mapped the Clemant Microgranite unnamed granite (C-Pg) and porphyritic microgranite (C-Pp).|
23490|Clemant Microgranite|Type section locality|A small area of outcrop protruding from the coastal alluvial plain 700-800m from the Bruce Highway (8159-144884) is designated as the type area.  The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.|
23490|Clemant Microgranite|Description at type locality|It consists of pink, abundantly porphyritic, biotite microgranite, containing large euhedral potassic feldspar phenocrysts that display rapakivi texture.|
23490|Clemant Microgranite|Extent|The Clemant Microgranite crops out in several areas in the northeast quarter of ROLLINGSTONE. The microgranite forms an irregularly shaped body 72km2 in area, forming the eastern margin of the Paluma Range between Hencamp and Leichhardt Creeks. It also forms an arcuate intrusive body or ring dyke (220km2 in area) cutting across the Paluma Range from the Black Fellow Creek area to the headwaters of Keelbottom Creek (East Branch), and three irregularly shaped bodies (1-3km2) in the centre of the Paluma Range.  The Clemant Microgranite is somewhat more recessive than the adjacent Paluma Rhyolite and Saint Giles Volcanics. This characteristic aided aerial photographic interpretation of boundaries within the tropical rain forest of the Paluma Range.|07/FEB/11
23490|Clemant Microgranite|Lithology|As in the type area, the Clemant Microgranite (CPgc) is grey to dark pink (predominantly pink), abundantly porphyritic, biotite microgranite. It is very similar to the Malmesbury Microgranite which crops out south of the Sybil Graben and was described by Scott (1988) and Gunther & Withnall (1992). The microgranite contains sparse dark, subrounded, dioritic xenoliths up to 5cm across.  Phenocrysts comprise 55-65% of the microgranite. Quartz phenocrysts (20-25%) are subhedral to euhedral, exhibit straight extinction, and are up to 5mm in diameter. K-feldspar (20-25%) forms large euhedral crystals up to 4cm long with rapakivi texture (albite rims 2 3mm wide).|07/FEB/11
23490|Clemant Microgranite|Relationships and boundaries|The Clemant Microgranite intrudes the Carboniferous Paluma Rhyolite, Saint Giles Volcanics, early Paalaozoic Holborn Granodiorite and Proterozoic(?) Argentine Metamorphics. The close spatial relationships with the Early Carboniferous Paluma Rhyolite and Saint Giles Volcanics and the fact that the Clemant Microgranite forms ring dykes, suggests that the microgranite may have intruded its own volcanic pile, with ring dykes forming during and after caldera collapse and resurgence.|
23490|Clemant Microgranite|Age reasons|The suggestion above is consistent with a U-Pb zircon (SHRIMP) age of 337±7 Ma on a sample from the Clemant Microgranite (8159-420858) (Appendix 1).  The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.|

24855|Cobbold Metadolerite|Name source|Cobbold Creek, which joins the Robertson River at GR 536182 (North Head 1:100 000 Sheet area).|
24855|Cobbold Metadolerite|Unit history|Cobbold Dolerite (White, 1959, 1965).|
24855|Cobbold Metadolerite|Geomorphic expression|Generally well exposed and forms prominent boulder-strewn hills in some places. The metadolerite has a dark red-brown to brown colour on aerial photographs.|
24855|Cobbold Metadolerite|Type section locality|White (1959) gave the type area of the Cobbold Dolerite simply as Cobbold Creek. As noted above, most of the basic rocks in Cobbold Creek are now interpreted as extrusives and mapped as Dead Horse Metabasalt. Probable metadolerite intruding the metabasalt crops out in Cobbold Creek at GR 520125 and 520109 (North Head 1:100 000 Sheet area), but because it is relatively uncommon there, reference localities are designated for the Cobbold Metadolerite. These are metadolerite and metagabbro outcrops along the Georgetown-Forsayth road at GR 656608 and 2 km north of the Lornevale turnoff (Georgetown 1:100 000 Sheet area), and along the Georgetown-Abingdon Downs road from GR 618966 to the Ironhurst turnoff at 604986 (Forest Home 1:100 000 Sheet area).|
24855|Cobbold Metadolerite|Extent|The Cobbold Metadolerite forms a multitude of separate intrusions, mainly sills, within the Robertson River Subgroup and Bernecker Creek Formation, in a belt up to 50 km wide, extending for about 150 km from near Gilberton homestead in the south to near Dagworth homestead in the north. Most amphibolite in the Einasleigh Metamorphics probably can be equated with the Cobbold Metadolerite, thus extending its distribution to most of the eastern two-thirds of the Georgetown Inlier.|
24855|Cobbold Metadolerite|Lithology|Metadolerite and metagabbro grading into amphibolite.|
24855|Cobbold Metadolerite|Relationships and boundaries|The Cobbold Metadolerite intrudes the Bernecker Creek Formation and Robertson River Subgroup, mainly as sills. None occurs in the conformably overlying Townley Formation. Much of the amphibolite in the Einasleigh Metamorphics probably can be equated with the Cobbold Metadolerite, although some is known to be extrusive in origin. The Dead Horse Metabasalt is probably comagmatic with some of the Cobbold Metadolerite.|
24855|Cobbold Metadolerite|Identifying features|All metamorphosed basic rocks in the Georgetown Inlier were assigned to the Cobbold Dolerite by White (1959, 1965). However, many basic rocks, including most of those in the type area, are now recognised as extrusive metabasalt, and assigned to the Dead Horse Metabasalt. Withnall & others (1980) abandoned usage of the name Cobbold Dolerite for the basic intrusives but did not rename them. The rocks form a multitude of separate intrusions (see Distribution). However, they are all petrographically and chemically similar, and probably genetically related, although they may have been intruded in at least two separate pulses during the deposition of the Robertson River Subgroup. It is convenient to assign them to a single named unit as has been done for small but geographically separate granitoid plutons in the Georgetown area (Withnall & others, 1976). The name Cobbold Dolerite is well established in the literature, and should be retained, but because the primary igneous minerals have mostly been altered, the name Cobbold Metadolerite is proposed. The unit is redefined to incorporate two reference localities into the definition.|
24855|Cobbold Metadolerite|Age reasons|Intruded during deposition of the Robertson River Subgroup. The minimum age of 1570+/-20 m.y. (mid-Proterozoic) obtained for the Etheridge Group (Black & others, 1979), therefore also applies to the Cobbold Metadolerite.|

25854|Cone Creek Metabasalt Member|Geomorphic expression|The unit forms scattered outcrops in low rises and plains in the eastern areas, and low rocky hills in the north and northwest.|
25854|Cone Creek Metabasalt Member|Type section locality|An east-west section 4 km north of Mitakoodi Siding and 32 km southwest of Cloncurry, from latitude 20o54'S, longitude 140o17'E to latitude 20o54'S, longitude 140o19'E, i.e. grid reference 6956-251870 (base) to 6956-285870 (top). Thickness of the metabasalt is about 2500 m. Outcrop in the type section is good, and as in most other areas occupied by the member, the unit is cut by a network of dolerite dykes.|
25854|Cone Creek Metabasalt Member|Extent|This is the most extensive member of the Marraba Volcanics. North of 21oS latitude it forms a continuous M-shaped belt between 140o3'E and 140o19'E longitude, in the north-plunging Duck Creek and Bulonga anticlines (Fig. 1). The eastern limb of the Duck Creek anticline contains a discontinuous extension of the member to 21o42'S latitude. The member has been mapped in detail in the Marraba 1:100 000 Sheet area, and is known to occur in the Malbon and Mount Merlin 1:100 000 Sheet areas.|
25854|Cone Creek Metabasalt Member|Thickness range|Thickness ranges from about 2800 m in the east to 900 m in the west.|
25854|Cone Creek Metabasalt Member|Lithology|Massive metabasalt, amygdaloidal metabasalt; minor arkose, agglomerate, and siltstone. The rocks have been metamorphosed in the greenschist facies.|
25854|Cone Creek Metabasalt Member|Relationships and boundaries|The Cone Creek Metabasalt Member overlies the Argylla Formation apparently conformably, and is overlain conformably by the Mount Start Member of the Marraba Volcanics. The Wimberu Granite and numerous dolerite dykes and sills intrude the member.|
24864|Constance Sandstone|Name source|From the Constance Range, a prominent escarpment trending meridionally through western LAWN HILL, northwestern Queensland.|11/NOV/10
24864|Constance Sandstone|Constituents|The formation comprises several sandstone and siltstone members, from base to top: Hedleys Sandstone Member* Pandanus Siltstone Member, Burangoo Sandstone Member* Wallis Siltstone Member, Schultz Sandstone Member* (which includes the rocks formerly assigned to the now obsolete Bowthorn Siltstone Member).|11/NOV/10
24864|Constance Sandstone|Geomorphic expression|Ridge and plateau forming, as the formation is dominated by resistant sandstone. Several siltstone members are recessive and form valleys or plains between sandstone uplands.|11/NOV/10
24864|Constance Sandstone|Type section locality|Stated by Carter et al (1961) to be "from lat. 18deg27'35'S, long. 138deg17'00', east-south-east about 4 miles to the base of the formation." Reference sections: The type section nominated by Carter et al (1961) contains minor faulting and folding, and is far from the best section within LAWN HILL. Nor does it contain any of the siltstone members recognised by Roberts et al (1963) or Grimes & Sweet (1979) in CALVERT HILLS and WESTMORELAND respectively. Accordingly, two reference sections have been nominated to address these shortcomings. Reference section A is a more compact section (than the type section) in northern LAWN HILL, but neither does it contain the siltstone members. Reference section B, in WESTMORELAND, includes all the siltstone and sandstone members that are recognised in outcrops north of the Elizabeth Creek Fault Zone, but because of faulting does not include the uppermost part of the formation (this is included in the type section for the Schultz Sandstone Member). Both reference sections are more easily accessed from existing tracks than is the type section. Section A, in the Constance Range escarpment 4 km south of Elizabeth Creek, runs from the base of the Constance Sandstone, at Latitude 18deg14'41"S Longitude 138deg23'28"E (224125E 7980770N), southwest for 1.7 km to the top of the Constance Sandstone, at Latitude 18deg14'57"S Longitude 138deg22'37"E (222623E 7980270N). It is accessed from a station track following Elizabeth Creek. Section B, in southwestern WESTMORELAND, begins at Latitude 17deg52'50'" Longitude 138deg3'42"E (188622E 8020570N) and runs along Gorge Creek for 9.3 km, mostly south to south-southeast, ending at Latitude 17deg57'47"S Longitude 138deg4'49"E (190723E 8011471N), against a fault within the Nicholson River Fault Zone. It is accessed from an old exploration track from the access road into Nadjaburra Aboriginal settlement. A more compact section showing the siltstone members is not possible, because dips in the region are so low, and steeper-dipping sections are fault-affected.|11/NOV/10
24864|Constance Sandstone|Extent|Widely distributed in northwestern LAWN HILL and southwestern WESTMORELAND (both in Queensland), and southern CALVERT HILLS, and eastern MOUNT DRUMMOND (both in the Northern Territory).|11/NOV/10
24864|Constance Sandstone|Thickness range|Estimated by Carter et al (1961) to range from 300 to 1100 m in LAWN HILL; thickness in the type section cannot easily be estimated because of structural complexity. It also reaches up to 1100 m in southwestern WESTMORELAND and northeastern MOUNT DRUMMOND, and thins to less than 100 m in central MOUNT DRUMMOND. Reference section A is around 800 m thick, and Section B approaches 1100 m (Sweet et al 1981).|11/NOV/10
24864|Constance Sandstone|Lithology|Very fine- to coarse-grained, and granule-rich to pebbly sandstones, ranging from lithic to quartzose; most are in the sub-lithic category.|11/NOV/10
24864|Constance Sandstone|Depositional environment|Most sandstones are trough cross-bedded, and indicate shallow marine, intertidal or shelf environments. The very fine sandstones are associated with siltstone and shale intervals, and indicate storm-dominated shelf facies. Planar bedding, current lineation and current and wave ripples, and mudstone intraclasts are common; desiccation cracks are rare.|11/NOV/10
24864|Constance Sandstone|Relationships and boundaries|Lies with pronounced angular unconformity, or disconformity, on the McNamara Group in eastern MOUNT DRUMMOND, LAWN HILL and WESTMORELAND. In western MOUNT DRUMMOND it lies mainly disconformably, but locally with angular unconformity, on the Wild Cow Subgroup. The upper contact, with the Mullera Formation, is apparently sharp but conformable; it appears to be a rapid transition over a metre or so into shale and fine siltstone. Overlain unconformably by Cambrian and Cretaceous rocks.|11/NOV/10
24864|Constance Sandstone|Age reasons|The interpreted age range for the whole South Nicholson Group, of 1500-1400 Ma, is based on its correlation with the Roper Group of the southern McArthur Basin (Dunn et al 1966) with which it makes up the Roper Superbasin (Jackson et al 1999, Abbott and Sweet 2000, Abbott et al 2001). Ages of 1492±4 and 1493±4 Ma for tuffaceous material from the lower Roper Group (Jackson et al 1999) provide the most reliable estimate for the age of that Group, and hence for the lower South Nicholson Group. The Constance Sandstone is judged to lie near the middle of the age range 1500-1400 Ma, given that the whole Wild Cow Subgroup lies beneath it in western MOUNT DRUMMOND.|11/NOV/10
24864|Constance Sandstone|Correlations|None known, but it is likely that a sandstone unit/s in the middle Renner Group (Hussey et al 2001) and the Roper Group (Jackson et al 1999) are in part correlative, given the overall correlation between these groups.|

24222|Coocerina Formation|Name source|The Coocerina Formation is named after the Coocerina copper mine 19 km west-northwest of Quamby (latitude 20o16'50"S, longitude 140o7'48"E; GR 092572).|
24222|Coocerina Formation|Unit history|The Coocerina Formation was included in the Corella Formation by Carter & others (1961) but placed in the Knapdale Quartzite by Wilson & others (1979b).|
24222|Coocerina Formation|Geomorphic expression|The unit is characterised by low elevations and little relief. It forms a gently undulating plain with local moderately incised drainage.|
24222|Coocerina Formation|Type section locality|The type section is defined as an east-west section extending 500 m from the base of the scarp which marks the western edge of the Knapdale Range 1 km south of the Coocerina mine (latitude 20o17'25"S, longitude 140o7'45"E, GR 092562) to the track which provides access along the western side of the range at latitude 20o17'25"S, longitude 140o7'30"E (GR 087562). The section is moderately to poorly exposed and consists of grey siltstone, black shale, scapolitic siltstone, and muscovite-biotite schist which have a total thickness of approximately 400 m.|
24222|Coocerina Formation|Extent|The unit is exposed as a narrow north-trending belt immediately west of the Knapdale Range near the middle of the Quamby 1:100 000 Sheet area. The total area of outcrop is 4 km2.|
24222|Coocerina Formation|Thickness range|The formation is approximately 400 m thick everywhere along its exposure.|
24222|Coocerina Formation|Lithology|The Coocerina Formation consists of grey, mostly calcareous black shale, scapolitic siltstone, and minor pyritic shale, black to bluish grey micaceous metasiltstone, fine-grained sandstone, and laminated calcareous granofels. Strongly fractured and sheared grey scapolitic siltstone commonly occurs near the contact with the Knapdale Quartzite.|
24222|Coocerina Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The Coocerina Formation conformably overlies the Knapdale Quartzite. The boundary is locally sheared but the grain size grades abruptly from the sandstone of the older unit into the siltstone of the younger unit. This boundary coincides with the base of the scarp which marks the western edge of Knapdale Quartzite. The upper contact of the Coocerina formation is faulted and poorly exposed. It is defined by the change from grey siltstone and granofels to the black or dark brown laminated dolomite of the Lady Clayre Dolomite. The relationship is interpreted to be conformable because of the general parallelism of bedding in both units adjacent to the boundary.|
24222|Coocerina Formation|Structure and Metamorphism|Bedding in the Coocerina Formation generally dips about 60o to the west. Younging is also to the west in the few places it has been determined. Bedding is steeper in the north and dips are to the west-northwest. The siltstone near the base of the unit is commonly fractured whereas the upper part of the unit is mostly schistose. Mineral elongation is recognised in the south. The rocks in the formation appear to be metamorphosed within the lower greenschist facies. Scapolite porphyroblasts are widely developed and some of calcareous granofels contains actinolite porphyroblasts.|
24222|Coocerina Formation|Age reasons|The age of the Coocerina Formation is poorly constrained. It is younger than the Corella Formation which was deposited between 1760 and 1740 Ma age (Page, 1981), and older than the regional metamorphism which occurred between 1450 and 1670 Ma (Page, 1978).|
24222|Coocerina Formation|Comments|Discussion: Both the Coocerina Formation and the White Blow Formation which crops out 55 km to the southwest in the Mary Kathleen 1:100 000 Sheet area (Derrick & others, 1977b) overlie thick quartzose units (Knapdale Quartzite and Deighton Quartzite) which disconformably or unconformably overlie the Corella Formation. The quartzites were correlated by Carter & others (1961) and Derrick & others (1977a). Therefore, the Coocerina Formation probably can be correlated with the White Blow Formation and included in the Mount Albert Group of Derrick & others (1977a).|
27285|Corbett Formation|Name source|Parish of Corbett, County of Victor.|
27285|Corbett Formation|Geomorphic expression|The Corbett Formation forms hilly terrain, although the schist facies has more subdued relief. Bedding trends are generally poorly developed except for the ridge-forming interval at the top of the formation.|
27285|Corbett Formation|Type section locality|A complete section is exposed along Slatey Creek for about 2.5 km between GR 479125 (base) and 477150 (top) (North Head 1:100 000 Sheet area), and is designated as the holostratotype. The lower part of the formation is grey, slightly carbonaceous, laminated, cleaved mudstone, whereas the upper part consists of a monotonous sequence of greenish grey, only sparsely laminated, cleaved mudstone, locally containing chloritoid. All of the rocks are well cleaved to phyllitic. The thickness of the section is not known because of the lack of bedding and probable repetition by folding. A maximum of 1500 m is present but the true thicknesss is probably less than 1000 m. This section was formerly a reference section (hypostratotype) designated by Withnall & Mackenzie (1980) for the Robertson River Formation, which is now redefined as a supgroup.|
27285|Corbett Formation|Description at type locality|Reference section: Better exposed, but incomplete sections of the Corbett Formation crop out in the Percy River for about 0.6 km between GR 617802 (base) and a synclinal hinge at 615808 (Bellfield 1:100 000 Sheet area), and for about 3.5 km along Stake Yard Creek, from the Forsayth-North Head road crossing at GR 400192 to 413159 (top), (North Head 1:100 000 Sheet area). These are designated as parastratotypes and contain similar rocks to those in the holostratotype.  The section along Kangaroo Creek between GR 674142 and 670183 (Forsayth 1:100 000 Sheet area) provides a parastratotype for the 'schist facies' of the unit. It contains mica schist, commonly with biotite and staurolite porphyroblasts, and includes the Tin Hill Quartzite Member (Withnall & Mackenzie, 1980).|
27285|Corbett Formation|Extent|The Corbett Formtion crops out from near Gilberton homestead to near North Head homestead, and from there, it extends east for about 40 km between the Robertson River and Ropewalk Range. Further north it forms a narrow belt between Lornevale and Mount Turner homesteads, and then northeast to the Newcastle Range. The total area is about 1000 km2.|
27285|Corbett Formation|Thickness range|Probably up to 1000 m, but repetition by complex, multiple folding prevents measurement of thickness in many areas.|
27285|Corbett Formation|Lithology|Cleaved phyllitic mudstone as in the type section. This grades eastwards into mica schist which commonly contains porphyroblasts of garnet, staurolite and andalusite in the lower amphibolite facies. Porphyroblasts of biotite are also common and persist to higher grades. A distinctive, thin, pure quartzite unit, the Tin Hill Quartzite Member, occurs within the 'schist facies' of the formation.|
27285|Corbett Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The Corbett Formation conformably overlies the Dead Horse Metabasalt. In the northern area, where the metabasalt is absent, the Corbett Formation conformably overlies the Daniel Creek Formation, from which it is distinguished by its lack of quartzite. The Lane Creek Formation conformably overlies the Corbett Formation and is recognised by its abundant carbonaceous rocks. A resistant ridge-forming interval of more quartzose phyllite marks the top of the formation in many places. This can be traced into the 'schist facies' in places, but where it is absent, the Corbett Formation schists can also be distinguished from those in the Lane Creek Formation by the presence of staurolite and/or biotite porphyroblasts. The Tin Hill Quartzite Member which was formerly defined as a member of the Robertson River Formation, is now a member of the Corbett Formation. The Corbett Formation is intruded by sills of Proterozoic Cobbold Metadolerite, as well as by numerous Proterozoic granitoids of the Forsayth Batholith, and some late Palaeozoic hypabyssal rocks. The formation is unconformably overlain by the Devonian-Carboniferous Gilberton Formation, the late Palaeozoic Newcastle Range and Agate Creek volcanics, and the Jurassic Hampstead Sandstone.|
27285|Corbett Formation|Age reasons|The minimum age of 1570+/-20 Ma (mid-Proterozoic) obtained for the Etheridge Group (Black & others, 1979) also applies to the Corbett Formation.|
4749|Corrie Member|Name source|From Corrie Downs Property (140'06", 22o18"), Boulia 1:250 000 Sheet area.|
4749|Corrie Member|Unit history|Generally equates with Unit 5 of Casey (1968), Member (iv) of Druce (1976), and the Encrinite Member of Jones et al. (1971).|
4749|Corrie Member|Type section locality|Black Mountain (140o17'E, 22o32'S), the interval between 500 m and 590 m within the Ninmaroo Formation from 251094 (140o16'15"E, 22o31'15"S) to 246097 (140o16'00", 22o31'05"S).|
4749|Corrie Member|Extent|The unit extends as a 95 km belt from Mt Datson in the south to the Swift Hills in the north.|
4749|Corrie Member|Thickness range|90 m at Black Mountain; 200 m at Mt Datson; 170 m at Mt Ninmaroo.|
4749|Corrie Member|Lithology|Medium to thick bedded limestone (pelmatozoan grainstone (grain supported carbonate rocks (Dunham, 1962)) ooid and peloidal (pellet-like) grainstone, skeletal peloidal clast grainstone); minor cross-stratified dolomitic sandstone.|
4749|Corrie Member|Relationships and boundaries|The unit conformably overlies the Mort Member and is conformably overlain by the Datson Member. The unit is characterised by encrinites (pelmatozoan grainstones): they are usually light grey, weather spheroidally and have uniform crystalline textured appearance.|
4749|Corrie Member|Age reasons|Apart from pelmatozoan fragments the unit has yielded conodonts which indicate an Early Ordovician (middle Warendian) age (Jones et al. 1971).|

27951|Cowie Granite|Name source|Named after Cowie prospect, GR 862890, 10 km ESE of Squirrel Hills homestead, Selwyn 1:100 000 Sheet area, Duchess 1:250 000 Sheet area.|
27951|Cowie Granite|Unit history|Like all other granites in the eastern part of the Duchess 1:250 000 Sheet area, the Cowie granite was mapped as Williams Granite by Carter & Opik (1963).|
27951|Cowie Granite|Type section locality|In the vicinity of GR 855937, 5 km NNW of Cowie prospect, where the unit forms undulating terrain with extensive low rocky and rubbly exposures of heterogeneous, leucocratic, granitic rocks.|
27951|Cowie Granite|Extent|Crops out in belt up to 3 km wide trending NNE for 11.5 km from a point 4.5 km W of Cowie prospect, Selwyn 1:100 000 Sheet area. The outcrop area is centred on GR 855940.|
27951|Cowie Granite|Lithology|The unit consists of heterogeneous, biotite-bearing leucocratic granite, granodiorite and tonalite. The granitic rocks range from fine-grained to pegmatitic, and from massive to foliated; they are commonly xenolithic, but not porphyritic.|
27951|Cowie Granite|Relationships and boundaries|Cowie Granite intrudes and locally forms migmatitic complexes with the Soldiers Cap Group and also intrudes the Doherty Formation (new name). It is inferred to be intruded by Squirrel Hills Granite to the west, and is cut by porphyritic microgranite considered to be related to the Squirrel Hills Granite.|
27951|Cowie Granite|Age reasons|Proterozoic.|
27951|Cowie Granite|Comments|Differs petrographically from, and inferred to be older than, adjacent Squirrel Hills Granite to the west. It is separated geographically from the petrographically similar and probably related Blackeye Granite to the east and Maramungee Granite to the north, and is one of the granites previously mapped as Williams Granite which together with the Wimberu Granite to the west, make up the Williams Batholith (new structural term).|
27755|Cromwell Metabasalt Member|Name source|From Cromwell Creek, about 64 km north-northeast of Mount Isa, latitude 20o9'S, longitude 139o39'E, and 3 km southwest of Julius dam. The name "Cromwell Beds" was introduced as an informal name by Robinson (1968); the redefined Cromwell Metabasalt Member includes the "Paroo Beds" of Robinson, as well as the "Cromwell Beds", since the distinction between these units (differences in the proportions of basalt and minor sediment) cannot be sustained with certainty over large areas of the Eastern Creek Volcanics.|
27755|Cromwell Metabasalt Member|Type section locality|From 8 to 2 km east of Mount Isa, just south of the Cloncurry road i.e. 6856 511077 to 6856 452074. This type section was nominated by Robinson (1968) and by Carter et al. (1961). Another reference section is in the Gum Creek area, 16 km northeast of Mount Isa. The type section contains 3600 m of massive amygdaloidal metabasalt and sheared basic rocks interbedded with thin quartzite, epidote quartzite, dolomitic siltstone and tuff. Flows are up to 60 m thick and predominate over sediments.|
27755|Cromwell Metabasalt Member|Extent|As for the Eastern Creek Volcanics, in a north-trending belt (centred on Mount Isa) 300 km long and up to 40 km wide, mainly in the Cloncurry, Urandangi, Dobbyn, and Mount Isa 1:250 000 Sheets.|
27755|Cromwell Metabasalt Member|Thickness range|Thickness ranges from 1750 m to 5430 m east and northeast of Mt Isa. A thickness of 3900 m is quoted by Robinson (1968).|
27755|Cromwell Metabasalt Member|Lithology|Metabasalt, amygdaloidal metabasalt, flow top breccia, sandstone, dolomitic sandstone, siltstone, chert, quartzite.|
27755|Cromwell Metabasalt Member|Relationships and boundaries|Overlie the Mount Guide Quartzite and Leander Quartzite, and underlies the Lena Quartzite Member conformably. Locally it overlies the basement unconformably viz. at Dynamite Creek, 140 km north of Mount Isa, conglomeratic arkose of the basal Eastern Creek Volcanics overlies the Ewen Granite unconformably (Carter et al., 1961).|
27755|Cromwell Metabasalt Member|Age reasons|Carpentarian, between 1700 and 1650 m.y. (Plumb & Derrick, 1975).|
27755|Cromwell Metabasalt Member|Comments|Remarks: The unit was designated the "Cromwell-Paroo Metabasalt member" on the BMR Preliminary Edition of the Mary Kathleen 1:100 000 Sheet area, and the Cromwell Metabasalt Member in the subsequent First Edition map in preparation.|
27382|Crooked Creek Conglomerate|Name source|Crooked Creek, a tributary of Dinner Creek, which it joins at 7859-776864.  The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.|
27382|Crooked Creek Conglomerate|Unit history|The unit was previously defined as the Crooked Creek Conglomerate Member of the Graveyard Creek Formation (now Group) (White, 1959, 1962, 1965).  It was given formation status by Withnall & others (1988), but not formally redefined.|
27382|Crooked Creek Conglomerate|Geomorphic expression|The unit forms generally subdued topography, but slightly more elevated than the Quinton Formation, with weak strike trends discernible on aerial photographs.  Where outcrop is poor, a litter of pebbles and cobbles on the ground serve to indicate the presence of the unit.|
27382|Crooked Creek Conglomerate|Type section locality|White (1959) gave the type area in Dinner and Crooked Creeks.  A type section is chosen in Dinner Creek between 7859 784867 (base) and 754870 (synclinal hinge).  Polymictic pebble to boulder conglomerate (abundant clasts of amphibolite, granite, schist), lithic arenite, and minor mudstone.  Thickness is unknown because of small-scale folding.REFERENCE SECTION::   The other part of White's type area in Crooked Creek, between 7859 725842 (base) and 760837 (synclinal hinge) is designated as a reference section.  The rocks are similar to those in the type section, but clasts of amphibolite are dominant.|
27382|Crooked Creek Conglomerate|Extent|.  A southwest trending belt, between Dinner Creek and Gray Creek   rocks near Top Hut Yards are also assigned to unit.|
27382|Crooked Creek Conglomerate|Thickness range|0 to 300 m at least.|
27382|Crooked Creek Conglomerate|Lithology|Pebble to boulder, polymictic conglomerate, lithic arenite, and minor mudstone.  The rocks are thick to very thick bedded, but commonly massive and poorly bedded.  The beds have common erosive bases, local grading and pebble imbrication, and rare medium to large scale cross bedding.  Large olistoliths of amphibolite and limestone occur locally.|
27382|Crooked Creek Conglomerate|Fossils|Corals and conodonts in limestone clasts indicate a Silurian age (probably Llandovery from stratigraphic relationships)|
27382|Crooked Creek Conglomerate|Relationships and boundaries|The unit is the basal part of the Graveyard Creek Group, and unconformably overlies Judea Formation, and is faulted against and possibly locally unconformably overlies the Proterozoic Halls Reward Metamorphics.  It is conformably overlain by the Quinton Formation from which it is distinguished by the abundance of polymictic conglomerate.|

4958|Crows Nest Granite|Unit history|This name, first used by Jones (1955), was formally defined by Cranfield and Schwarzbock (1974b).|
4958|Crows Nest Granite|Geomorphic expression|The outcrop area forms a north-northwesterly trending belt occupying approximately 100 km2 and is bounded by Pierce's Creek to the north, and the Esk-Hampton Road to the south.  The average elevation is 470 m; however, in places (e. g. near Perseverance Creek Dam), coarser-grained variants form steep cliffs up to 630 m above sea level.|
4958|Crows Nest Granite|Type section locality|.  The type locality extends along the Crow's Nest-Perseverance Creek Dam road from about AMG 40980 69803 to 41180 69813.  The grid references are based on the AGD66 datum.|
4958|Crows Nest Granite|Lithology|Cranfield & others (1976) described the constituent rock types as granite, with minor adamellite and pegmatite.  Under the UIGS nomenclature both granite and adamellite are now considered as granite.  Petrologically they consist of coarse perthitic intergrowths, minor oligoclase, quartz, biotite altering to chlorite, and euhedral sphene accessories (up to 3 mm in diameter).  Cranfield & others (1976) described late stage hydrothermal alteration of the granite producing kaolinitic clay at about AMG 4070 69920.  A pegmatitic phase of the granite occurs in the vicinity of Perseverance Creek, where cassiterite and fluorite occur as accessory minerals.  Minor aplite dykes that are more common south of Ballard Creek cut the unit.  The unit is conspicuously jointed, with a dominant easterly trend and a strong complementary northerly trend. The locus of intrusion of late stage emanations from the granite (e. g. aplite dykes and volatiles) is controlled by these two master joint systems, so that the late stage aptite dykes and veins are elongated east-west.  The unit was mapped in student project theses by Will (1974), Vonhoff (1975) and Holden (1991).   Holden (1991) recognised 5 granite members and an aplite member that forms a marginal phase and numerous dykes.  He informally named these units `Rocky Creek Granite¿, Central Granite, `Vonhoff Granite¿, `Woodville Granite¿ Paradise graniteand the `Rangeview Aplite¿.  The approximate location and outcrop and thin section characteristics of his subdivisions are given in Table 12 (Cranfield et al 2001).  Holden (1991) also recognised three phases of dykes in the granite ¿ aplite within the Crows Nest Granite, dolerite in the Sugarloaf metamorphics and rhyolite in the Eskdale Granodiorite.|
4958|Crows Nest Granite|Relationships and boundaries|Holden (1991) could not identify the relative ages between his different subunits of the Crows Nest granite.  The granite intrudes the Sugarloaf Metamorphics and the Permian Cressbrook Creek Group and is unconformably overlain by the Triassic- Jurassic Bundamba Group and the Tertiary Main Range Volcanics.  The zone of hornfels of the Crow's Nest Granite is very narrow, usually less than 30 m, and is best represented in the vicinity of Pierce's Creek where a zone of dark brown flinty hornfels is developed in the Sugarloaf Metamorphics.  The relationship of the Crows Nest granite to the Eskdale Igneous Complex is unknown. Clowes (1997) considered there were two possibilities: -- The Crows Nest granite intruded prior to the Eskdale and the Eskdale intruded through it leaving roof pendants of Crows Nest Granite at the core of unit Rges1 alternatively,- The Crows Nest Granite represents a fractionated product of the Eskdale.  Clowes (1997) indicated that there were no definite geochemical trends to support this proposal.|
4958|Crows Nest Granite|Age reasons|Radiometric dating of biotite from this granite has given ages of 234 and 237 +/- 8 Ma, (K/Ar) and 242Ma (Rb/Sr), indicating a Late Permian or Early Triassic age.|
4958|Crows Nest Granite|Comments|GEOCHEMISTRY::  Holden (1991) carried out geochemistry on the Crows Nest Granite and showed that each of the phases had very similar spidergram patterns.  The CIPW mineralogy of the samples indicated normative corundum and hypersthene which was interpreted by Holden (1991) to indicate that the Crows nest granite had an s-type affinity.|

4968|Croydon Volcanic Group|Name source|The name is derived from Croydon township, at grid reference (GR) 7361 (CROYDON 1:100 000 Sheet) 315868, or 142o21'E, 18o10'S.|
4968|Croydon Volcanic Group|Unit history|Jensen (1923) used the name 'Croydon Series' for the igneous rocks of the Croydon area, and Honman (1937) used the term 'Croydon Felsite' for the volcanic rocks of the area. White (1959) defined 'Croydon Felsite', then changed the name to 'Croydon Volcanics' (White, 1965), which was redefined by Branch (1966). Mackenzie (1983) informally named and described the 'Croydon volcanic group'.|
4968|Croydon Volcanic Group|Constituents|The Croydon Volcanic Group consists of the following units, in descending stratigraphic order: Idalia Rhyolite, including Democrat Rhyolite Member. Carron Rhyolite, including Littleton Dacite Member. Parrot Camp Rhyolite, including Nancy Lee Sandstone Member. B Creek Rhyolite. Wonnemarra Rhyolite. Goat Creek Andesite. Wallabadah Siltstone.|
4968|Croydon Volcanic Group|Extent|The Croydon Volcanic Group extends over approximately 3100 km2 from the Carron River in the north (17o57'S) to the Yappar River in the south (19o04'S), from the Gilbert River in the northeast to the Croydon area (about 142o11'E) in the northwest, and from near the Langdon River in the east (142o58'E) to between 142o42' and 142o27' in the southern and central areas.|
4968|Croydon Volcanic Group|Lithology|Rhyolitic to rhyodacitic ignimbrite makes up the bulk of the Croydon Volcanic Group; dacitic ignimbrite, rhyolitic to dacitic lava, basaltic andesite, and quartzose sandstone and siltstone are minor constituents, and rhyolitic tuff is rare. Most rocks are characterised by the presence of up to 1-2 percent graphite, either disseminated or in rounded pellets up to 1 cm in diameter.|
4968|Croydon Volcanic Group|Relationships and boundaries|The Croydon Volcanic Group is flanked to the east by low-grade metasedimentary rocks of the Early to Middle Proterozoic Etheridge and Langlovale Groups (Withnall & Mackenzie, 1980, 1983). For most of its length, the contact is faulted, but in places it appears to be an angular unconformity (e.g. north of Snake Creek where the Wonnemarra Rhyolite overlies the Proterozoic metasediments). The volcanics are intruded by Middle Proterozoic Esmeralda, Nonda, Mooremount, Little Bird, Chadshunt, Macartneys, Olsens, Dregger, Bimba, and Illewanna Granites, by the Permian Awring Granodiorite, and the Permian? Wallys Dolerite. The Group is unconformably overlain by the Middle to Late Proterozoic Inorunie Group, the Permian Bullseye Rhyolite, Linley Rhyolite, Little Pocket Dacite, and McFarlanes Andesite, the Mesozoic Eulo Queen Group, Gilbert River Formation, and Wallumbilla Formation, the late Mesozoic to Tertiary Bulimba Formation, and late Tertiary to Quaternary fluviatile and residual sediments including the Claraville Formation.|
4968|Croydon Volcanic Group|Age reasons|The Idalia Rhyolite and Democrat Rhyolite Member have been isotopically dated at 1400+/-75 Ma (Richards & others, 1966; Black, 1973). Preliminary results of a re-evaluation of the Rb/Sr isochron and elimination of determinations from altered and/or weathered samples show that the age may be closer to 1440 Ma (R. Holmes, pers. comm., 1984).|
24233|Culba Granodiorite|Name source|Parish of Culba, County of Percy|
24233|Culba Granodiorite|Unit history|Previously mapped as Dumbano Granite (White, 1962).|
24233|Culba Granodiorite|Type section locality|Between GR 027 678 and 008 690 (Gilberton 1:100 000 Sheet area), upstream along Pinnacle Creek and one of its tributaries. Grey medium grained equigranular hornblende-biotite granodiorite is exposed between GR 027 678 and 014 688, and pink fine grained biotite granite is exposed between GR 014 688 and 008 690.|
24233|Culba Granodiorite|Extent|Forms the northern part of the Glenmore batholith about 12 km west of Glenmore homestead. The intrusion is 9 km long (from north to south) and 5 km wide in the north, tapering southwards. The total area is about 35 km2.|
24233|Culba Granodiorite|Lithology|Two rock types as described in the type area; the fine to medium grained, equigranular, non-foliated hornblende-biotite granodiorite is the most extensive; the younger, generally finer grained biotite granite is restricted to the southwestern margin of the unit.|
24233|Culba Granodiorite|Relationships and boundaries|Intrudes the Proterozoic Einasleigh Metamorphics and late Proterozoic or Devonian Anning Granite and Dumbano Granite. Intruded by members of the Carboniferous Bagstowe Ring Complex.|
24233|Culba Granodiorite|Age reasons|Probably Carboniferous; it has a massive, unfoliated character and is petrographically similar to other late Palaeozoic granitoids in north Queensland, e.g. the Yataga Granodiorite (Withnall & others, 1976).|

24237|Curlew Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The base of the formation is conformable with the Rundle Formation and is defined by a thick (generally about 20 metres) interbedded carbonaceous shale and grey claystone bed which grades into carbonaceous oil shale, for up to 5 metres, above the contact with the Rundle Formation. The top of the formation is eroded. It is unconformably overlain by Quaternary overburden, and is faulted against Palaeozoic rocks (basement) at the western margin of The Narrows Graben.|
24237|Curlew Formation|Age reasons|The Curlew Formation is middle to late Eocene on megaspore evidence (Foster and Harris, 1981).|

26300|Daniel Creek Formation|Geomorphic expression|The unit produces moderate to hilly relief with moderate to good exposure in the Gilberton and Forsayth areas. In the Georgetown area, it has more subdued relief and poor exposure. Well-defined bedding trends occur in some areas, particularly where quartzite is more abundant.|
26300|Daniel Creek Formation|Type section locality|The holostratotype is along the Percy River for about 1.4 km, between GR 633788 (Gilberton 1:100 000 Sheet area) and 622796 (Bellfield, 1:100 000 Sheet area). This was formerly a reference section (hypostratotype) designated by Withnall & Mackenzie (1980) for the Robertson River Formation which is now redefined as a subgroup. In this section, which is about 1000 m thick, the unit consists predominantly of cleaved mudstone and siltstone with lesser amounts of fine-grained, locally slightly calcareous, subfeldspathic to quartzose sandstone. However, towards the top, several hundred metres of the sequence contains up to 50 percent of thick-bedded sandstone. The sandstone beds are laminated and locally cross-bedded on a small scale. They commonly contain ellipsoidal calcareous concretions. This sandy interval is thought to be equivalent to the Mount Helpman Member, mapped in the higher grade parts of the formation (see below).|
26300|Daniel Creek Formation|Description at type locality|Reference section: The section exposed downstream along Bull Creek and one of its tributaries from GR 737106 to 711149 (Forsayth 1:100 000 Sheet area) is designated as a reference section (parastratotype) for the 'schist facies' (inferred to be the base and top of the unit respectively). The rocks exposed in this section are mica schist, micaceous quartzite and minor calc-silicate rocks. This section includes the type section (holostratotype) of the Mount Helpman Member (GR 723132 to 714147).|
26300|Daniel Creek Formation|Extent|The main outcrop area is in the Gilberton and Forsayth 1:100 000 Sheet areas, and extends from the Gilberton Fault north to about the Robertson River. In this area it is infolded with the Bernecker Creek Formation, Dead Horse Metabasalt, and Corbett Formation. In the Georgetown and Forest Home 1:100 000 Sheet areas, it extends from Talbot Creek north for about 40 km along the western side of the Newcastle Range, and as screens in the Forsayth Batholith for 15 km to northwest of Georgetown. The total area is about 1500 km2.|
26300|Daniel Creek Formation|Thickness range|In the Gilberton area, the formation is 1000 to 2000 m thick. Elsewhere the thickness cannot be determined because of repetition byh the complex multiple folding events.|
26300|Daniel Creek Formation|Lithology|Cleaved mudstone, siltstone and sandstone as in the type section grading eastwards into mica schist, quartzite and minor calc-silicate rocks.|
26300|Daniel Creek Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The formation is the lowermost unit of the Robertson River Subgroup. It conformably overlies the Bernecker Creek Formation, and the base is defined by the change from predominantly calcareous to non-calcareous sandstone, siltstone and mudstone (or their metamorphic equivalents). In the Gilberton area the formation is conformably overlain by the Dead Horse Metabasalt is absent. In the Georgetown area however, the Dead Horse Metabasalt is absent and schistose equivalents of the Daniel Creek Formation are conformably overlain by the Corbett Formation, which is distinguished by its lack of quartzite. The Mount Helpman Member, which is characterised by a greater abundance of micaceous quartzite, has been mapped in the higher-grade (schist facies) of the Daniel Creek Formation. Its low-grade equivalents have been recognised in some sections, but have not been mapped out. The Daniel Creek Formation is thought to be a more pelitic lateral equivalent of the biotite gneiss facies of the Einasleigh Metamorphics; mica schist of the Daniel Creek Formation grades into biotite gneiss of the Einasleigh Metamorphics with increasing feldspar content. The Daniel Creek Formation is intruded by sills of Proterozoic Cobbold Metadolerite, as well as by numerous Proterozoic granitoids, the Siluro-Devonian Robin Hood Granodiorite, and late Palaeozoic hypabyssal rocks. The formation is unconformably overlain by the Devonian-Carboniferous Gilberton Formation, the late Palaeozoic Newcastle Range and Agate Creek Volcanics, and the Jurassic Hampstead Sandstone.|
26300|Daniel Creek Formation|Age reasons|The minimum age of 1570+/-20 m.y. (mid-Proterozoic) obtained for the Etheridge Group (Black & others, 1979), also applies to the Daniel Creek Formation.|
5263|Datson Member|Name source|From Mount Datson (140o23'E, 22o47'S) on Boulia 1:250 000 Sheet area.|
5263|Datson Member|Unit history|Generally equates with Unit 6 of Casey (1968). Laminated Dolomite Member of Jones et al. (1971) and Member(v) of Druce (1976).|
5263|Datson Member|Type section locality|Black Mountain (140o17'E, 22o32'S), the interval from 585 m to the top of the section within the Ninmaroo Formation from 246097 (140o16'00"E, 22o31'05"S) to 240101 (140o15'30"E, 22o31'00"S).|
5263|Datson Member|Extent|The unit is exposed in a 95 km belt from Mount Datson in the south to the Swift Hills in the north.|
5263|Datson Member|Thickness range|At least 200 m thick at Black Mountain; 295 m at Mount Datson; 62 m+ at Mt Ninmaroo.|
5263|Datson Member|Lithology|Thin to thick bedded limestone or dolostone (skeletal grainstone, boundstone, peloidal (pellet-like) grainstone, clast grainstone and lime mudstone (Dunham, 1962)). Characterised by dolomitisation and interlaminated cherts.|
5263|Datson Member|Relationships and boundaries|The Datson Member conformably overlies the Corrie Member. The unit is overlain by the Swift Formation which is in part, a weathering product of the Ninmaroo Formation. Field evidence suggests that in some places there is no break in the Ninmaroo-Swift sequence whereas in other places (Mt Ninmaroo) there is evidence of mild folding in the Ninmaroo Formation (Datson Member) but not in the Swift Formation. Dolomitization and silicification is characteristic of the unit.|
5263|Datson Member|Age reasons|The unit contains conodonts and trilobites which suggest an Early Ordovician (late Warendan to early ?Arenigian) age (Jones et al., 1971).|08/AUG/06

27080|Dead Horse Metabasalt|Name source|Dead Horse Creek which flows into the Gilbert River at GR 588834 (Bellfield 1:100 000 Sheet area).|
27080|Dead Horse Metabasalt|Unit history|Dead Horse Metabasalt Member (Withnall & Mackenzie, 1980).|
27080|Dead Horse Metabasalt|Geomorphic expression|The unit generally produces a subdued relief and has a characteristic reddish-brown tone on colour aerial photographs.|
27080|Dead Horse Metabasalt|Type section locality|The holostratotype of the Dead Horse Metabasalt, as defined by Withnall & Mackenzie (1980), is along an unnamed tributary of the Percy River between GR 632823 (bottom) and 633813 (top), prallel to the track between Iona homestead and Agate Creek a few hundred metres east of it. Most of the section consists of fine-grained, green, massive metabasalt, but the upper 200 m (approx.) contains well-preserved pillows, hyaloclastic breccias, and amygdales. Beds of grey-green phyllitic shale and siltstone up to 10 m thick occur in several parts of the section. Some coarser-grained basic rocks may be metadolerite sills or dykes.|
27080|Dead Horse Metabasalt|Description at type locality|Reference sections: The section exposed for about 1 km along the Percy River between GR 622796 (bottom) and 617802 (top) (Bellfield 1:100 000 Sheet area) is herein designated as a reference section (hypostratotype) for the Dead Horse Metabasalt. The section lies between the holostratotype of the Daniel Creek Formation and one of the parastratotypes of the Corbett Formation. It contains similar rocks to those in the holostratotype, but is better exposed. Fine-grained amphibolite containing relict amygdales and possible pillow structures and hyaloclastites is exposed in Bull Creek between GR 711149 and 711151 (Forsayth 1:100 000 Sheet area), about 700 m downstream of the Robin Hood-Middle Yard track. This section is designated as a hypostratotype for the more highly metamorphosed part of the Dead Horse Metabasalt.|
27080|Dead Horse Metabasalt|Extent|The Dead Horse Metabasalt is exposed in the northwestern quarter of the Gilberton 1:100 000 Sheet area, where it has a total area of approximately 80 km2. In the North Head 1:100 000 Sheet area, the unit crops out over about 150 km2 in a belt extending east from near South Head homestead to the Robertson River. Amphibolites, which are more highly metamorphosed equivalents of the metabasalt crop out in the Forsayth 1:100 000 Sheet area in a narrow sinuous belt extending north from Agate Pocket to the Robertson River and then northeast to the Newcastle Range.|
27080|Dead Horse Metabasalt|Thickness range|In the Gilberton and North Head areas the unit is 300 to 1000 m thick, but in the Georgetown area it has pinched out entirely and the Corbett Formation directly overlies the Daniel Creek Formation.|
27080|Dead Horse Metabasalt|Lithology|The Dead Horse Metabasalt consists of metabasalt and minor interbedded quartzite, siltstone and shale. The unit is metamorphosed mostly in the greenschist facies. The metabasalt is mostly massive, but pillows, amygdales, and hyaloclastic breccias occur in places. A weak schistosity is developed locally. However, to the east, in the Forsayth 1:100 000 Sheet area, where the rocks are of amphibolite facies, the unit consists of fine-grained, generally well-foliated amphibolite interlayered with schist.|
27080|Dead Horse Metabasalt|Relationships and boundaries|The Dead Horse Metabasalt conformably overlies the Daniel Creek Formation and is conformably overlain by the Corbett Formation. The Dead Horse Metabasalt is intruded by sills of Proterozoic Cobbold Metadolerite, and by the Siluro-Devonian Robin Hood Granodiorite and some late Palaeozoic hypabyssal rocks. It is unconformably overlain by the Devonian-Carboniferous Gilberton Formation and Jurassic Hampstead Sandstone.|
27080|Dead Horse Metabasalt|Identifying features|Withnall & Mackenzie (1980) defined the Dead Horse Metabasalt Member as part of the Robertson River Formation which has now been further subdivided and redefined as a subgroup. The Dead Horse Metabasalt Member is therefore redefined as a formation. The definition is basically as given by Withnall & Mackenzie (1980), but two reference sections are added, and some more highly metamorphosed metabasalts are included in the unit.|
27080|Dead Horse Metabasalt|Age reasons|The minimum age of 1570+/-20 Ma obtained for the Etheridge Group (Black & others, 1979), also applies to the Dead Horse Metabasalt.|

24242|Democrat Rhyolite Member|Name source|The name is derived from Democrat Creek, which joins Moonlight Creek at GR 7361-471824.|
24242|Democrat Rhyolite Member|Unit history|The Democrat Rhyolite Member was previously an undifferentiated part of the Croydon Volcanics (Branch, 1966); it was informally named 'Democrat rhyolite member' and described by Mackenzie (1983).|
24242|Democrat Rhyolite Member|Geomorphic expression|The area underlain by the unit has moderate to gentle relief, with some steep slopes and common bouldery outcrops. Vegetation cover is grasses and sparse trees; tone on airphotos is pale, but perhaps slightly less so than the Idalia Rhyolite.|
24242|Democrat Rhyolite Member|Type section locality|The type section extends from GR 7361-482823, near Democrat Creek (base; contact with Esmeralda Granite) to -494833 (top; gradational contact with paler grey, less altered and recrystallised Idalia Rhyolite) on the old Georgetown-Croydon road, and consists of about 30 m of dark bluish-grey, recrystallised, medium-grained, moderately crystal-rich rhyolitic ignimbrite. An informative reference section, which also includes rocks affected by low-temperature, late-stage alteration, is between -563727, 6 km east of Flanigans Gap, and -572740; it is about 60-70 m thick. A more accessible reference section, about 60 m thick and consisting of typical dark grey recrystallised ignimbrite with some late-stage alteration, is along the track east from Stanhills Battery, between 7361-581580 and 7461-594577.|
24242|Democrat Rhyolite Member|Extent|The unit extends in a belt about 1-2.5 km wide from 1 km north of the Gulf Developmental Highway near Laycocks Crek (7361-583579) southeastward to the White Hill area (-570800), then south of Nonda Creek at about 7461600505. A few small outliers, up to 1 km2, are exposed at the head of Ten Mile Creek (7361-568632), and near the southern end of the belt, northwest of Nonda Creek.|
24242|Democrat Rhyolite Member|Thickness range|The unit ranges in thickness from about 70 m in the central portion to about 30 m in the north and 20 m in the south.|
24242|Democrat Rhyolite Member|Lithology|The Democrat Rhyolite Member consists of medium to dark, greenish to bluish grey, moderately crystal-poor to rich rhyolitic ignimbrite, variably altered and/or recrystallised. The crystals, or crystal fragments, are 0.5 to 4 mm across: quartz is commonly bluish, purple, or violet; plagioclase is generally intensely sericitised; K-feldspar, mostly sanidine, is commonly overgrown by graphic quartz-K feldspar intergrowths; biotite (up to 3%) is chloritised. 'Spongy', inclusion-packed grains of garnet are present in trace amounts in all rocks, and graphite is ubiquitous.|
24242|Democrat Rhyolite Member|Relationships and boundaries|The Democrat Rhyolite Member is a member of the Idalia Rhyolite, but its (upper) boundary with the Idalia Rhyolite is diffuse and imprecisely defined. It was originally thought to be simply a contact-metamorphosed equivalent of the Idalia Rhyolite because of its relationship to the Esmeralda Granite, but petrographic studies have shown that it is slightly richer in chlorite (or biotite), garnet, and graphite than the Idalia Rhyolite. Its distribution, and fluid-inclusion evidence of hydrothermal fluids, suggest that it might also represent an altered carapace over the adjacent tin-mineralised zone in the Esmeralda and Nonda Granites with which it has an intrusive lower contact.|
24242|Democrat Rhyolite Member|Age reasons|Middle Proterozoic, as for Idalia Rhyolite.|

5474|Digger Creek Granite|Type section locality|In Digger Creek between GR 720 074 and 738 068 (Forsayth 1:100 000 Sheet area). Cream garnetiferous muscovite leucogranite and muscovite pegmatitic crop out.|
5474|Digger Creek Granite|Extent|Crops out in the following parts of the Forsayth and Gilberton 1:100 000 Sheet areas: (a) In the Robertson River catchment west of the Newcastle Range where it forms numerous small granite bodies and pegmatite dykes scattered throughout the Robertson River Metamorphics;  (b) An east-west belt of roof pendants in Robin Hood Granodiorite extending about 20 km west from near "Percyvale" Homestead;  (c) On the eastern side of the Newcastle Range near "Beverly Hills" Homestead;  (d) An area about 16 km south-southeast of "Beverly Hills" Homestead.  Other muscovite leucogranites in the Georgetown and Gilberton 1:100 000 Sheet areas may be related to the Digger Creek Granite.|
5474|Digger Creek Granite|Lithology|White, grey, and cream to pink varieties of aplitic to pegmatitic muscovite leucogranite; minor biotite, garnet locally present. Foliated in places. Pegmatite dykes common. Large bodies are mustly medium grained.|
5474|Digger Creek Granite|Relationships and boundaries|Intrusive into the Proterozoic Einasleigh Metamorphics, Robertson River Metamorphics, Oak River Granodiorite (new name), and possibly the Forsayth Granite. Intruded by the Siluro-Devonian Robin Hood Ganodiorite and late Palaeozoic rhyolite, andesite and dolerite dykes. Unconformably overlain by the Carboniferous Newcastle Range Volcanics and Jurassic-Cretaceous sandstone.|
5474|Digger Creek Granite|Age reasons|Proterozoic; K/Ar dating of a sample of muscovite from a pegmatite near "Robin Hood" Homestead gave a minimum age of 1120 million years (Richards et al., 1966). Recent dating of a sample from the type area by the Ar40/Ar39 incremental heating method indicated a minimum age of 1320 million years; the age obtained by total degassing was 1170 million years.|

27675|Dip Creek Limestone|Description at type locality|About 245 m of mainly bioclastic limestone crops out.REFERENCE SECTION::  Law (1985) studied a composite section to the southwest of the type section, and it is here designated as a reference section.  The section is from the base of the unit at 7859-680638 to 678627 (300 m), then 646606 in Atherton Creek to 648604 (350 m), and then 663613 to the top of the unit at 661614 (110 m).  The total thickness of the section is 760 m.  The unit consists mainly of bioclastic calcarenite, calcirudite, and lesser calcilutite (grainstone, packstone, and wackestone, with lesser mudstone).  Sandy and silty siliciclastic rocks are common in several intervals through the section.  See Withnall & others (1988, particularly figure 28) for more details.|
27675|Dip Creek Limestone|Extent|A folded belt of rocks extending 20 km from the headwaters of Shield Creek to Turtle Creek in the east.|
27675|Dip Creek Limestone|Thickness range|The total thickness of the reference section is 760 m.|
27675|Dip Creek Limestone|Lithology|Bioclastic limestone as in the reference section; sandy and silty siliciclastic rocks usually less well developed elsewhere.|
27675|Dip Creek Limestone|Fossils|The limestone contains a rich fauna of corals, and stromatoporoids, and less common brachiopods, bryozoans, gastropods, bivalves, ostracods, and conodonts.  It contains the lower two rugose coral faunas (Phillipsastrea and Sanidophyllum) recognised in the Chinaman Creek Limestone by Jell (in Wyatt & Jell, 1967).|
27675|Dip Creek Limestone|Relationships and boundaries|The unit is part of the Wando Vale Subgroup of the Broken River Group.  It conformably overlies a thin quartzose sandstone unit equated with the Tank Creek Sandstone.  The sandstone is probably absent in places and the Dip Creek Limestone lies disconformably on the Shield Creek Formation.  On the southern limb of the Atherton Anticlinorium  the Dip Creek Limestone is conformably overlain by a thin mudstone interval equated with the Papilio Mudstone.  Neither the Tank Creek Sandstone nor Papilio Mudstone is thick enough to map out at 1:100 000 scale in this area.  On the northern limb of the anticlinorium and in the Dip Creek Syncline, the Dip Creek Limestone is unconformably overlain by the Bulgeri Formation and in places by the Turrets Formation.  Its southern and northern limits are faults.  It is faulted against the Mytton Formation along the Lockup Well Fault, and against the Bulgeri Formation along the Shield Creek Fault.  Originally it may have been continuous with both the Chinaman Creek and Lockup Well Limestones.|
27675|Dip Creek Limestone|Age reasons|The age is middle Emsian to early Givetian.|

5547|Djuan Tonalite|Unit history|Cranfield and Schwarzbock (1974) applied this name to a tonalite that occurred adjacent to the Crow's Nest-Blackbutt Road.|
5547|Djuan Tonalite|Geomorphic expression|The unit occupies approximately 95 km2 in the nortwestern margin of ESK and forms a basinal area of undulating sparsely timbered, grazing country, generally between 390m and 420m in elevation.|
5547|Djuan Tonalite|Type section locality|Type locality along is along the Crow's Nest-Blackbutt Road from about AMG 40100 700400.  The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.|
5547|Djuan Tonalite|Extent|The unit occurs in the north-west corner of ESK and the north-east corner of OAKEY.|
5547|Djuan Tonalite|Lithology|The main part of the tonalite (PRgj) is grey to dark grey, distinctly xenolithic, and generally variable in grain size and modal composition.  Clots of ferromagnesian minerals commonly form dark patches.  The rock contains plagioclase, quartz, hornblende, biotite, and rarely potash feldspar and clinopyroxene. Accessory magnetite, sphene, apatite, and zircon are present; the major alteration products include sericite, laumontite, chlorite, epidote, iron oxide, and leucoxene.  The rocktypes of the xenoliths in the tonalite vary considerably; some are blocks of Sugarloaf Metamorphics (from fragments of wall rock broken off during intrusion of the tonalite); others are of igneous derivation.  The xenoliths are either round or elongate, and range from a few centimetres to large blocks up to 1 m in diameter.  Most of the xenoliths appear as dark patches of hornblende-rich material containing plagioclase phenocrysts.  The latter are sometimes rounded, or near the boundary of the xenolith is aligned subparallel to the general lineation of hornblende prisms.  Student work by Scott (1963) defined a well-developed platy flow foliation in the unit.  An overall trend of this foliation parallels the trend in the Sugarloaf Metamorphics.  Hornblende laths are strongly aligned resembling metamorphic amphibolites.  Quartz is only a very minor constituent of the rock.Unit Rgjh is characterised by a conspicuous zone of hornblende rich rocks, in the vicinity of the junction of Sandy Waterhole Creek and Emu Creek.Appinite bodies up to 1 km long and 100 m wide, and comprising 50 to 80 percent hornblende (1-10 mm long), occur along the margins of the tonalite.Foliation of the Djuan Tonalite is very prominent and parallels the schistosity of the Sugarloaf Metamorphics, except at the contact where a general east-west trend predominates. Further detailed lithology available in Cranfield et al (2001).|
5547|Djuan Tonalite|Relationships and boundaries|The Djuan Tonalite intrudes the Palaeozoic Sugarloaf Metamorphics and Maronghi Creek Beds.  The relationship to the Woolshed Mountain Granodiorite is poorly exposed; the units may be of similar age.  The Triassic Tarong beds and Tertiary Main Range Volcanics unconformably overlie the unit.|
5547|Djuan Tonalite|Age reasons|The K/Ar age of the Djuan Tonalite was quoted as 230 +/- 8 Ma by Cranfield & others (1976) and recalculated to 234.8+/-8 ie late Middle Triassic.  This age was collected from the eastern margin of the unit at AMG 401256 7007103.  Ar/Ar age dates from the unit indicate an older (Permian) age 258.5+/-0.9 (biotite) and 263.7+/-0.9 (hornblende) (Vasconceles & Feng, 2000) from AMG 398768 6999826 on the western margin of the intrusion. Based on the age variations in the unit it is grouped with the Permian to Triassic suite of intrusions in the Yarraman Sub Province.  The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.|

24246|Doherty Formation|Unit history|The Doherty Formation was previously mapped as part of the Corella Formation (Carter & others, 1961; Carter & Opik, 1963). However, it is geographically separated from the belt of Corella Formation containing the type section (in the Marraba 1;100 000 Sheet area), it is in contact with units which cannot be correlated with any confidence with those adjacent to the type section Corella Formation, and it is probably at least 40 m.y. younger than the type section Corella Format+B22ion (which is intruded by 1740 m.y. old granite).|
24246|Doherty Formation|Type section locality|Along the gorge of the Maramungee River from GR 874 186, 19 km NW of Answer Downs homestead, where calc-silicate breccia of the Doherty Formation is in contact with schist of the Soldiers Cap Group, west for 2.7 km to an outcrop of unnamed granite, which intrudes the formation, at GR 851181. There are continuous exposures of the predominant rock types of the formation - banded calc-silicate granofels and calc-silicate breccia, in about equal proportions - together with some intrusive metadolerite, along this gorge section.|
24246|Doherty Formation|Extent|The formation crops out in a N to NNW-trending belt up to 21 km wide extending from the eastern central part of the Selwyn 1:100 000 Sheet area (about 21o49'S, 140o56'E) northwards for over 100 km through the Mount Angelay 1:100 000 Sheet area and into the southern part of the Cloncurry 1:100 000 Sheet area, Duchess and Cloncurry 1:250 000 Sheet areas.|
24246|Doherty Formation|Thickness range|Probably several thousand metres, but uncertain because of tight folding and lack of facing evidence.|
24246|Doherty Formation|Lithology|The formation consists predominantly of thinly banded calc-silicate granofels and massive calc-silicate breccia which are variably calcareous, feldspathic, amphibolitic, scapolitic, and diopsidic. Minor rock types locally present include massive calc-silicate granofels, metarhyolite, metabasalt, banded quartz-tourmaline rock, mica schist, black slate, and variably calcareous feldspathic quartzite.|
24246|Doherty Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Contacts between the Foherty Formation and adjacent non-intrusive Precambrian units (Soldiers Cap Group, Kuridala Formation, Staveley Formation) are generally marked by faults and breccia zones, hence the stratigraphic relationships of the formation are uncertain. The formation may overlie the Soldiers Cap Group, either conformably or disconformably, may be similar in age to the Kuridala Formation, and may be older than the Staveley Formation (e.g. Blake & others, in prep. b). It is intruded by amphibolite, metadolerite, dolerite, and by granites of the Williams Batholith (Saxby, Mount Angelay, Squirrel Hills, Cowie, and Blackeye Granites, all new names, and unnamed granite), and is overlain unconformably by flat-lying Mesozoic sediments.|
24246|Doherty Formation|Age reasons|Proterozoic; in the Selwyn 1:100 000 Sheet area the formation includes metarhyolite, thought to be extrusive, which has been dated at about 1700 m.y. by the U-Pb method (R.W. Page, personal communication, 1980).|

24246|Doherty Formation|Comments|Remarks: The Doherty Formation has been regionally metamorphosed mainly to amphibolite grade, and is relatively resistant to erosion, forming hilly terrain throughout its outcrop area. It forms a mostly well-defined and mappable unit easily distinguished from adjacent stratigraphic units (though not always from irregular granitic intrusions).|

5619|Doomadgee Formation|Unit history|Included by Carter (1959) in the Wollogorang Formation, a name now restricted to an older formation in the Tawallah Group in the McArthur Basin. Roberts et al. (1963) included Doomadgee Formation in the Fickling Beds, which now become the Fickling Group.|
5619|Doomadgee Formation|Type section locality|180 m of sandstone, siltstone and dolomite exposed in a section 1 km northeast of Gorge Creek, in the southwestern Hedleys Creek Sheet area. The base of the section is at grid reference 878265, and the top is 1.6 km to the southeast, at grid reference 890214.|
5619|Doomadgee Formation|Extent|The unit is exposed over about 150 km2 in the southwestern part of the Hedleys Creek 1:100 000 Sheet area, Queensland (Sheet 6562) and the adjacent southeastgern part of the Seigal 1:100 000 Sheet area, Northern Territory (6462). The unit extends southward into the northeast corner of the Cleanskin 1:100 000 Sheet area, Northern Territory.|
5619|Doomadgee Formation|Thickness range|From 180 m at the type section, to over 400 m in the southern Seigal Sheet area.|
5619|Doomadgee Formation|Lithology|The formation includes conglomerate, sandstone, siltstone, shale and dolomitic rocks. The conglomerate occurs as lenses at the base of the unit, and contain pebbles and cobbles of underlying units, particularly chert and dolomite from the Walford Dolomite. A prominent finely laminated siltstone and black shale member is present in the middle of the formation. Above the member thin bedded manganese-stained fine sandstone is interbedded with dolomite. A prominent lens of conglomerate contains dolomite intraclasts and green clasts or flakes of clay or siltstone.|
5619|Doomadgee Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Disconformable on Mount Les Siltstone and Walford Dolomite. The contact is marked by pebbly sandstone and conglomerate lenses. The formation is overlain disconformably in the east, and with angular unconformity in the west, by Constance Sandstone.|
5619|Doomadgee Formation|Age reasons|Proterozoic-Carpentarian. Correlation of part of the underlying Peters Creek Volcanics with the Hobblechain Rhyolite Member of the Masterton Formation in the McArthur Basin suggest an age of less than 1575 m.y. (age of the Hobblechain Rhyolite Member). Younger age limit provided by 1280 m.y. old dolerites which intrude equivalents of the South :Nicholson Group. which unconformably overlies Mount Les Siltstone.|

23555|Dosey Limestone|Unit history|The Dosey Limestone was previously mapped as part of the Broken River Formation (now Group) (White, 1959, 1962, 1965) (parts of 'F', 'G', 'H', and 'I' lenses of White (1965)).  The name was first published and described by Withnall & others (1988), but was not formally defined.|
23555|Dosey Limestone|Geomorphic expression|Generally forms low ridges of limestone outcrops and rubble, and locally low bluffs with karst features.|
23555|Dosey Limestone|Type section locality|Lomandra Creek, between 7858-608410 (boundary with Storm Hill Sandstone) and 608410 (boundary with Papilio Mudstone).  The section is 230 m thick, and is part of section SD170 of Mawson & Talent (in press).REFERENCE SECTION::  Broken River between 7859-610442 (boundary with the Burges Formation) and 609443 (boundary with the Papilio Mudstone).  The section is 55 m thick and consists mainly of calcarenite and calcirudite (Withnall & others, 1988, figure 30).|
23555|Dosey Limestone|Description at type locality|The lowermost 100 m is composed of calcarenite, calcirudite, and calcilutite, which are represented by interbedded packstone, wackestone, and mudstone.  The middle part (120 m) is much coarser-grained and consists of thin to very thick-bedded calcarenite and calcirudite (mostly packstone and wackestone with some grainstone).  The uppermost 110 m is mainly cross-bedded sandy limestone and calcareous sandstone.  See Withnall & others (1988, figure 28 and pages 69-70) for more details.|
23555|Dosey Limestone|Extent|.  Intricately folded with other units in the Broken River Group, from 7859-634461 to the headwaters of Dosey Creek and Spanner Hill at 7858-520360.  The grid references are based on the AGD66 datum.|
23555|Dosey Limestone|Thickness range|Up to 250 m.|
23555|Dosey Limestone|Lithology|Mainly bioclastic limestone (calcirudite, calcarenite, and  calcilutite, represented by packstone and wackestone with lesser grainstone, mudstone, and boundstone).  Lesser sandy limestone and calcareous sandstone, locally with pebbles and cobbles of limestone.|
23555|Dosey Limestone|Fossils|The limestone contains a rich fauna of stromatoporoids dominated by Amphipora and lesser lamellar and hemispherical types.  Corals, crinoid ossicles, brachiopods, and minor gastropods, ostracods, conodonts, algae, and fish remains also occur.  The Sanidophyllum fauna of the Chinaman Creek Limestone (Wyatt & Jell, 1967) is present.|19/MAR/08
23555|Dosey Limestone|Relationships and boundaries|The Dosey Limestone is part of the Wando Vale Subgroup of the Broken River Group.  It conformably overlies the Storm Hill Sandstone, and where the latter is absent it lies directly on the Lomandra Limestone.  The presence of Amphipora packstones distinguishes it from the Lomandra Limestone.  Along the Broken River, it passes laterally  into and partly overlies the Burges Formation.  It is overlain by the Papilio Mudstone.|19/MAR/08

24253|Double Crossing Metamorphics|Type section locality|From a point 1.3 km E of the Answer Mine east for 2.5 km to GR 377032, Mount Merlin 1:100 000 Sheet area, Duchess 1:250 000 Sheet area. This section traverses undulating terrain formed of Double Crossing Metamorphics from a concordant, possibly faulted, contact with phyllite and fine-schist of the Answer Slate to the W to a similar contact with fine-grained mica schist and schistose meta-arenite of the Staveley Formation to the E. Medium to coarse schist, gneiss, migmatite, feldspathic quartzite, amphibolite and abundant concordant to cross-cutting granite veins are exposed in the type section.|
24253|Double Crossing Metamorphics|Thickness range|Unknown, because of tight folding and because no stratigraphic sequences have been determined within unit, but probably at least 1000 m.|
24253|Double Crossing Metamorphics|Lithology|Rock types present are micaceous and felsic gneiss and schist, migmatitic gneiss with leucosome 'sweats', amphibolite, quartzite, banded quartz-hematite and quartz-tourmaline rocks, meta-arkose, and many concordant to cross-cutting veins and veinlets of pegmatite, leucogranite, and quartz.|
24253|Double Crossing Metamorphics|Relationships and boundaries|Intruded by and intemately associated with Gin Creek Granite; its relationships to adjacent Answer Slate and Stavely Formation are uncertain - it may be exposed in the core of an anticline, in which case it is probably partly overlain unconformably by, and partly faulted against, these two formations.|
24253|Double Crossing Metamorphics|Age reasons|Proterozoic; the unit may be part of the Early Proterozoic basement of the Mount Isa Inlier.|

5776|Dugald River Shale Member|Name source|The Dugald River Shale Member is named after the Dugald River lead-zinc prospect which occurs in the unit. The prospect lies 19 km northwest of Quamby and 2.5 km west of Dugald River, in the Quamby 1:100 000 Sheet area.|
5776|Dugald River Shale Member|Unit history|The Dugald River Shale Member has been previously mapped as part of the Corella Formation (Carter & others, 1961; Wilson & others, 1979b). Whitcher (1975) referred to it as the Dugald River Shale and Connor & others (1982) termed it the Dugald Slates.|
5776|Dugald River Shale Member|Geomorphic expression|The Dugald River Shale Member forms a persistent rounded strike ridge which rises a few tens of metres above the surrounding calc-silicate rocks and dolomitic limestone.The gossanous zones are characterised by a total absence of eucalypt trees and spinifex but are covered with a poor growth of 'copper grass' Tephrosia (Cole, 1980).|
5776|Dugald River Shale Member|Type section locality|The type section is defined in the vicinity of the Dugald River lead-zinc prospect, in a small east-flowing tributary of Dugald River from latitude 20o15'24"S, longitude 140o9'23"E (GR 119598) to latitude 20o15'24"S, longitude 140o9'10"E (GR 115598). The exposed sequence in the type section of the Dugald River Shale Member is, from east to west: approximately 25 m of black laminated shale, a gossanous sequence approximately 20 m thick, 140 m of blacl laminated shale containing minor zones of gossanous shale and slate, and 70 m of spotted schist.|
5776|Dugald River Shale Member|Extent|The unit is exposed in two areas. The main area is a narrow north-trending belt near the middle of the Quamby 1:100 000 Sheet area, centred approximately on the Dugald River lead-zinc prospect, and the other area is a small outcrop west of the Lady Clayre mine approximately 4 km southwest of the main area. The total area of outcrop is 2 km2.|
5776|Dugald River Shale Member|Thickness range|At the surface the thickness of the unit ranges from about 60 m in the north to about 500 m in the south. At depth the unit htins to about 35 m (Connor & others, 1982).|
5776|Dugald River Shale Member|Lithology|In addition to the rock types noted in the type section, grey to black pyritic/pyrrhotitic shale, cordierite (?), and andalusite(?), spotted schist, and calcareous siltstone occur and are more common in the south of the main area of exposure. The area near the Lady Clayre mine consists of grey spotted schist, pyritic shale, and andalusite(?) slate. Thin highly potassic tyff or fine-grained volcaniclastic beds and siltstone containing casts or pseudomorphs of the evaporite minerals shortite and gypsum have been reported in the Dugald River Shale Member by Connor & others (1982). The mineralised horizons contain pyrrhotite, pyrite, sphalerite, and galena in graphitic slate and a quartz-carbonate gangue (Connor & others, 1982). At depth the shale is mostly graphitic. Primary sedimentary structures and soft-sediment deformation structures are particularly evident in drill core.|
5776|Dugald River Shale Member|Relationships and boundaries|The Dugald River Shale lMember overlies a dolomitic limestone (the footwall limestone) which is in the upper most third of the Corella Formation. The basal contact is a transition over less than 1 m from grey to green laminated or brecciated calc-silicate rocks to dark grey to black (carbonaceous) shale, and is taken as the top of the highest band of calc-silicate rocks. In places, the member is faulted against older calc-silicate rocks of the Corella Formation. The member is overlain, apparently conformably, by a poorly exposed sequence of calc-silicate rocks, siltstone, shale, and schist which is regarded as the uppermost part of the Corella Formation in this area. This sequence is disconformably overlain by the Knapdale Quartzite (Connor & others, 1982).|
5776|Dugald River Shale Member|Structure and Metamorphism|The Dugald River Shale Member in the main outcrop area dips west at 50o to 80o and predominantly youngs to the west, although isoclinal folding and a large-scale fold axis have been recognised in the south of this area. The sequence in the Lady Clayre mine area is tightly to isoclinally folded. Metamorphic grade is probably of low to middle greenschist facies. Cordierite(?) and andalusite(?) were reported by Whitcher (1975), but the recent identification of evaporite minerals introduces some doubt as to the existence of these metamorphic minerals (Connor & others, 1982).|
5776|Dugald River Shale Member|Age reasons|The Dugald River Shale Member is regarded as part of the upper Corella Formation, which overlies the 1760 Ma Argylla Formation and is intruded by the 1740 Ma Burstall Granite (Page, 1981).|
5776|Dugald River Shale Member|Proposed publication|Queensland Government Mining Journal|
5776|Dugald River Shale Member|Comments|Discussion: The Dugald River Shale Member is regarded as a lacustrine deposit in a non-marine restricted clastic sedimentary basin (Connor & others, 1982). Minor volcanic input is evidenced by the tuffaceous beds. The enclosed ore bodies are typical stratiform black shale hosted lead-zinc deposits. The reserves are 60 Mt of ore containing 10 percent zinc, 1 percent lead, and 30 g/t silver, extending to a depth of 1000 m (Connor & others, 1982). Whitcher (1975) correlated the Dugald River Shale Member with the Mount Isa Group but more recent geochronological data (Page, 1981) indicated it is probably older.|
5886|Dynamite Creek Member|Name source|Dynamite Creek, a tributary of Gunpowder Creek, in the south of MYALLY (1:100 000 Sheet areas indicated by capitals).|
5886|Dynamite Creek Member|Unit history|The Dynamite Creek Member was not distinguished from the Eastern Creek Volcanics by Carter & others (1961) and was hown as an unnamed member (Pheq) of the volcanics on the Alsace 1:100 000 Geological Series preliminary map.|
5886|Dynamite Creek Member|Geomorphic expression|The unit commonly occurs as cuestas with the gentler western dip slope contrasting with the steep eastern slope.|
5886|Dynamite Creek Member|Type section locality|The holostratotype of the Dynamite Creek Member is defined as a section about 800 m long at the base of a low ridge in the north bank of Dynamite Creek in MYALLY from 6859-585458 (base) to 6859579456 (top). The section, approximately 9 km south of Alsace Camp on Gunpowder Creek, comprises approximately 100 m of conglomerate overlain by 50 m of feldspathic and labile sandstone. The conglomerate contains rounded clasts of granite and acid volcanics up to 60 cm in diameter, and some smaller clasts of quartzite and vein quartz. The conglomerate fines upward.|
5886|Dynamite Creek Member|Extent|A discontinuous north-trending linear belt extending for 25 km from 5 km south of Mistake Creek in ALSACE to 5 km north of Dynamite Creek in MYALLY. The areas of outcrop in each of these sheet areas total 5 km2 and 6 km2, respectively.|
5886|Dynamite Creek Member|Thickness range|The Dynamite Creek Member is thickest in the south, where it is at least 200 m thick and may be as thick as 350 m (Derrick & Wilson, 1982). North of the type section (where it is 150 m thick) it thins rapidly and is only about 1 m thick in the most northerly outcrops.|
5886|Dynamite Creek Member|Lithology|Conglomerate is best developed within 2 km of the type section, but pebbly conglomerate containing acid volcanic and quartzite clasts occurs at the base and as thin lenses within the member in most sequences. Labile sandstone containing acid volcanic and shale fragments and feldspathic sandstone are the other main rock types; minor siltstone is interbedded with sandstone. In the north, the member contains a basal pinkish brown medium-grained pebbly feldspathic sandstone with siltstone interbeds, overlain by brown laminated fine-grained labile sandstone and buff slightly feldspathic sandstone.|
5886|Dynamite Creek Member|Relationships and boundaries|The Dynamite Creek Member overlies the Ewen Granite unconformably and is overlain conformably by metabasalt flows of the Cromwell Metabasalt Member of the Eastern Creek Volcanics (Wilson & Grimes, in press). The basal unconformity is clearly evident at 6859-588498, 4 km north of the type section. The first appearance of sedimentary rocks above the Ewen Granite defines the base of the Dynamite Creek Member. The upper boundary is defined by the base of the first basaltic lava flow in the overlying member. The unit is intruded by dolerite dykes.|
5886|Dynamite Creek Member|Structure and Metamorphism|The Dynamite Creek Member is a shallow west-dipping unit which is locally faulted. Metamorphic effects are not evident in the sedimentary rocks, but the overlying metabasalt contains low greenschist facies mineral assemblages.|
5886|Dynamite Creek Member|Age reasons|The Dynamite Creek Member is younger than the Ewen Granite which has been dated by U-Pb zircon techniques as 1840+/-50 Ma (Page & others, 1982). The unit must also be younger than the Bottletree Formation (Blake & others, 1981) which unconformably underlies the Eastern Creek Volcanics to the south of Mount Isa and has yielded U-Pb zircon dates of 1790+/-9 and 1808+/-20 Ma (Page & others, 1982). Minimum ages for the Dynamite Creek Member are provided by U-Pb zircon dates on the Sybella Granite which intrudes the Eastern Creek Volcanics (1670 to 1710? Ma; Page & others, 1982), and on the Carters Bore Rhyolite (1678+/-1 Ma; Page, 1978) which occurs at a higher stratigraphic level than the Eastern Creek Volcanics to the west of Mount Isa. A minimum age of 1740 Ma can be inferred from the Burstall Ganite (Page, 1981) which intrudes the Corella Formation, a correlative of the Qulalar Formation (Derrick & others, 1980) which overlies the Eastern Creek Volcanics. From these data, the Dynamite Creek Member is probably between approximately 1800 Ma and 1740 Ma old.|
5886|Dynamite Creek Member|Proposed publication|Queensland Government Mining Journal|
5886|Dynamite Creek Member|Comments|Discussion: Some of the rocks mapped as Lena Quartzite Member of the Eastern Creek Volcanics in the southern half of ALSACE probably correlate with the Dynamite Creek Member. The Dynamite Creek Member is in a similar stratigraphic position to the Mount Guide and Leander Quartzites (Derrick & others, 1976) which underlie the Cromwell Metabasalt Member conformably to the southeast and north-northwest of Mount Isa. The Dynamite Creek Member probably formed in a fluvial environment along the western edge of the elevated Ewen Block during the infilling of the Mount Isa fault trough (Glikson and others, 1976; Derrick, 1982, fig. 4).|
5887|Dyraaba Member|Name source|Parish of Dyraaba, County of Lyndhurst (Clarke River 1:250 000 Cadastral map).|
5887|Dyraaba Member|Unit history|Previously mapped as part of the Bundock Creek Formation (now Group) by White (1959, 1962, 1965) and 'upper' Bundock Creek Formation by Wyatt & Jell (1980).  The name was first published and described by Withnall & others (1988), but not formally defined.|
5887|Dyraaba Member|Geomorphic expression|Low hilly topography which is strongly dissected and gullied.  It is covered by low scrub, eucalypts, and is well grassed in places.|
5887|Dyraaba Member|Type section locality|In a tributary of Mount Brown Creek between 7859 499462 (base) and 497466 (top).   The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.|
5887|Dyraaba Member|Description at type locality|It is 385 m thick, and consists of fine to medium-grained, micaceous, feldspathic to lithofeldspathic, muddy sandstone, siltstone, and mudstone.  The base of the member is placed at the bottom of a medium to thick-bedded, medium to very coarse-grained, calcareous, micaceous sandstone which overlies a thick mudstone unit in the Teddy Mount Formation.  Numerous fossil logs and stems litter the surface above the boundary.  The upper half of the unit is generally finer grained, but it coarsens again towards the top.|
5887|Dyraaba Member|Extent|As presently mapped, it is confined to the Boroston Syncline in the headwaters of Mount Brown Creek and its tributaries, but similar lithologies have been noted elsewhere in the Teddy Mount Formation.|
5887|Dyraaba Member|Thickness range|385 m in the type section, but the thickness elsewhere is difficult to determine because of folding|
5887|Dyraaba Member|Fossils|Abundant lepidodendroid and calamitean plant remains occur throughout the unit, and suggest a Late Devonian or Early Carboniferous age.  Rare disarticulated brachiopods also occur, but are not diagnostic.|
5887|Dyraaba Member|Relationships and boundaries|Forms the upper part of the Teddy Mount Formation, and is distinguished by being more sandy, and containing abundant plant remains.  It is conformably overlain by the Boroston Formation, and is distinguished from it by the lack of quartz-rich sandstone and the presence of abundant plant remains.  It is intruded by the Carboniferous or ?Permian Montgomery Range Igneous Complex.|
5887|Dyraaba Member|Age reasons|The lepidendroid and calamitean plant remains throughout the unit, suggest a Late devonian or Early Carboniferous age.  The unit is possibly early Tournaisian, in view of the conodont ages lower in the Teddy Mount Formation.|

30138|Eridge Member|Lithology|The Eridge Member consists predominantly of lithic-rich dacitic to rhyolitic volcaniclastics. The member has been divided into four informal units (Cte1, Cte2, Cte3, Cte4) as in the type section These units have been separated largely on colour and spatial distribution:- Cte1-  is the lowest unit of the Eridge Member and consists mainly of light green to green, crystal-poor to moderately crystal-rich, moderately lithic-rich rhyolitic ignimbrite. Grey, moderately crystal-rich to crystal-rich rhyolitic ignimbrite, moderately lithic and moderately crystal-rich rhyolitic and dacitic tuff, rhyolitic lapilli breccia, spherulitic rhyolite, flow-banded rhyolite and minor fossiliferous volcaniclastic siltstone are also present.

The uppermost unit (Cte4) - consists of dark purple, dacitic breccia, crystal-poor, lithic-rich dacitic ignimbrite and mottled green and maroon, dacitic lapilli breccia.|07/FEB/11
30138|Eridge Member|Relationships and boundaries|The Eridge Member is part of the Tareela Volcanics. Lepidodendron veltheimianum was found in the unit Cte1 at 8159-157687 in a volcaniclastic siltstone and suggests an Early Carboniferous age. The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.|
6279|Esmeralda Granite|Name source|Esmeralda Homestead, 79 km south-southeast of Croydon at GR 7460-655144.|
6279|Esmeralda Granite|Type section locality|The type locality as designated by White (1959) is on the Croydon-Esmeralda road, 3 km north of Esmeralda homestead (GR 7560-666175); there, the unit consists of grey, massive, coarse-grained biotite granite with scarce pegmatitic pods and lenses, and rare xenoliths of graphite and graphitic metasediments. Reference locality:  Turkey Knob Hill, alongside the Gulf Developmental Road about 13 km southeast of Croydon (GR 7361-423817) is a prominent tor made up of grey coarse-grained biotite granite, typical of the Esmeralda Granite as redefined.|
6279|Esmeralda Granite|Extent|The Esmeralda Granite crops out along the western margin of the Croydon Volcanic Group as an elongate batholith with a northwesterly trending axis. The total area of exposure is about 850 km2 in central and southeastern CROYDON, western ESMERALDA and a small part of the southwestern corner of GILBERT RIVER. The batholith probably extends to the west under Mesozoic and younger sedimentary cover.|
6279|Esmeralda Granite|Lithology|Grey, massive, medium to coarse,-even-grained to slightly porphyritic (muscovite-) biotite granite. Locally, at or near the roof of the pluton, especially in the Croydon area, it contains graphite and/or graphitic metasedimentary enclaves; greisenisation is widespread in the Mount Cassiterite-Stanhills area.|
6279|Esmeralda Granite|Relationships and boundaries|The Esmeralda Granite intrudes the Idalia Rhyolite (including the Democrat Rhyolite Member) and Carron Rhyolite and probably also Parrot Camp Rhyolite and B Creek Rhyolite, of the Proterozoic Croydon Volcanic Group. It is unconformably overlain by the Jurassic Hampstead Sandstone and Loth Formation, and the Jurassic-Cretaceous Gilbert River Formation. The Nonda Granite is considered to be a fine-grained marginal variant of the Esmeralda Granite, or perhaps a slightly earlier, genetically related, intrusive phase; however, no unequivocal contact relationships have been observed.|
6279|Esmeralda Granite|Identifying features|The Esmeralda Granite was originally defined by White (1959), and described by Branch (1966), as a medium-grained, grey biotite adamellite grading into granodiorite, which forms a batholith on the western side of the Croydon Volcanic Group and various-sized stocks east-northeast of Croydon and along the eastern margin of the volcanics. Field mapping by a joint Bureau of Mineral Resources-Geological Survey of Queensland party in 1980 showed that the plutons in the east, although similar in most respects to the Esmeralda Granite are sufficiently different and geographically separated to be excluded from it and assigned to the following new units: Mooremount Granite, Chadshunt Granite, Macartneys Granite, Olsens Granite, Dregger Granite, Illewanna Granite, Bimba Granite and Awring Granodiorite. The Nonda Granite, another new unit, is considered to be a marginal variant of the Esmeralda Granite. The name Esmeralda Granite is therefore restricted to the medium to coarse-grained biotite granite constituting the bulk of the largest exposed pluton on the western margin of the volcanics, and including the original type area (White, 1959).|
6279|Esmeralda Granite|Age reasons|The Esmeralda Granite is mid-Proterozoic; it has a Rb-Sr muscovite age of 1444 Ma* (Black, 1973).          *Corrected using the 87Rb decay constant of 1.42x10-11 yr-1 recommended by Steiger & Jager (1977).|

6282|Esperanza Formation|Name source|Esperanza mine, 500 m west of Mammoth mine at 280215 in the Mammoth Mines 1:100 000 Sheet area.|
6282|Esperanza Formation|Type section locality|Holostratotype: On the southern side of Gunpowder Creek, approximately 10 km downstream from its junction with Paradise Creek and approximately 2 km west of Esperanza mine, between 260200 (base) and 263200 (top) in the Mammoth Mines 1:100 000 Sheet area. The lower boundary of the Esperanza Formation in the type section is placed at the base of the lowermost stromatolitic chert. The upper boundary is placed at the top of a stromatolitic chert which is overlain by a ferruginous breccia included in the Lady Loretta Formation. Hypostratotype: The best exposed section of Esperanza Formation along Paradise Creek between 135170 and 108190 in the Mammoth Mines 1:100 000 Sheet area, is defined as the hypostratotype. Here three bands of massive cherts containing contiguous domal stromatolite bioherms, and "organ pipe" (Conophyton) stromatolites are interbedded with fine grained dolomitic sandstone, siltstone and minor quartzite. The overlying Lady Loretta Fromation is not exposed in this section.|
6282|Esperanza Formation|Extent|It is recognised around the Kamarga Dome in the Lawn Hill 1:100 000 Sheet area; in the cores of anticlines and synclines in the Lawn Hill and Riversleigh 1:100 000 Sheet areas; in a narrow belt along the western side of the Mount Oxide and Memmoth Mines 1:100 000 Sheet areas; and in fault bounded blocks in the Mammoth Mines, Kennedy Gap and Yelvertoft 1:100 000 Sheet areas.|

25899|Ethabuka Sandstone|Name source|The name Ethabuka Sandstone is derived from Ethabuka Holding, 170 km southwest of Boulia on the western side of the Mount Whelan and Bedourie 1:250 000 Sheet areas.|
25899|Ethabuka Sandstone|Unit history|The unit was first recognised as unit OM-11 by Pritchard (1960), and as an unnamed Middle Ordovician sandstone by Smith, Vine & Milligan (1961). However, Reynolds (1964; in Smith, 1965) included all sandstones overlying the Mithaka Formation, in the Siluro-Devonian Cravens Peak Beds. Alliance Oil Development N.L. (1975) recognised the "Ethabuka Beds" in AOD Ethabuka No. 1. The Ethabuka Sandstone was then recognised in outcrop, and referred to as "unnamed sandstone unit" (Shergold, Druce, Radke & Draper, 1976). The Cravens Peak Beds of Reynolds  contains three distinct units (Draper, 1976; Draper, Jones & Turner, in preparation): the Middle Ordovician Ethabuka Sandstone, the Devonian Cravens Peak Beds (sensu stricto), and a post-Devonian valley fill conglomeratic unit. The unit referred to by Harrison (1979) as the Ethabuka Beds is the Ethabuka Sandstone.|
25899|Ethabuka Sandstone|Type section locality|The type section (holostratotype) is in AOD Ethabuka No. 1 (23o41'20"S; 138o25'30"E) (Alliance Oil Development, 1975). The base of the sequence is at 1202 m where sandstones overlie the shales of the Mithaka Formation. The upper boundary occurs at 55 m where the unit is unconformably overlain by the Jurassic Hooray Sandstone. This upper boundary has been the subject of some conjecture in the past. Alliance Oil Development (1975) fixed the top of the "Ethabuka Beds" at 1024 m despite the fact that in Appendix 1 they report the presence of probable Ordovician fossils at the top of an interval they assign to the Devonian Cravens Peak Beds. Harrison (1978), on the basis of seismic records, on velocity grounds, and the flat lying nature of the thin Mesozoic sequence at outcrop, placed virtually all of the rocks above 1202 m in the "Ethabuka Beds" except for the top 30 m which he assigns to the Cretaceous. This latter view is accepted here in principle although the Mesozoic boundary is lowered slightly (to 55 m). The boundary is taken at the change to more poorly sorted sandstone and from mottled clay into unmottled clay from the Ethabuka Sandstone into the Hooray Sandstone which contains possible plant remains. The seaction comprises a basal 244 m of very fine to fine sandstone with siltstone interbeds and rare pebbly layers; the siltstone is more common in the upper part of this sequence. Overlying this is a 875 m thick sequence of fine to medium grained sandstone. The upper 28 m comprises fine to medium grained sandstone interbedded with claystone. Samples of cuttings from AOD Ethabuka No. 1 are held by the Bureau of Mineral Resources and the Geological Survey of Queensland. The reference section (hypostratotype) is on a low ridge 100 m east of Toomba Bore (latitude 23o05'S, longitude 137o59'E) on Hay River 1:250 000 Sheet area, Northern Territory. It comprises 36 m of medium bedded, very fine to fine grained, sublabile sandstone containing clay pellets. Lamination, cross lamination and parting lineation are present. The base of the unit is obscured by alluvium. The upper contact is an unconformity with sandstones of the Devonian Cravens Peak Beds (Draper, jones & Turner, in preparation).  Reference localities. The basal contact of the unit can be seen at the top of the scarp 1.5 km southeast of PAP Netting Fence No. 1. Other useful outcrops of the basal part of the unit can be seen at Lake Amaroo (23o30'S; 138o40'E) on Mount Whelan 1:250 000 Sheet area. A stratigraphically higher portion of the unit, not present in the reference section, crops out at only one locality (22o58'S; 138o07'E on Glenormiston 1:250 000 Sheet area) as three small mesas and one slight rise. The rocks consist of weathered sandstone containing numerous biogenic structures. The contact with the overlying Cravens Peak Beds is obscured. Access is difficult with no permanent tracks in the area.|
25899|Ethabuka Sandstone|Extent|The Ethabuka Sandstone crops out poorly along the inner margin of the Toko Syncline and is present on the Mount Whelan, Glenormiston and Hay River 1:250 000 Sheet areas. The unit is present in the subsurface in AOD Ethabuka No. 1.|
25899|Ethabuka Sandstone|Thickness range|The maximum thickness observed in outcrop is 35 m, but 1147 m are present in AOD Ethabuka No. 1.|
25899|Ethabuka Sandstone|Lithology|In outcrop, the Ethabuka Sandstone comprises very fine to fine-grained quartzose to sublabile sandstone, with some mudstone and siltstone interbeds. Clay pellets are present in some beds, and are occasionally present as thin clay pellet conglomerates. Friable, fine-grained sandstone with minor phosphate pellet conglomerate is present above the quartzose to sublabile sandstone. Bedding in the quartzose to sublabile sandstone is mainly thin to medium with minor thick bedding and flaser bedding. Bedding in the friable sandstone is thick to massive. The middle and upper portions of the type section are not present in outcrop.|
25899|Ethabuka Sandstone|Fossils|In the lower part, pelecypods are the dominant fauna, but trilobites and nautiloids are present. In the upper part of the un;it the fossils occur as fragments, and comprise pelecypods, gastropods and linguloid brachiopods. The fauna has not yet been described although Fleming (in Alliance Oil Development, 1975) made a tentative identification of several fossils from AOD Ethabuka No. 1 and suggested an Ordovician age for the fauna.|
25899|Ethabuka Sandstone|Relationships and boundaries|The un;it conformably overlies the Methaka Formation and is unconformably overlain by Devonian Cravens Peak Beds, or Mesozoic rocks where Cravens Peak Beds are absent, as is the situation in the vicinity of AOD Ethabuka No. 1.|
25899|Ethabuka Sandstone|Structure and Metamorphism|Inorganic sedimentary structures present in outcrop in the quartzose to sublabile sandstone include: cross lamination, lamination, asymmetric, linguoid and interference ripplemarks, load casts, parting and streaming lineation, flute marks, brush marks, gouge marks, current crescents and sand shadows. Biogenic sedimentary structures include Cruziana, tracks and trails, walking traces, Rusophycus and rare burrows. The friable sandstone is extensively bioturbated; Cruziana is common, whereas U-tubes and various other burrows are less common.|
25899|Ethabuka Sandstone|Age reasons|Superpositional evidence suggests a middle Ordovician age; this is supproted by the presence of probable Ordovician fossils in AOD Ethabuka No. 1.|
25899|Ethabuka Sandstone|Name first published by|Harrison P.L., 1979|
6300|Etheridge Group|Unit history|The name "Etheridge Formation" was applied by White (1965) to the Candlow, Heliman and Townley Formations, and part of the Robertson River Formation. See Introduction.|
6300|Etheridge Group|Constituents|The Etheridge Group consists of, from top to bottom: Langdon River Formation; Candlow Formation; Heliman Formation; Townley Formation; Robertson River/Bernecker Creek Formation Einasleigh Metamorphics.|
6300|Etheridge Group|Type section locality|A composite of the type sections of all the component stratigraphic units as defined separately.|
6300|Etheridge Group|Extent|The Etheridge Group includes rocks that crop out over much of the Georgetown Inlier. It extends from the Langdon River valley east to the Newcastle Range, northeast to the Maureen area and past "Dagworth" homestead across the Einasleigh River, and southeast through the Gilberton-upper Gilbert River area to the Werrington-Lyndhust area where it is bounded by the Burdekin Fault Zone and the Balcooma Mylonite Zone. From the upper Gilbert River area, the Group is discontinuously exposed along the eastern side of the Newcastle Range northward almost to the Einasleigh River; it is bounded to the east by the Tertiary McBride basaltic province and the Balcooma Mylonite Zone. North of the Einasleigh River, Precambrian rocks in the Dargalong Inlier, the McDevitt and Dargalong Metamorphics, may be equivalent to the Robertson River Formation and Einasleigh Metamorphics. South of the upper Gilbert River area, isolated outliers of Precambrian rocks in the area from the Woolgar goldfield to Chasm Creek and the Cape River area, and an area of metamorphics in the Gregory Springs-Clarke Hills area may also be equivalent to part of the Etheridge Group.|
6300|Etheridge Group|Thickness range|Difficult to estimate because of the variability of thickness of the component units, their complex folding, and the non-exposure of the bases of the lowermost units. Langdon River Siltstone 800 to 1400m.  Candlow Formation 1000 to 3500 m. Heliman Formation 800 to 1500 m. Townley Formation 400 to 1500 m. Robertson River Formation/Bernecker Creek Formation/Einasleigh Metamorphics at least 3000 m.    =  6000 to 11000 m.|
6300|Etheridge Group|Lithology|Phyllite, slate, mica schist, mica-feldspar-quartz gneiss, quartzite, calc-silicate rocks, metabasalt, metadolerite, metagabbro, amphibolite, migmatite; cleaved to phyllitic sericitic or quartz-lithic siltstone to fine sandstone; variably ferruginous and/or carbonaceous siltstone, fine sandstone, and rare shale; quartzose siltstone and fine sandstone; dark grey siliceous siltstone and fine sandstone.|
6300|Etheridge Group|Relationships and boundaries|The base of the Group, as presently known, is not exposed. The top is defined by marked angular unconformity at the base of the Malacura Formation, which contains detritus derived from the Etheridge Group. Intruded by a wide variety of Proterozoic granitic rocks, including the Forsayth granitic suite, and by a variety of Late Palaeozoic igneous rocks. Partly overlain (unconformably) by late Palaeozoic acid volcanics (Newcastle Range, Maureen, Dismal Creek and Cumberland Range Volcanics) and sandstones of the late Mesozoic Eulo Queen Group and Gilbert River Formation.|
6300|Etheridge Group|Identifying features|White (1965) divided the Precambrian metasedimentary rocks of the Georgetown Inlier between the Newcastle Range (Newcastle Range Volcanics) and the Gregory Range (Croydon Volcanics) into three units: Robertson River Metamorphics, Etheridge Formation, and Langdon River Formation. Work by BMR-GSQ field parties during 1977 and 1978 has shown that the upper three-quarters of White's "Etheridge Formation" can be divided into three units, the Candlow, Heliman, and Townley Formations. The lower part of the "Etheridge Formation" grades into and is inseparable from White's "Robertson River Metamorphics"; accordingly, these rocks have been grouped together and redefined as Robertson River Formation. Conformably underlying, and perhaps in part transitional into the Robertson River Formation is the Bernecker Creek Formation. This calcareous unit can be traced, with increasing metamorphic grade, into the Einasleigh Metamorphics where it either underlies or overlies (facings are not yet resolved) metapelitic rocks that may be equivalent to (part of?) the Robertson River Formation. In places, where calc-silicate metamorphics are absent, pelitic schists/gneisses of the Einasleigh Metamorphics grade into Robertson River Formation. Thus it is proposed to upgrade "Etheridge Formation" to Etheridge Group and include in it all rocks of the previous "Formation", along with all contiguous and lithologically related units above and below. The Group therefore includes all rocks between the unconformity at the top of the Langdon River Siltstone and the (unknown) base of the Einasleigh Metamorphics.|
6300|Etheridge Group|Age reasons|Probably Middle Proterozoic. A minimum age of 1570+/-30 m.y. has been obtained from dating of the earliest deformation-metamorphism event in the Einasleigh Metamorphics (Black et al., in press). The Forsayth Granite, which intrudes the Group, is dated at about 1600 m.y. (L.P. Black, pers. comm., 1978).|
6400|Eva Creek Microgranite|Name source|Eva Creek which rises in the eastern Newcastle Range and joins McMillan Creek at grid ref. 119796 (Georgetown 1:100 000 Sheet area).|
6400|Eva Creek Microgranite|Unit history|Branch (1966) and Bain et al. (1975) assigned the rocks to the Elizabeth Creek Granite. A new unit is defined because of (1) the spatial separation of the Eva Creek Microgranite and type Elizabeth Creek Granite and consequent uncertainty as to their temporal and genetic relationships, (2) the fact that microgranite is only a minor component of the Elizabeth Creek Granite as currently defined, and (3) possible future re-study and revision of the Elizabeth Creek Granite.|
6400|Eva Creek Microgranite|Type section locality|Bush track from the left hand branch of Eva Creek at grid ref. 157749 (Georgetown 1:100 000 Sheet area) to abandoned tin miner's camp at grid ref. 130759 (Georgetown 1:100 000 Sheet area). Rocks cropping out in this area are mainly grey and pink, buff-weathering, porphyritic microgranite with minor biotite and hornblende; the rocks weather to rounded boulders and tors. Grey quartz-rich greisen dykes and quartz veins with cassiterite and minor molybdenite, chalcopyrite and galena cut the microgranite locally. The microgranite is commonly chloritized adjacent to such dykes and veins.|
6400|Eva Creek Microgranite|Extent|A roughly rectangular area of 11 km2 in the northern part of the eastern Newcastle Range about 40 km east of Georgetown.|
6400|Eva Creek Microgranite|Lithology|Mainly grey and pink porphyritic microgranite with 10 to 50 percent quartz and feldspar phenocrysts, and up to 5 percent biotite and hornblende phenocrysts. Feldspar phenocrysts are perthite and subsidiary plagioclase (oligoclase-andesine). Subsidiary fine grained porphyritic granite, grey quartz-rich greisen. Minor chloritized microgranite, pink aplite.|
6400|Eva Creek Microgranite|Relationships and boundaries|Intrudes and has locally metamorphosed volcanic and sedimentary rocks in the eastern sequence of the Newcastle Range Volcanics.|
6400|Eva Creek Microgranite|Age reasons|Probably Late Palaeozoic. The Newcastle Range Volcanics in the eastern part of the range are probably Carboniferous, like those in the main range. The Eva Creek Microgranite is lithologically similar to some varieties of the Late Palaeozoic Elizabeth Creek Granite; mineralisation is similar to that in the Elizabeth Creek Granite.|
25903|Fahey Range Andesite|Name source|FAHEY RANGE; grid reference 785768, Caboolture 1:100 000 Sheet area (9443).|
25903|Fahey Range Andesite|Type section locality|(250 m to 275 m) of andesitic volcanics exposed over a horizontal distance of 405 m along Cedar Creek (a tributary of the South Pine River) from grid references 778778 (bottom) to 781776 (top of section), Caboolture 1:100 000 Sheet area (9443). The base is identified by a grey to dark grey andesitic agglomerate 45 m thick which is overlain by very fine-grained andesite, andesite (porphyritic), and andesitic agglomerate flows dipping at 40o to 60o to the northeast. The top is identified by a very fine-grained hornfelsed andesite, 14 m thick.|
25903|Fahey Range Andesite|Extent|The unit crops out over approximately 3 km2 from Mount D'Aguilar 781794 to Mount Glorious 778768, Caboolture 1:100 000 Sheet area (9443).|
25903|Fahey Range Andesite|Thickness range|250 m to 275 m within type section.|
25903|Fahey Range Andesite|Lithology|Andesitic agglomerate, grey to dark grey, very fine-grained groundmass containing fragments of andesite and minor argillaceous material to 23 cms in diameter. Andesite, dark grey, very fine-grained groundmass, porphyritic, euhedral phenocrysts of plagioclase to 5 mm in diameter. Very fine-grained andesite, dark grey, aphanitic. Total absence of plagioclase phenocrysts. Hornfelsed by contact metamorphism with Mount Samson Granodiorite (Phillips, 1964).|
25903|Fahey Range Andesite|Relationships and boundaries|The unit unconformably overlies the Devonian to Carboniferous Nerangleigh-Fernvale Beds and was intruded by the Triassic Mount Samson Granodiorite which has been dated at 217 million years by the potassium-argon method (Cranfield, et al., in prep.). The base and top of the section are the contacts of the andesitic volcanics with the diorite and microdiorite phases of the Mount Samson Granodiorite.|

This section comprises 85 m of vesicular mafic volcanics overlain by 160 m of rhyolitic agglomerate. A quartz feldspar porphyry band may be intrusive or extrusive.|
6639|Fiery Creek Volcanics|Extent|Best developed in the Gregory Downs and the northern part of the Mount Oxide 1:100 000 Sheet areas; in a continuous belt along the western margin of the Myally 1:100 000 Sheet area; and discontinuously in the Mammoth Mines and Alsace 1:100 000 Sheet areas.|
6639|Fiery Creek Volcanics|Thickness range|The unit is 250 m thick in the type section. Elsewhere the thickness varies considerably.|
6639|Fiery Creek Volcanics|Lithology|Massive rhyolite agglomerate is the main lithology in the Gregory Downs and northern part of the Mount Oxide 1:100 000 Sheet areas. Throughout the rest of the outcrop area, the unit comprises flow banded rhyolite, ferruginous sandstone, and vesicular mafic volcanics in varying proportions. Massive rhyolite domes occur in the northeastern part of the Mount Oxide 1:100 000 Sheet area.|
6639|Fiery Creek Volcanics|Relationships and boundaries|The unit is overlain with slight angular unconformity by sandstone of the Surprise Creek Formation. It rests conformably on the Bigie Formation and where this is not present, it rests unconformably on the Quilalar Formation or Myally Sub Group.|
6639|Fiery Creek Volcanics|Age reasons|Mid Proterozoic (Carpentarian). It is equivalent to the Carters Bore Rhyolite which has been dated at 1678 m.y. (Page 1978).|

6827|Forsayth Granite|Name source|Forsayth township situated 40 km south of Georgetown at longitude 143o36'E, latitude 18o35'S, Georgetown 1:250 000 Sheet area.|
6827|Forsayth Granite|Unit history|White (1959, 1965) included, in the Forsayth Granite, rocks which are now assigned to the Oak River Granodiorite, Digger Creek Granite, White Springs Granodiorite, Mistletoe Granite, Lighthouse Granite and Talbot Creek Granodiorite. The Forsayth Granite is thus redefined to exclude these units and to restrict the name to Middle? Proterozoic granitic rocks in the type area and their correlatives to the north and west as discussed above. Bain et al. (1975) used the name "Forsayth Complex" synonomously because of the impossibility of mapping the numerous varieties at 1:100 000 scale; the original name is retained however, so as to conform with the nomenclatural style used for the other granitic rock units in the region.|
6827|Forsayth Granite|Type section locality|Main Georgetown-Forsayth road between the two townships, excluding areas of Robertson River Metamorphics and Cobbold Dolerite. Rocks exposed in the type area are mainly grey melanocratic to leucocratic, equigranular to porphyritic, biotite granite with minor local muscovite; the rocks are commonly foliated.|
6827|Forsayth Granite|Extent|Two main araeas: (1) 375 km2 centred on Forsayth and extending from the Ropewalk Range north to Talbot Creek, (2) 500 km2 extending from near Telegraph Creek, 3 km east of Georgetown, 30 km west to Somerset Creek, north to within 3 km of "Ironhurst" homestead, and south to the Mount Sullivan area. Numerous small bodies and apophyses surround the two main areas, extending as far north as the Yataga Granodiorite; there are none east of the Newcastle Range. Rocks tentatively correlated with the Forsayth Granite occur in the Cumberland Range area about 8 km north of "Green Hills" outstation.|
6827|Forsayth Granite|Lithology|Grey, locally pink, leucocratic to melanocratic biotite granite with minor muscovite (mainly secondary) locally. The granite is equigranular to porphyritic, the latter variety having feldspar megacrysts 2 to 7 cm long, and is commonly foliated; grey, locally foliated, muscovite-biotite leucogranite which is equigranular to porphyritic (feldspar megacrysts up to 2 cm long); minor dark grey biotite microtonalite. Some varieties of muscovite-biotite granite cropping out in the Cumberland Mine area west of Georgetown (Forest Home 1:100 000 Sheet area) but absent from the type area are included in the unit because of their close spatial relationships to and/or gradational contacts with muscovite-biotite granite in the type area.|
6827|Forsayth Granite|Relationships and boundaries|Intrudes Robertson River Metamorphics, Cobbold Dolerite and probably Einasleigh Metamorphics; contact metamorphic effects are slight. The Forsayth granite is intruded by the Digger Creek Granite; relationships with other Proterozoic granites are not known with certainty, although it is believed that the Forsayth Granite is younger than the Mistletoe and Lighthouse Granites.|
6827|Forsayth Granite|Age reasons|Probably Middle Proterozoic. Preliminary isotope data suggest an age of about 1500 million years (L.P. Black, pers. Comm.).|

27288|Furry Hoop Member|Name source|Furry Hoop Creek, a tributary of the Clarke River.|
27288|Furry Hoop Member|Unit history|Previously part of the Clarke River Formation (now Group) (White, 1959).|
27288|Furry Hoop Member|Type section locality|The holostratotype of the Furry Hoop Member (approximately 320 m thick) is located between GR 960516 (base) and 951515 (top). Most of the section consists of fine-grained, red-green, micaceous sandstone/siltstone with rare conglomerate intervals. These features combined with the abundance of carbonate material in these rocks distinguish the member from the rest of the Lyall Formation.|
27288|Furry Hoop Member|Extent|The member has been mapped in the centre of the Clarke Rivr Basin, mainly around a domal structure north of the junction of the Clarke River with Keppel Creek South, and extending northeast in a thin belt for about 12 km. The member is likely to be represented elsewhere in the basin, but has not yet been mapped out.|
27288|Furry Hoop Member|Thickness range|In the type section the unit is approximately 320 m thick, but elsewhere it ranges from 100 to 150 m (in the west of the basin) to 260 to 320 m (in the east), and thins to the north.|
27288|Furry Hoop Member|Lithology|The rock types range from shale to coarse-grained sandstone to conglomerate, tuff and limestone. The rocks are characteristically red or green. The coarser sandstones contain small-scale cross-stratification, scour-and-fill structures and channel development. In contrast, the very fine-grained sandstones and siltstones, although well laminated, have few other sedimentary structures. Sporadic deposits of bimodal conglomerate contain jasper, argillite, quartz, quartzite and acid volcanic fragments in a coarse volcanolithic matrix. Jasper occurs in the member in several forms apart from pebbles in conglomerate; namely, as massive bands and as jasper fragments/sinuous bodies in calcareous, volcanolithic sandstone.|
27288|Furry Hoop Member|Relationships and boundaries|The Furry Hoop Member is part of the Lyall Formation, and locally directly overlies the Venetia Formation (with probable disconformity), which is distinguished by the lack of acid volcanic components and the absence of the red-green colour typical of the Furry Hoop Member; elsewhere it is underlain by other sedimentary rocks of the Lyall Formation (mainly volcanolithic sandstone and conglomerate). The Furry Hoop Member is characterised by relatively flat, low relief. It crops out poorly and is covered by a veneer of alluvium in much of the area.|
27288|Furry Hoop Member|Age reasons|Late Visean (Jell & Playford, in press).|

24282|Garden Creek Porphyry|Unit history|Previously mapped as Kalkadoon Granite (e.g. Carter & Opik, 1963), which pre-dates the Mount Guide Quartzite.|
24282|Garden Creek Porphyry|Type section locality|5.5 km NE of Dajarra, at GR 503039, Dajarra 1:100 000 Sheet area. Here the Garden Creek Porphyry, consisting of porphyritic microgranite, is exposed mainly as small spheroidal boulders on a low ridge, flanked by narrow depressions developed on poorly exposed amphibolitic metadolerite, between higher strike ridges of Mount Guide Quartzite to the east and west.|
24282|Garden Creek Porphyry|Extent|Forms N-trending band up to 250 m wide within the range of Mount Guide Quartzite N of Dajarra; extends for 37 km from GR 501035, NW Dajarra 1:100 000 Sheet area, to GR 516407, SW Duchess 1:100 000 Sheet area, Duchess 1:250 000 Sheet area.|

7050|Gatton Sandstone|Name source|The name is derived from the township of Gatton in the Laidley Valley, Ipswich 1:250 000 Sheet area, Queensland.|
7050|Gatton Sandstone|Unit history|The unit was originally named Gatton Sandstone Member by McTaggart (1963).  Although the 'Blaxland Fossil Wood Conglomerate Member' of McElroy (1962) was never adequately defined it is evident that it is equivalent to the Gatton Sandstone. Although McElroy's (1962) unit name has priority, we prefer to use Gatton Sandstone because - 1. it has gained wide acceptance and is entrenched in the literature, particularly in Queensland where the Marburg Subgroup is well documented; 2) the term 'Blaxland Fossil Wood Conglomerate Member' has not been widely used or accepted, and is commonly used in a variety of ways and we prefer to avoid further confusion by redefining the formation, and retaining the name Gatton Sandstone.|03/DEC/09
7050|Gatton Sandstone|Constituents|The Calamia Member constitutes a thin unit at the base of the Gatton Sandstone and the Koreelah Conglomerate Member composes the base of the Gatton Sandstone where the formation overlaps basement rocks. A prominent thin unit near the base of the Gatton Sandstone is characterised by the abundance of large fossil wood fragments, commonly ferruginised, in a coarse grained, conglomeratic sandstone matrix. The beds occur in outcrop along the western and southern flanks of the basin and are best exposed in road cuttings on the Gwydir Highway, Bruxner Highway and on the Copmanhurst-Jackadgery road (GR MN 697.317; Grafton 1:100 000 Sheet). The thickness of this unit is estimated in the range 5 to 10 m and contains blocks and logs of fossil wood up to 20 m long and nearly 1 m in diameter. Further study of these beds may show that they constitute an important marker bed near the base of the Gatton Sandstone and deserve formal status. However definition and naming of this unit should wait until it can be shown that it forms a continuous member in the formation.|
7050|Gatton Sandstone|Geomorphic expression|Mostly rounded hillslopes of low relief. No characteristic topographic features.|
7050|Gatton Sandstone|Type section locality|McTaggart (1963) did not give a type section for the Gatton Sandstone Member but Gray (1975) nominated GSQ Ipswich 18 over the interval 1368.1' (417.07 m) to 2955.0' (900.7 m) as the reference section and it is here designated as the type section.|03/DEC/09
7050|Gatton Sandstone|Description at type locality|The lithological succession and thickness in the type section is shown in GSQ Ipswich 18 drill log attached. (Fig. 11). The principal rock types in the type section are - Sandstone - quartz-lithic to lithic, cross-bedded, medium to very coarse grained in multistorey fining up sequences, interspersed clasts, in white silty matrix; carbonaceous laminae, pebbly at channel bases, mostly poorly sorted and bedded, subangular, in part feldspathic, occasional volcanic clasts and coal spars, clay pellets, in part finely micaceous, parallel laminated, cross-laminated and ripple cross-laminated, common fossil wood fragments.  Conglomerate - pebble and cobble, mostly at base of channel sands, clasts of jasper, quartzites, volcanics metasediments; very coarse grained quartzose/quartz/lithic/feldspathic matrix.  Siltstone/shale - dark grey to black, wavy irregular bedding, possible relict soil intervals, thin interlaminae of siltstone, in part bioturbated, occasional load casts.  Coal - very thin laminae in siltstone.|
7050|Gatton Sandstone|Extent|The formation is present basin wide in the Marburg Subgroup.|
7050|Gatton Sandstone|Lithology|The lithology of the formation varies little throughout the basin except where it overlaps the Palaeozoic basement rocks in the west. Here the formation is much coarser grained and contains beds of conglomerate and grades downwards into thick conglomerate. This conglomerate is formally defined in this paper as the Koreelah Conglomerate Member of the Gatton Sandstone. The upper boundary of the Gatton Sandstone is marked by the change from uniform quartz-lithic and lithic-sandstone to a variable sequence of quartzose and quartz lithic sandstone, siltstone, shale and some coal of the overlying Koukandowie Formation. The lower boundary is delineated by a change in sandstone composition to clean quartz sandstone of the Ripley Road sandstone, and in places either by the base of the locally developed Koreelah Conglomerate Member, or the Calamia Member.|03/DEC/09
7050|Gatton Sandstone|Depositional environment|Predominantly low sinuosity fluvial deposits in high energy environments.|
7050|Gatton Sandstone|Fossils|Fossils include wood fragments, plant remains and spores, pollen grains, and sporadic acritarchs.|
7050|Gatton Sandstone|Diastems or hiatuses|Minor diastems and hiatusus are present in the formation but no major depositional breaks are recorded.|
7050|Gatton Sandstone|Relationships and boundaries|Upper and lower contacts are apparently conformable, except where the formation overlaps Palaeozoic basement in which case the lower boundary is an angular unconformity. A regional unconformity separates the Gatton Sandstone from the Raceview Formation of the Woogaroo Subgroup in the southeast at the Coast and Dirty Creek Ranges.|03/DEC/09
7050|Gatton Sandstone|Identifying features|The stratigraphic position and lithology of the sequence are the main distinguishing features. The sandstone in the formation is predominantly very coarse grained, poorly sorted, quartz-lithic and lithic sandstone in channel sand bodies and minor overbank deposits. The formation commonly contains fossil wood.|
7050|Gatton Sandstone|Age reasons|The formation is basal Early Jurassic in age and includes elements of palynostratigraphic assemblages C and D (de Jersey, 1976; McKellar, 1981b) and unit J1 of Evans (1963, 1966). Palynofloras of assemblage D collected from the upper part of the formation indicate a Toarcian age (McKellar, 1974; Helby et al. 1987) equivalent to assemblages from the immediate pre-oolitic ironstone sequence of the Ma Ma Creek Member (McKellar, 1981).|

23611|Gem Park Granite|Geomorphic expression|The granite forms terrain of low to moderate relief and is poorly exposed. On Landsat 5 TM 1-4-7 (BGR) images, the Gem Park Granite is represented by cleared areas with a yellow-orange hue. On geophysical images, magnetic response is low; the K counts are moderate-high, Th counts are generally moderate, and U counts are usually moderate to high.|06/MAR/08
23611|Gem Park Granite|Type section locality|At 8450-596978, 4.9 km southeast of Silver Hills homestead. The outcrop consists of foliated, cream to pink, fine to coarse-grained garnet-muscovite-biotite granite.  The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.|18/MAR/08
23611|Gem Park Granite|Description at type locality|The outcrop consists of foliated, cream to pink, fine to coarse-grained garnet-muscovite-biotite granite.|
23611|Gem Park Granite|Extent|The Gem Park Granite crops out as elongate bodies in a south-southeast trending belt between Rubyvale and the Capricorn Highway. The two largest bodies are south of Retreat Creek, and are up to 8 km long by 2 km wide, separated by a narrow belt of Bathampton Metamorphics. Other areas assigned to the Gem Park Granite, partly for convenience, are smaller narrow, linear bodies up to 4 km long, intruding the metamorphic rocks farther north near Rubyvale and Reward.|
23611|Gem Park Granite|Lithology|Cream to pink and grey, strongly foliated and locally mylonitised, muscovite and muscovite-biotite granite.  The easternmost of the two main bodies is the most strongly deformed, particularly along its western contact, where a zone of intense foliation and mylonitisation up to 400 m wide is developed.  The bodies in the Rubyvale-Reward area are mostly strongly foliated two-mica granite and commonly have a strong, shallowly plunging stretching lineation.|06/MAR/08
23611|Gem Park Granite|Relationships and boundaries|Contacts between the Gem Park Granite and the Anakie Metamorphic Group are complex. Increasingly abundant screens of metamorphic rocks in the granite pass out into metamorphic rocks that contain abundant dykes and veins of leucogranite and pegmatite.  The Gem Park Granite is intruded by components of the Retreat Batholith, including the Mount Newsome Granodiorite, Whitdale Granodiorite, Keilambete Tonalite and unassigned granodiorite bodies. The Late Devonian to Early Carboniferous Silver Hills Volcanics and sedimentary rocks of the Drummond Basin unconformably overlie the Gem Park Granite.|07/FEB/11
23611|Gem Park Granite|Age reasons|The age is uncertain, but may be Cambrian. The strong foliation in the smaller bodies is parallel to that in the adjacent Anakie Metamorphic Group, suggesting that the two units were deformed together. The age of the deformation and metamorphism is probably Cambrian (Withnall & others, 1993). The Gem Park Granite is S-type and was possibly generated during the metamorphism.|

7245|Gin Creek Granite|Name source|Named after Gin Creek, a tributary of the Mort River, and Gin Creek Bore (at GR 378988), Mount Merlin 1:100 000 Sheet area, Duchess 1:250 000 Sheet area. Gin Creek and its tributaries drain much of the outcrop area of the unit.|
7245|Gin Creek Granite|Unit history|Named Gin Creek Granite and briefly described in an unpublished report by White (BMR Record 1957/94), and referred to as Gin Creek Granite by Brooks (1960). Like all other granites in the eastern part of the Duchess 1:250 000 Sheet area, it was mapped as Williams Granite by Carter & Opik (1963).|
7245|Gin Creek Granite|Type section locality|Low hilly country 4 km NE of Gin Creek Bore, in vicinity of GR 412022. The three main granitic types making up the unit are exposed in this area: mainly foliated xenolithic biotite granite and fine-grained to pegmatitic leucogranite in the western part, and mainly non-foliated biotite granite containing feldspar phenocrysts up to 5 cm across in the eastern part.|
7245|Gin Creek Granite|Extent|Restricted to E part of Mount Merlin 1:100 000 Sheet area. Main outcrop, 24 km long (N to S) and up to 6 km wide, lies E of Gin Creek bore. A few small outcrops are present to the west.|
7245|Gin Creek Granite|Lithology|Main rock types exposed are medium to coarse-grained and locally porphyritic biotite granite, fine to coarse-grained, xenolithic, commonly porphyritic, weakly foliated to gneissic biotite granite (which predominates on the W and N sides of the main outcrop); and fine-grained to pegmatitic leucogranite containing tourmaline and muscovite. Minor fine-grained biotite granite, aplite and greisen are also present.|
7245|Gin Creek Granite|Relationships and boundaries|Gin Creek Granite intrudes Double Crossing Metamorphics (new name), Answer Slate, Staveley Formation, Kuridala Formation and metadolerite, and is overlain by flat-lying Mesozoic sediments. Tourmaline-muscovite granite locally cuts the other two main granitic types.|

24292|Goat Creek Andesite|Name source|The name is derived from Goat Creek, which joins Nannygoat Creek, a tributary of Pleasant Creek, at GR 7461-008798.|
24292|Goat Creek Andesite|Unit history|Goat Creek Andesite was previously part of the undivided "Croydon Volcanics" of Branch (1966); it was informally named 'Goat Creek andesite' and described by Mackenzie (1983).|
24292|Goat Creek Andesite|Geomorphic expression|The Goat Creek Andesite is characterised by very low to flat topography with sparse vegetation cover and dark brown to red-brown soil.|
24292|Goat Creek Andesite|Type section locality|The type section is along the "Tabletop"-Wallabadah outstation road, between GR 7362-396108 (base) and -395107 (top). The unit here consists of altered, amygdaloidal, sparsely porphyritic, fine-grained basaltic andesite at least 30 m, and possibly up to 100 m, thick. At its base is the poorly outcropping, white, deeply weathered Wallabadah Siltstone, and its top is marked by an abrupt transition into bouldery outcrops of massive rhyolitic ignimbrite assigned to the Parrot Camp Rhyolite, or to the Carron Rhyolite. This is the only reasonably accessible section; however, exposure is not good, and the unit is better exposed around GR 500115, on the southern side of a large inlier of volcanics near the Carron River, east of "Wallabadah" outstation. Rocks assigned to the Goat Creek Andesite are well exposed, though deeply weathered, about GR 7461-028792, between Pleasant and Nannygoat Creeks, but there is some doubt about the age of the mafic lavas in this area (see below).|
24292|Goat Creek Andesite|Extent|In the Croydon 1:100 000 Sheet area, the unit crops out discontinuously in an arc from near the Tabletop-Wallabadah road to the eastern border of the sheet area. Other small bodies, each less than 0.5 km2, crop out at GR 7361-537095, -502111, -513113 and -539137, in the area south and southwest of Round Hole Hut. In the Gilbert River 1:100 000 Sheet area, the unit crops out discontinuously over a wide area in the valleys of Goat, Nannygoat, Bullseye and Black Soil Creeks, around GR 7461-000780.|
24292|Goat Creek Andesite|Thickness range|In the type area, the unit is at least 30 m, and possibly up to 100 m thick; its thickness in the Pleasant Creek-Nannygoat Creek area is unknown.|
24292|Goat Creek Andesite|Lithology|The Goat Creek Andesite consists of variably amygdaloidal, sparsely plagioclase-phyric, basaltic andesite to andesite. It is intensely altered (spilitised), and the amygdales commonly contain agate, up to 5 cm in diameter.|
24292|Goat Creek Andesite|Relationships and boundaries|Goat Creek Andesite conformably overlies Wallabadah Siltstone, and is conformably or paraconformably overlain by B Creek Rhyolite or Carron Rhyolite in the type area and nearby areas. It is also unconformably overlain by Jurassic-Cretaceous Gilbert River Formation, Pliocene-Pleistocene Claraville Formation, and other Tertiary to Quaternary sediments in these areas. In the Pleasant Creek area, rocks assigned to the Goat Creek Andesite are apparently confined to fault-bounded depressions, faulted against B Creek, Carron and Idalia Rhyolites, and overlain by Permian Bullseye Rhyolite (Mackenzie, 1983); they are also unconformably overlain by Mesozoic Gilbert River Formation and Quaternary sediments. In parts of this area the mafic rocks appear to overlie the Croydon Volcanic Group, and, perhaps, the Inorunie Group, and may be, at least in part, equivalent to the Permian McFarlanes Andesite (Mackenzie, 1983). However, basaltic to andesitic rocks intersected in a drill hole at GR 7461-043759 (J. Fawckner, pers. comm., 1982) are petrographically and chemically unlike the McFarlanes Andesite (Mackenzie, in prep, and are petrographically similar to Goat Creek Andesite in the Wallabadah-Carron River area, and to andesitic rocks in the B Creek Rhyolite.|
24292|Goat Creek Andesite|Age reasons|In the type area the unit is of Middle Proterozoic age, as for the remainder of the Croydon Volcanic Group. However, some of the basaltic to andesitic rocks in the Nannygoat Creek-Pleasant Creek area assigned to the Goat Creek Andesite by Mackenzie & others (1981, 1983) and Mackenzie (1983) are probably Permian. More field and laboratory data would be required to properly resolve this issue.|

24295|Gongora Granodiorite|Name source|Parish of Gongora, County of Lang, within whicha rea the pluton is exposed.|
24295|Gongora Granodiorite|Unit history|Tentatively assigned by Branch (1966) to the Prestwood Microgranite, although Branch states that this is only per airphoto-interpretation, and the intrusion could be (to paraphrase Branch) an outlier of the Forsayth Batholith.|
24295|Gongora Granodiorite|Geomorphic expression|The otherwise very subdued topography of the pluton is dominated by its capping of Hempstead Sandstone, which is intricately dissected to form a shape like a hand with fingers spread.|
24295|Gongora Granodiorite|Type section locality|The northern-northwestern end of the pluton, near the major eastern branch of Stockyard Creek (about GR 7560-365400).|
24295|Gongora Granodiorite|Extent|The Gongora pluton is elliptical, or, more accurately, egg-shaped, with the ends of the long axis at GR 7560-377409 and -380317, and the ends of the short axis at -349360 and -407360. The area of the pluton is about 175 km2.|
24295|Gongora Granodiorite|Lithology|Medium to coarse-grained biotite granodiorite with abundant deep yellow-brown biotite and semi-poikilitic orthoclase and quartz; complexly twinned and strongly zoned plagioclase. Porphyritic to strongly porphyritic in places near margins.|

24300|Gowers Formation|Name source|Gowers Bore, a water bore on Thorntonia Station, GR 825381; Undilla 1:100 000 topographic sheet. Latitude 19o33'S Longitude 138o50'E.|
24300|Gowers Formation|Unit history|Opik (1979) assigned these rocks to the basal Currant Bush Limestone de Keyser & Cook (1972) placed some of these rocks in an informal unit, the Chummy Bore Formation.|
24300|Gowers Formation|Type section locality|6.3 m of bituminous limestone and phosphatic limestone, with minor dolostone toward the base. Chert nodules common in the lower 4 m of section. Outcrop occurs on the northern side of the toe of a prominent east-west ridge of terraced limestone; GR 813368, Undilla 1:100 000 topographic sheet. The section commences at a small tree-covered sinkhole located some 300 m due west of the SSW-SW kink in the access track that follows the fence SSW from Gowers Bore. The base is marked by a 20-40 cm thick phosphatic dolostone that disconformably overlies a 2-10 cm thick horizon of limonite stained stromatolites, named the Bronco Stromatolith Bed. The top consists of a 1 m thick sequence of cream-brown laminated limestone.|
24300|Gowers Formation|Extent|The Formation crops out to the south of Gowers Bore along West Thornton Creek for a distance of 8 km. Traced to the west of Gowers Bore the Formation crops out over a northwest trending arc to Plumtree Bore, a distance of 13 km.|
24300|Gowers Formation|Thickness range|0-15 + metres. Formation is wedge-shaped thinning to the southwest and thickening westwards. Formation is absent to the south of Beantree Bore.|
24300|Gowers Formation|Lithology|Medium olive grey, bituminous limestone, phosphatic limestone, minor phosphorite and chert are the dominant lithologies east of Chummy Bore. Light grey, vuggy and recrystallised dolostone and phosphatic dolostone are the dominant lithologies west of Chummy Bore. Phosphatic hardgrounds and phoscrete crusts are locally abundant.|
24300|Gowers Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Disconformably overlies the Bronco Stromatolith Bed, a unit of limonite-stained stromatolites and phoscrete crusts that caps the Thorntonia Limestone. Along West Thornton Creek the Gowers Formation is disconformably overlain by the non-phosphatic Currant Bush Limestone. West of Plumtree Bore, the upper contact is unknown.|
24300|Gowers Formation|Age reasons|An abundant and well preserved fauna that includes agnostoid and polymeroid trilobites, inarticulate and articulate brachiopods, molluscs and hyolithes. Jell (1975) and Opik (1979) place these rocks in the Euagnostus opimus zone which assigns them to the Floran Stage of the Middle Cambrian. Fauna includes Criotypus lemniscatus, Euagnostus opimus Onymagnostus (Agnostonymus semiermis), Rhodotypiscus nasonis, Triplagnostus diremptus (Opik, 1979). Many fossils are preserved as phosphatic internal moulds. Molluscs from this Formation are described by Runnegar & Jell (1976).|
27083|Graveyard Creek Group|Name source|Graveyard Creek, which joins Gray Creek at 7859-686690.  The creek branches at 669696 and most topographic maps show Graveyard Creek as the east-flowing branch.  According to local usage the south-flowing branch is Graveyard Creek, and the other branch is Chinaman Creek.|
27083|Graveyard Creek Group|Unit history|Graveyard Creek Formation of White (1959, 1962, 1965), which was raised to group status by Withnall & others (1988).|

The larger, in which the Quinton Formation and Crooked Creek Conglomerate crop out, extends from 'Pandanus Creek' homestead east to Tomcat Creek, and from the middle reaches of Dinner Creek south to the large laterite plateau in the central part of BURGES.  The other area is a southwest-trending belt about 25 km long and 6 km wide from the southern edge of the plateau in the headwaters of Back Creek to the Dosey Creek area.  The Poley Cow and Jack Formations crop out in this area.|
27083|Graveyard Creek Group|Lithology|Lithofeldspathic to lithic (and locally quartzose) arenite, polymictic conglomerate, mudstone, and limestone.|
27083|Graveyard Creek Group|Fossils|The Group contains a diverse fauna which includes graptolites, trilobites, corals and conodonts, and indicates an Early Silurian to earliest Devonian age.  See Withnall & others (1988)  for more details.|

7781|Gregory Downs Limestone|Name source|Gregory Downs' property; GR 198940y - Lawn Hill 1:250 000 Sheet area.|
7781|Gregory Downs Limestone|Type section locality|The poor outcrop and flat lying nature of the unit prevents the description of a measured section. The type locality is the bed and banks of Macadam Creek where it is crossed by the road from Gregory Downs to Lawn Hill (GR 191940y - Lawn Hill 1:250 000 Sheet area). The outcrop at the type area has been described and illustrated in Grimes (1974). Here 5 m of limestone are exposed and the upper boundary is marked by the junction with the overlying dark clay of the Armraynald Beds. The lower boundary is not exposed at the type locality.|
7781|Gregory Downs Limestone|Extent|Scattered outcrops occur in creek beds and across the black soil plains to the NW, W, and SW of Gregory Downs Homestead. It is also recorded in drillholes to the N and NE, making a total areal extent of about 500 km2.|
7781|Gregory Downs Limestone|Thickness range|Up to 5 m in outcrops, a maximum of 12 m in water bore R 30163, 5 km SW of the type locality. The thickness is very variable and the limestone pinches out completely in some places.|
7781|Gregory Downs Limestone|Lithology|In outcrops the formation comprises white massive or thick-bedded fine to coarsely crystalline limestone with small pale green clay shards in some beds. There are some thin beds of soft white or yellow calcareous and sandy clay, and of pink calcarenite. Veins and nodules of chert occur within the limestone. Thin sections exhibit both sparry calcite and cloudy micrite with a scattering of quartz grains (Grimes, 1974; Cox, 1973).|
7781|Gregory Downs Limestone|Relationships and boundaries|The limestone underlies the dominantly clayey Armraynald Beds at the type locality and in the bore holes. The lower boundary of the unit is less well defined. The base is not exposed at the type locality and in the nearest borehole (IWSC Gregory Downs No. 1 - Cox, 1973) the limestone appears to have pinched out. However in the next bore to the east (IWSC Gregory Downs No. 2, 4 km from the type area) there is a bed of "soft weathered limestone" between 9 and 12 m depth which underlies the clay and gravel beds of the Armraynald Beds and overlies gravel and clay of the Floraville Formation. The depth of 12 m in this borehole is taken as the base of the Gregory Downs Limestone. The Floraville Formation in this area has limestone bands interbedded with its dominantly clay, sand and gravel lithologies. These limestone bands should not be confused with the overlying thick limestone of the Gregory Downs Limestone.|

25038|Gunpowder Creek Formation|Name source|Gunpowder Creek which joins the Leichhardt Rivr at 6859-925733.|
25038|Gunpowder Creek Formation|Unit history|The Gunpowder Creek Formation as defined in this paper, includes part of the Gunpowder Creek Formation, Mingera Beds, and Ploughed Mountain Beds of Carter & others (1961). Cavaney (1975) proposed the name '"Gunpowder Siltstone" for this unit.|
25038|Gunpowder Creek Formation|Type section locality|Hypostratotype: Along 2.5 km of an unnamed tributary of Gunpowder Creek between 222176 (base) and 195187 (top) in the Mammoth Mines 1:100 0000 Sheet area. Approximately 770 m of medium grained sandstone, blocky fine grained micaceous sandstone, purple micaceous siltstone, dolomitic siltstone and leached carbonaceous shale crop out in the hypostratotype.|
25038|Gunpowder Creek Formation|Extent|The Gunpowder Creek Formation crops out extensively in the Mammoth Mines and Kennedy Gap 1:100 000 Sheet areas, in the west and southeast of the Mount Oxide 1:100 000 Sheet area, and around the Kamarga Dome in the Lawn Hill 1:100 000 Sheet area.|
25038|Gunpowder Creek Formation|Thickness range|The unit is variable in thickness with a maximum of 770 m in the hypostratotype. Only a few metres of Gunpowder Creek Formation are present in the Mount Gordon fault zone in the Mammoth Mines 1:100 000 Sheet area. Most sections are between 300 to 400 m in thickness.|
25038|Gunpowder Creek Formation|Lithology|The dominant lithology is a laminated red and green micaceous siltstone and fine grained micaceous sandstone. Dolomite, dolomitic siltstone and leached carbonaceous shale are common toward the top of the sequence. In the Lawn Hill 1:100 000 Sheet area, the unit comprises sandstone and carbonaceous shale and siltstone.|
25038|Gunpowder Creek Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The unit conformably overlies the Torpedo Creek Quartzite and is overlain conformably by the Paradise Creek Formation. The top boundary is placed at the base of the Mount Oxide Chert Member, a prominent basal marker bed of the Paradise Creek Formation. The base of the unit is placed immediately above the massive orthoquartzite or conglomerate of the Torpedo Creek Quartzite. Where the Torpedo Creek Quartzite is absent, the Gunpowder Creek Formation unconformably overlies the Surprise Creek Formation, Myally Subgroup, Judenan Beds, Fiery Creek Volcanics, Bigie Formation and Eastern Creek Volcanics.|

8033|Hampton Road Rhyolite|Unit history|Campbell (1952) applied this name to a sequence of interbedded rhyolitic flows, pyroclastics, arenite, conglomerate, and silicified mudstone.  It is well exposed along the Esk - Hampton Road along the type section designated by Cranfield & others (1976).|
8033|Hampton Road Rhyolite|Geomorphic expression|The airphotopattern is dominated by deeply incised valleys adjacent to indurated steep hills that are locally demonstrably dip slopes.|
8033|Hampton Road Rhyolite|Extent|The unit occupies an area of approximately 35 km2 of thickly forested, dominantly rugged country, between 480 and 580 m above sea level along the Esk-Hampton Road and environs.|
8033|Hampton Road Rhyolite|Thickness range|In the south the unit is 1500 m thick; in the north it thins to less than 30 m.|
8033|Hampton Road Rhyolite|Lithology|The unit contains thick rhyolite flows and pyroclastics and minor interbedded arenite, conglomerate, and chert.  The rhyolite flows are glassy, spherulitic or fluidal, and form blocky outcrops that are grey, white, or black.  Three marker bands of agglomerate, consisting of purple rhyolitic fragments set in a fine-grained green tuffaceous matrix, occur near the base of the rhyolite.  South of the Esk-Hampton Road pyroclastics predominate; these become coarse-grained to the south, indicating an eruptive centre in this direction.|
8033|Hampton Road Rhyolite|Relationships and boundaries|The unit conformably overlies the Pinecliff Formation, and is conformably overlain by the Biarraville Formation.  In the east, the Hampton Road Rhyolite is faulted against the Toogoolawah Group and the Woogaroo Subgroup by the Western Border Fault. West of this fault, outliers of Woogaroo Subgroup overlie the unit. South of the Esk - Hampton Road small bodies of the "Champion Hills Diorite" intrude the unit.|09/APR/08
8033|Hampton Road Rhyolite|Structure and Metamorphism|STRUCTURE:  Rocks of the unit dip at 450 to 800 on the southern flank of an east-south-east trending anticline, and at 450 to 600 on the northern flank. Northeast of Mount Deongwar, it is exposed on the flanks of a northerly plunging syncline, but has been differentiated only on the western limb at the present scale of mapping.|
8033|Hampton Road Rhyolite|Age reasons|No fossils are known from the type area of this unit; it was tentatively assigned an Early Permian age based on its similarity with the lower half of the Gympie Group (Rammutt Formation).  Beutel (1973) listed a fauna including Eurydesma in a dark green cherty rock from 4.5 km west of Mount Perseverance, thus indicating an Early Permian age at this locality.|
8033|Hampton Road Rhyolite|Correlations|This unit appears lithologically similar to the Rammutt Formation in the Kin Kin Subprovince of the Gympie Province near Gympie.|
8033|Hampton Road Rhyolite|Geophysical Expression|The unit has a strong potassic (pink) signature on the ternary K-Th-U radiometric image and a moderate to high magnetic response.|

8085|Hardway Granite|Name source|Hardway mine (M.L. 5633, Cloncurry Mining District) is immediately west of the most southerly mass of the Granite, 9 km west-northwest of Mary Kathleen, latitude 20o45'25"S, longitude 139o53'45"E (6856 853047).|
8085|Hardway Granite|Geomorphic expression|Tors, boulder-strewn hills, and sandy pediments.|
8085|Hardway Granite|Type section locality|The King's Cross mine area in the southern mass, latitude 20o45'S, longitude 139o54'45"E (6856 866057) is mostly leucocratin and fine-grained but contains some coarse-grained porphyritic granite, leucogranite, and micro-granite plugs and dykes.|
8085|Hardway Granite|Extent|The three main masses of Hardway Granite are aligned roughly north-south in the east of the Mary Kathleen 1:100 000 Sheet area; the largest and most southerly mass covers 12 km2, and is exposed from 1 km south to 4 km north of the Barkly Highway between 5 and 8 km west of Mary Kathleen. To the north of this mass and east of Deighton Pass another mass of this granite covers 5 km2, while a third mass a further 3 km to the north covers 2 km2. These masses were formerly a single granite mass which has been cut by strike-slip faults of the Wonga Fault System, along which up to 3 km of dextral movement has taken place.|
8085|Hardway Granite|Lithology|In the south, the Granite is relatively leucocratic and fine-grained, and is extensively veined by aplite, but is coarser-grained and richer in biotite in the northern masses. In the north medium-grained tonalite, granodiorite and diorite occur towards the contacts of the Granite with Leichhardt Metamorphics. The accessory minerals are opaque oxides, sphene, apatite and allanite.|
8085|Hardway Granite|Relationships and boundaries|Northern masses of the Hardway Granite intrude the Leichhardt Metamorphics and the Argylla Formation; the southern mass intrudes the Corella Formation 1 km east of the Mount Frosty mine. Many contacts are faulted. The areas now called Hardway Granite were mapped as Kalkadoon Granite by Carter et al. (1961) and are shown as that Granite on the Mary Kathleen 1:100 000 Preliminary Geological Map. Derrick et al. (1974) thought the Hardway granite was similar to the Wonga Granite although its generally massive character indicates less deformation than in areas of Wonga Granite about 5 km to the east.|
8085|Hardway Granite|Age reasons|No reliable isotopic age determinations are available for the Hardway granite. A sample of diorite from the northern mass yielded a Rb/Sr age of 1645+/-67 m.y. (Page, pers. comm., 1974).|

8085|Hardway Granite|Proposed publication|Queensland Government Mining Journal, 79 (1978)|
8085|Hardway Granite|Comments|Discussion: The Hardway Granite is distinguished from the Kalkadoon Granite because of its distinctive structural setting, its location, and its intrusive relations with the Corella Formation. Compositional variation from north to south, from diorite and tonalite to granodiorite, granite, leucogranite and aplite, accompanied by progressively younger country rock, probably reflects depth zoning in the original pluton, the northern mass having formed at the deepest level. Subsequent to its intrusion, the Hardway Granite was faulted, and probably folded, to form its present configuration after uplift and erosion. Numerous dolerite dykes cut the Granite.|

The interval is within the type section of the Lowmead Formation. The dominant rock type is claystone, beds of which are up to 6.45 m thick. There are abundant interbeds of oil shale (up to 4.43 m thick), sandy claystone (up to 6 m thick) and sandstone (up to 6.25 m thick). The member is calcareous. The upper boundary of the member is the contact between green claystone and carbonaceous oil shale of the Wheatley Oil Shale Member. The boundary is the contact between green sandstone and red sandstone of the Hobble Creek Member.|
24305|Harpur Creek Member|Description at type locality|The interval is within the type section of the Lowmead Formation. The dominant rock type is claystone, beds of which are up to 6.45 m thick. There are abundant interbeds of oil shale (up to 4.43 m thick), sandy claystone (up to 6 m thick) and sandstone (up to 6.25 m thick). The member is calcareous. The upper boundary of the member is the contact between green claystone and carbonaceous oil shale of the Wheatley Oil Shale Member. The boundary is the contact between green sandstone and red sandstone of the Hobble Creek Member. Claystone is dusky yellow green to greyish olive green, moderately hard to soft (puggy) and massive to laminated in part. Gastropod fragments are abundant. Oil shale is dark yellow-brown to olive-grey, hard and very thinly laminated. There are sporadic ostracod and chitinous fragments and claystone laminae. There is an oil shale bed from 76.3 m to 91.6 m in the type section which is a "marker" within the Harpur Creek Member. It is dusky yellow-brown to olive-grey oil shale. The top 1 m is carbonaceous oil shale. Sandstone is fine to coarse grained, massive, and sand grains are poorly sorted, sub-angular and of low sphericity. There are interbeds of clayey sandstone to sandy claystone.|

23642|Harry Creek Formation|Unit history|Previously mapped as the Bundock Creek Formation (now Group) by White (1959, 1962, 1965) and 'upper' Bundock Creek Formation by Wyatt & Jell (1980).  The name was first used and described by Withnall & others (1988), but was not formally defined.|
23642|Harry Creek Formation|Geomorphic expression|The Harry Creek Formation generally forms recessive, gullied topography, although light-coloured strike lines due to tuff and sandstone beds are readily discernible on aerial photographs.|
23642|Harry Creek Formation|Type section locality|About 560 m is exposed in an unnamed tributary of McKinnons Creek between 7759 371601 (base) and 365588 (synclinal hinge).  The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.|
23642|Harry Creek Formation|Description at type locality|The base is marked by a conglomerate horizon containing quartz and quartzite pebbles and cobbles in a very coarse-grained sublabile sandstone matrix.  The remainder of the unit consists of pale green to reddish brown fine-grained to lapilli tuffs and volcaniclastic sandstone.|
23642|Harry Creek Formation|Extent|Several synclinal cores in the Mount Brown Creek, Bullock Dray Creek, and Harry Creek areas.|
23642|Harry Creek Formation|Thickness range|The 560 m in the type section is probably close to the maximum thickness exposed.  The original total thickness is unknown, because the unit is restricted entirely to synclinal cores.|
23642|Harry Creek Formation|Lithology|Fine-grained to lapilli tuff, volcaniclastic sandstone, conglomerate, and siltstone.  Some tuffs are cross-bedded and laminated, and were probably water-lain and reworked.|
23642|Harry Creek Formation|Fossils|No fossils have been found in this unit.|
23642|Harry Creek Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Conformably overlies the Boroston Formation, and is distinguished from it by the abundant tuff and volcaniclastic sandstone.  Intruded by the Carboniferous or ?Permian Montgomery Range Igneous Complex.|
23642|Harry Creek Formation|Age reasons|The unit is probably Early Carboniferous (Visean?) and may be a correlative of the lithologically similar Lyall Formation in the Clarke River Group (Scott & Withnall, 1987; Withnall & others, 1988; Playford, 1988).|

8130|Haslingden Group|Name source|From 'Haslingden' pastoral holding, about 20 km north-northeast of Mount Isa, latitude 20o35'S, longitude 139o35'E, Cloncurry 1:250 000 Sheet area.|
8130|Haslingden Group|Type section locality|No type section can be specified because of variations in the distribution of type sections of the constituent formations. An almost complete section of the Group is found in a fault block centred on the Counter uranium lease 14 km northeast of Mount Isa.|
8130|Haslingden Group|Extent|The Haslingden Group occurs in a north-trending belt, centred on Mount Isa, 300 km long and up to 50 km wide. It is found in the Urandangi, Duchess, Mount Isa, Cloncurry, Camooweal and Dobbyn 1:250 000 Sheet areas.|
8130|Haslingden Group|Thickness range|The group is predominantly an arenite sequence containing interbedded basalt and minor acid volcanic units. From top to bottom, the constituent formations are as follows: Myally Subgroup - Lochness Formation 700-1200 m; Police Creek Siltstone Member 0-400 m; Whitworth Quartzite 100-2000 m; Bortala Formation 80-700 m; Alsace Quartzite 70-600 m; Eastern Creek Volcanics 3600-7200 m; Mount Guide Quartzite up to 6200 m; May Downs Gneiss Member; Leander Quartzite 1500 m.|
8130|Haslingden Group|Relationships and boundaries|The Haslingden Group unconformably overlies acid volcanics of the Leichhardt Metamorphics, and the Kalkadoon and Ewen Granites which intrude the Leichhardt Metamorphics. The Haslingden Group conformably or disconformably overlies the Argylla Formation, and is unconformably overlain by the Mount Isa Group; it is overlain conformably or disconformably by the Surprise Creek Beds. West of Mount Isa the Sybella Granite intrudes the Mount Guide Quartzite and Eastern Creek Volcanics. The Haslingden Group is broadly equivalent to the Malbon Group near Cloncurry and the Tawallah Group in the Northern Territory.|
8130|Haslingden Group|Age reasons|The Sybella Granite, part of which is dated at about 1650 m.y. places a minimum age on the Haslingden Group. A maximum age of about 1700 m.y. is inferred from Rb/Sr dates on Kalkadoon Granite and Leichhardt Metamorphcis in the basement (Plumb & Derrick, 1975).|

8130|Haslingden Group|Proposed publication|Queensland Government Mining Journal. The name has been previously published by Plumb & Derrick (1975), but its usage is incorrect because the Group incorporated the Myally and Judenan Beds, which were at the time not validly defined formations.|
8130|Haslingden Group|Comments|Remarks: Sediments of the Haslingden Group were deposited in a relatiavely stable shallow water environment, which persisted despite repeated extrusion of basalt, but was terminated by tectonism accompanying Sybella Granite intrusion. Plumb & Derrick (1975) included Judenan Beds & Carters Bore Rhyolite in the Haslingden Group. The Judenan Beads are equivalent to the Myally Subgroup, but cannot be included in the Group until they are formally renamed or defined; the Carters Bore Rhyolite is probably unconformable on Myally Subgroup rocks west and northwest of Mount Isa, and cannot be included in the Group.|
8248|Heifer Creek Sandstone Member|Name source|The name is derived from Heifer Creek in the southern Laidley Valley area in southeast Queensland.|
8248|Heifer Creek Sandstone Member|Unit history|The term was first published by McTaggart (1963) but no type section was nominated and its full extent was not adequately described. The unit as redefined corresponds to the upper predominantly quartzose sandstone of McTaggart's (1963) Heifer Creek Sandstone Member, described chiefly from the southern part of the Laidley Valley and in southeast Queensland.|
8248|Heifer Creek Sandstone Member|Geomorphic expression|The Heifer Creek Sandstone Member is resistant to erosion and commonly forms low but steep cliff faces, benches, and abrupt changes in hill slopes.|
8248|Heifer Creek Sandstone Member|Type section locality|Reference Section: No type section was given for the Heifer Creek Sandstone Member by McTaggart (1963). Gray (1975) subsequently nominated the interval 62-315 m in GSQ Ipswich 18 as the lithological reference section for the member. This section is considered to be lithologically atypical of the member, the boundaries with adjacent units are not readily redefined, and therefore is not suitable for a type section.  Type Section: The section exposed on the Clifden-Gatton road between GR 9342. 110.265/116.316 on the Helidon 1:100 000 Sheet area (9342) is here defined as the type section.|
8248|Heifer Creek Sandstone Member|Description at type locality|The Heifer Creek Sandstone Member is composed predominantly of quartz rich and some quartz lithic, medium to very coarse grained sandstone in thick to very thick beds, with steep planar cross-beds. The sandstone occurs mostly in thick fining up sequences with thin beds of granule conglomerate at the base, and grading through fine sandstone to siltstone beds at the top of the sequence. The Heifer Creek Sandstone Member is about 125 m thick in the Clifden-Gatton road section, but is about half this thickness in the southern and western parts of the basin.|
8248|Heifer Creek Sandstone Member|Extent|The Heifer Creek Sandstone Member is present mainly along the western and southern flanks and central parts of the Clarence-Moreton Basin. The member has not so far been distinguished in well sections from the central part of the Clarence-Moreton Basin. The member extends almost continuously from Murphys Creek in the north, to the upper reaches of Heifer Creek, to Warwick, Koreelah Creek, Bruxner Highway, Gwydir Highway, OBX Creek, Georges Knob, Kangaroo Creek, Glenreagh and probably as far southeast as the Dirty Creek and Coast Ranges. |
8248|Heifer Creek Sandstone Member|General description|REGIONAL ASPECTS: The member occurs at a progressively lower stratigraphic level in the Heifer Creek Formation from north to south. In the Clifden-Gatton road section the member occurs at the top of the Marburg Subgroup; on the Bruxner Highway near Tabulam it occurs near the middle of the Subgroup above the upper boundary of the Gatton Sandstone; at Blaxlands Flat it immediately overlies the Gatton Sandstone, and at Kangaroo Creek it is in contact with the Towallum Basalt which in turn overlies the Gatton Sandstone.|
8248|Heifer Creek Sandstone Member|Depositional environment|The depositional environment is low sinuosity, fluvial, stacked channel sand deposits.|
8248|Heifer Creek Sandstone Member|Fossils|Plant microfossils, including spores, pollen grains and sporadic acritarchs; non-diagnostic plant impressions and fossil wood.|
8248|Heifer Creek Sandstone Member|Relationships and boundaries|Boundaries with other units are conformable. A contact with extrusives is present in the south where the Heifer Creek Sandstone Member overlies the Towallum Basalt. The Heifer Creek Sandstone Member has a variable stratigraphic position within the Koukandowie Formation (Fig. 3). It may underlie either undifferentiated Koukandowie Formation, or the Walloon Coal Measures and overlie the Gatton Sandstone, undifferentiated Koukandowie Formation or the Towallum Basalt. Some well intersections indicate an interdigitating relationship of the member with the Koukandowie Formation. The upper boundary of the member is taken as the change from predominantly light coloured, medium to coarse and very coarse grained quartzose sandstone to silty, finer grained, khaki weathered quartz-lithic sandstone of the Koukandowie Formation, or in places by the contact with dark grey to black shale, carbonaceous shale, and volcaniclastic, quartz poor, fine grained sandstone of the Walloon Coal Measures. The lower boundary is taken as the change from predominantly medium to very coarse grained quartzose sandstone to quartz-lithic, yellow brown and khaki weathered sandstone and shale of the Koukandowie Formation, or in places, quartz and quartz lithic sandstone and grey shale and siltstone of the Ma Ma Creek Member of the Koukandowie Formation.|03/DEC/09
8248|Heifer Creek Sandstone Member|Identifying features|The quartzose lithology, coarse grainsize, pebble beds, thick to very thick beds, prominent steep planar cross beds and the scarp forming habit of the member are the principal distinguishing features.|
8248|Heifer Creek Sandstone Member|Age reasons|The age is late Early Jurassic on the evidence of spores and pollen grains from the member in the northern part of the basin chiefly in the Ipswich 1:250 000 Sheet area, where the member ranges in age from Toarcian to Bajocian, and contains palynofloras similar to those of the post-oolitic ironstone section of the upper Evergreen Formation, Hutton Sandstone and lower Eurombah Formation of the Surat Basin (De Jersey, 1971; McKellar, 1981). The Heifer Creek Sandstone Member occurs at different stratigraphic levels within the Koukandowie Formation, and may be time transgressive.|
8248|Heifer Creek Sandstone Member|Correlations|The Heifer Creek Sandstone Member is lithologically similar to the Hutton Sandstone of the Surat Basin sequence.|

8264|Heliman Formation|Name source|The name is derived from Heliman Creek, which joins the Gilbert River at GR 7560-396o2935, after crossing the Heliman Formation in two placeas (around GR 7560-330245 and -303246.|
8264|Heliman Formation|Unit history|Included by White (1965) in the 'Etheridge Formation', in which White noted the presence of 'black and grey quartz siltstone,...fine-grained quartz sandstone (locally silicified to quartzite), and lenses of chert,". Rossiter (1978) used the name Heliman Formation in referring to rocks conformably overlying the "Robertson River Metamorphics". The rocks to which he referred and which he illustrated were originally mapped by us as part of the Heliman Formation, but subsequent work has shown that they are part of a new unit, the Townley Formation, which underlies the Heliman Formation.|
8264|Heliman Formation|Geomorphic expression|Forms rounded ridges and hills on which are commonly exposed prominent beds of siliceous siltstone/fine sandstone. These beds are also prominent on airphotographs, on which the Heliman Formation generally has a light tone, especially where the sparse vegetation cover is dominated by the almost characteristic spinifex.|
8264|Heliman Formation|Type section locality|From the junction of the eastern and western branches of upper Black Gin Creek (GR 7560-252464) (bottom) southward along the western branch to GR 7560-246451.|
8264|Heliman Formation|Extent|Patchy exposure from beneath Mesozoic-Tertiary cover north of the Gilbert River (around GR 7561-202880). Exposed virtually continuously from the southern bank of the Gilbert River (GR 7561-250770), south along Pinnacle Creek, then through much of the western half of North Head 1:100 000 Sheet area. Near the southern edge of Forest Home 1:100 000 Sheet area (upper Pinnacle Creek), the Formation divides into two major 'limbs'. One swings west into the Black Gin Creek area, then continues generally south and southeast, around (or in) several large-amplitude folds, into the upper Langdon River (GR 7560-136198) and Reedy Creek (-240150 areas where it is covered by :Mesozoic sediments. This 'limb' crosses the Gilbert in one place (extremity near GR 7560-420270). The eastern 'limb' swings southeast, across the Gilbert River between Green Hills outstation and Mount MacDonald, and ends in the Table top Creek area (about GR 7560-530510). A major synformal 'outlier', about 22 km long and 2-4 km wide extends from GR 7561-300540 (head of Pinnacle Creek) to the Glenrown Creek area (GR 7560-480430), south of and parallel to the eastern 'limb'. Small synclinal outliers are in the headwaters of Pinnacle Creek (GR 7561-287545) and in the lower Mosquito Creek area (GR 7560-495365).|
8264|Heliman Formation|Thickness range|About 1225 m in the type section; ranges from about 800 m in the headwaters of Heliman Creek to about 1500 m along Black Gin Creek. However, thickness is difficult to estimate in many areas because of complex interfering folds..|
8264|Heliman Formation|Lithology|The type section consists of lowermost (500 m) and uppermost (525 m) intervals of lithic-quartz siltstone and sandstone (70-90%) and prominent beds of very dark grey siliceous siltstone and quartzose sandstone (10-30%) which are separated by a 200 m-thick interval of siltstone and fine lithic sandstone with some carbonaceous siltstone and minor siliceous siltstone. Elsewhere in the area, micaceous and/or lithic quartzose sandstones, sandy siltstone, quartzite, phyllite, and phyllitic siltstone are common, but the very dark grey siliceous siltstone-fine sandstone remains prominent and characteristic.|
8264|Heliman Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Underlain conformably by the Townley Formation, from which the Heliman Formation differs principally in the abundance and prominence in it of hard, very dark grey, 'cherty' or 'flinty' siliceous siltstone'fine sandstone. Overlain conformably by the Candlow Formation, the lowermost part of which is dominantly soft dark grey siltstone, with only very minor amounts of siliceous siltstone.|
8264|Heliman Formation|Age reasons|Probably mid-Proterozoic; a minimum age of 1570+/-30 m.y. can be inferred from dating in underlying rocks of a deformation-metamorphism event (Black et al., in press) which has affected the Heliman Formation. The Formation is also intruded by granitic rocks closely similar to the type Forsayth Granite, for which a preliminary isotopic age of 1600 m.y. has been obtained (L.P. Black, pers. comm., 1978).|

21962|Hiker Granodiorite|Name source|The unit is named after the Hiker gold mine (abandoned).|
21962|Hiker Granodiorite|Unit history|Previously mapped as Almaden Granite (Best, 1962;  Branch, 1966;  de Keyser & Lucas, 1968) or tentatively classed as a mafic variant of the Almaden Granite (de Keyser & Wolff, 1964).|
21962|Hiker Granodiorite|Geomorphic expression|The unit forms mainly prominent bouldery hilly country.  The boulders are generally covered by a black alga and the unit is characterised by medium to dark tones on aerial photographs.|
21962|Hiker Granodiorite|Type section locality|The proposed type area is around GR 2490 80915, about 1 km west of Crooked Creek. The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.|07/MAY/08
21962|Hiker Granodiorite|Extent|The granodiorite crops out over ~1 km2, 4.5 km east of Fluorspar.|
21962|Hiker Granodiorite|General description|STRUCTURE AND METAMORPHISM:: The Hiker Granodiorite is essentially massive and unmetamorphosed.MINERALISATION::  Narrow tabular gold-bearing vein and fissure-fill lodes occur in the Hiker Granodiorite not far from its contact with the Almaden Granodiorite.  The gold was concentrated in small but commonly extremely rich shoots in a kaolinite-rich gangue.|
21962|Hiker Granodiorite|Lithology|The unit consists mainly of grey, medium-grained, porphyritic, augite-biotite hornblende granodiorite and hornblende-biotite granodiorite, containing rounded mafic enclaves up to 8 cm in diameter.Plagioclase and hornblende form euhedral to subhedral phenocrysts up to 3 cm long.  Rounded quartz grains up to 1 cm in diameter also occur in some samples.  There is a considerable range in grainsize and relative mineral abundances.  Plagioclase grains typically have cores of labradorite (An56), oscillatory zoned mantles of labradorite to oligoclase (An50 - An25), and rims of oligoclase (An18) (Richards, 1981).  Richards (1981) reported plagioclase core compositions ranging from An63 to An48 in different samples.  Slightly different rock types with a fluidal texture are intimately associated in places.  Richards (1981) interpreted this texture to have resulted from the mixing of two slightly different magmas, possibly related pulses, which failed to homogenise.  Rounded mafic enclaves up to about 10 cm across are common.  These have a similar mineralogy to the host granodiorite, but the minerals are present in different proportions.|
21962|Hiker Granodiorite|Relationships and boundaries|The unit is inferred to intrude the Almaden Granodiorite.  Its relationship with Retchford Granite is not known.  The granodiorite intrudes the Jamtin Rhyolite and is cut by thin aplite dykes.|
21962|Hiker Granodiorite|Age reasons|The Hiker Granodiorite has not been isotopically dated.  It is most probably Late Carboniferous and of similar age to the other members of the Almaden Supersuite.  It cuts the Jamtin Rhyolite which has yielded an Rb-Sr white rock-biotite age of 301 ± 11 Ma (D.E. Mackenzie, personal communication, 1992).|
21962|Hiker Granodiorite|Comments|The Hiker Granodiorite is a complex heterogeneous pluton.  The presence of tabular hornblende phenocrysts up to 3 cm long is noteworthy.|

33425|Hivesville Granite|Name source|The unit is named after the township of Hivesville where good exposures of the granite are readily accessible.|30/NOV/09
33425|Hivesville Granite|Unit history|The northern part of this body was previously mapped by Murphy & others (1976), as part of the Wigton Adamellite, whereas they mapped the southern section as part of the Boondooma Igneous Complex.  The current mapping indicates that the comparable textural and lithological characteristics of both areas require their unification as one unit.  Gradwell (1956) has also described the unit in the type area.|30/NOV/09
33425|Hivesville Granite|Geomorphic expression|The unit forms recessive bouldery terrain or low undulating heavily wooded terrain that ranges in elevation from about 320m to 400m.|30/NOV/09
33425|Hivesville Granite|Type section locality|The type area is designated as the western outskirts of the township of Hivesville around AMG 369100 7104170.  The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.|30/NOV/09
33425|Hivesville Granite|Extent|The unit is irregularly distributed over a roughly triangular area, extending southeasterly from the Hivesville-Proston area to the Tingoora-Durong road. The granite is exposed over an area of roughly 200 km2.|30/NOV/09
33425|Hivesville Granite|Lithology|The typical rock type of the unit is a cream to pale grey or pink, inequigranular, coarsely megacrystic biotite granite, displaying a characteristic rapakivi texture in the type area.  The matrix is commonly a quenched aggregate of fine or medium grained quartz, feldspar and biotite. In many outcrops, the quenched matrix also contains coarse rounded quartz aggregates up to 1.5cm across as well as large feldspar phenocrysts (averaging 2-3cm across).  Where quenching has not occurred, the granite ranges from coarse to very coarse in grain size, and as the phenocryst/megacryst density increases the rocks range from porphyritic to more even grained varieties (consisting of closely packed coarse feldspar crystals).  Biotite within the granites occurs as clots, disseminated flakes or sliver-like aggregates (the latter in association with mafic xenoliths) making up to 8% of the rock. The biotites are locally aligned parallel to a tectonic or flow foliation. The phenocrysts are generally composed of perthitic alkali feldspar with subordinate plagioclase.  Where a rapakivi texture is developed, the alkali feldspars are rimmed by albite containing groundmass grains (generally quartz) which locally display micrographic intergrowth textures.  Biotite flakes are associated with accessory sphene and to a lesser extent, zircon.  Accessory opaque minerals (such as magnetite) are rare, which accounts for the low magnetic response of the granite on geophysical images.  The quartz in the granites ranges from moderately strained to strongly dynamically recrystallised.  In the most intense examples, fine subgrain aggregates of dynamically recrystallised quartz anastamose around coarser relatively undeformed feldspar aggregates and phenocrysts (e.g. around AMG 368300 7106300). A significant amount of matrix recrystallisation is commonly present in rocks that appear macroscopically undeformed.Scattered mafic xenoliths (mostly porphyritic microdiorites, tonalites) are common within the granites.  At AMG 362047 7068580 tor exposure in the creek of coarse-grained k-feldspar-phyric biotite xenolithic granite cut by rare medium grained granite dyke; xenoliths of biotite and tonalite (some foliation).  Mafic dykes sporadically intrude the unit.  They are of similar composition to the xenoliths and commonly contain feldspar phenocrysts similar to those in the granite.  The mafic/felsic contacts range from knife-sharp to crenulate in nature, the latter suggesting local liquid-liquid contact of the two magmas.  At one locality (AMG 365800 7109800), the granite displays a flow foliation around a small microdiorite body.  The granite is intruded locally by dykes and small bodies of dolerite, gabbro, andesite, aplite, rhyolite and dacite. The grid references are based on the AGD Datum.|30/NOV/09
33425|Hivesville Granite|Relationships and boundaries|The Hivesville Granite is intruded by unnamed granodiorite (Rgugd, Rg3), diorite (Rgd), gabbro/diorite (Rggd), porphyritic microgranite (Rgip), and granite bodies (Rg4) of probable Triassic age.  The teardrop shaped, Permo-Triassic Stuart River Granite also probably intrudes the unit.  Tertiary sediments and basic lavas of the Main Range Volcanics overlie the granite.  The granite is locally strongly weathered and kaolinised with a well-developed Tertiary laterite capping.|30/NOV/09
33425|Hivesville Granite|Structure and Metamorphism|DEFORMATION ::  At a few localities the granite is foliated and extensively recrystallised over zones ranging from tens of metres in width to narrow mylonitic shears up to a few centimetres wide.  The foliations are mostly north to north-northwest trending and steeply dipping.  More detailed mapping is required to determine if the foliated parts of the granite can be related to distinct map-scale faults or continuous shear zones.|
33425|Hivesville Granite|Age reasons|The unit at Hivesville has yielded a 274+/-28Ma Rb/Sr whole rock age and a 250.1Ma K/Ar biotite age (Webb & McDougall, 1968).  The most recent radiometric dates from the unit in this project are Ar/Ar dates on hornblende and biotite from two sites in the unit (AMG 368913, 7104100 and 366500, 7108800).  These gave age dates of 254.5 +/- 1.1 and 260.5 +/- 0.8 respectively (Vasconceles & Feng, 2000).  All these dates indicate a possible age range from Permian to Late Triassic.  The grid references are based on the AGD datum.|30/NOV/09
33425|Hivesville Granite|Comments|GEOPHYSICAL EXPRESSION:: The unit has a uniformly low magnetic response on magnetic images, and has pale to medium pink tones on the standard radiometric images.|30/NOV/09

8421|Holborn Granodiorite|Name source|Name is derived from the Parish of Holborn, County of Wilkie Gray.|
8421|Holborn Granodiorite|Unit history|The name Holborn Granodiorite is herein given to two masses north of Ponto Hut.|
8421|Holborn Granodiorite|Geomorphic expression|Outcrop is generally poor, and restricted to weathered outcrop in gullies.  The main exception are rocky hills in the vicinity of the reference locality.  Fresh exposures also occur in the bed of the Little Star River (North Branch) in the southern mass, such as at the type locality.  The unit generally forms subdued topography which contrasts with the hillier topography of the Argentine Metamorphics in this area.  The unit has paler tones on aerial photographs.|
8421|Holborn Granodiorite|Type section locality|The type locality is designated in the bed of the north branch of the Little Star River at 8159-230751 where grey, medium to coarse-grained, equigranular, muscovite-biotite granodiorite to tonalite crops out.  A reference locality for the northern mass is just east of the Townsville-Ravenshoe power line at 8159-210787, where grey, fine to medium-grained, equigranular biotite-muscovite granodiorite forms a treeless hill.  The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.|
8421|Holborn Granodiorite|Extent|Holborn Granite forms  two masses north of Ponto Hut.  The largest, in the upper reaches of Black Fellow Creek and its tributaries, is about 25 km2 in area, although it has only been examined south of Blackfellow Creek, mainly adjacent to the Townsville-Ravenshoe powerline.  Its northern extent is based solely on airphoto interpretation.  The other mass, in the middle reaches of the north and south branches of the Little Star River, is about 10 km2.  The plutons are separated by a narrow belt of Argentine Metamorphics.  The unit was not recognised by previous mapping (Wyatt & others, 1970).  Its name is derived from the Parish of Holborn, County of Wilkie Gray.|
8421|Holborn Granodiorite|Lithology|The southern mass consists of grey, foliated, medium to coarse-grained muscovite-biotite granodiorite to tonalite.  Regular-sided veins of muscovite pegmatite up to 1 m wide with sharp contacts cut the granodiorite in places.  No xenoliths were observed.  The foliation is generally defined by alignment of biotite, but in places the fabric is best described as a lineation rather than a foliation, and is defined by alignment of quartz.  In thin section, the quartz (30%) forms aggregates up to 1 cm of strained subgrains with highly sutured margins.  Plagioclase (40-50%) is oligoclase and occurs as subhedral, subequant grains, generally 1-3 mm across.  Microcline (<10 %) is present as anhedral, interstitial grains <1 mm.  Plagioclase shows myrmekitic replacement adjacent to microcline grains.  Biotite (15%) forms clusters of reddish brown, partly chloritised flakes up to 3 mm long.  They are deformed and commonly crosscut by muscovite flakes up to 1.5 mm long.  Muscovite (5%) also forms discrete flakes up to 3 mm across.  The northern mass is generally finer grained and more muscovite-rich.  It consists mainly of well-foliated, grey, fine to medium-grained, biotite-muscovite granodiorite.  The foliation is defined by the alignment of quartz aggregates and mica flakes.  In thin section, quartz (30%) forms aggregates up to 3 mm of subequant subgrains.  Plagioclase (40-50%) is Na-andesine, commonly showing oscillatory zoning, and occurs as subequant, subhedral grains 0.5-1 mm across.  Interstitial microcline (<10%) is associated with myrmekitic replacement of plagioclase.  Muscovite (5-10%) commonly forms large flakes up to 5 mm across, and also smaller flakes cutting across biotite flakes.  Biotite (5%) flakes are reddish brown and up to 1 mm; they are locally chloritised.  Garnet occurs in some outcrops (for example 210802) as pink, embayed, euhedral crystals up to 2 mm in diameter.  As described, the northern mass is somewhat different to the southern mass, and with further mapping could possibly be assigned to a separate unit.  However, the two are grouped at this stage, because both are muscovite-bearing, have similar geochemistry, and the full range of rock-types in both masses is not yet known.  The foliation in both masses strikes approximately east-west.|07/FEB/11
8421|Holborn Granodiorite|Relationships and boundaries|The Holborn Granodiorite intrudes the Argentine Metamorphics (Subunits PLa[subscript]s).  It is overlain to the west by the Late Devonian to Carboniferous Keelbottom Group (formerly Star beds) and Ponto Basalt Member of the Carboniferous Tareela Volcanics.  To the east it is overlain by and faulted against Carboniferous ignimbrites of the St Giles Volcanics.  Large dykes of microgranite intrude the granodiorite along the contact with the ignimbrite, and plugs of rhyolite also intrude it.  No isotopic data are available on this unit either, and its age is therefore uncertain.  However, it is likely to be in the range Ordovician to Early Devonian like most of the components of the Ravenswood and Lolworth Batholiths in the southern part of the province (Hutton & others, 1990b).|07/FEB/11

25952|Humpy Creek Member|Unit history|Part of The Narrows Beds (Kirkegaard et al, 1970) and part of the Rundle Formation (Henstridge and Missen, 1982).|
25952|Humpy Creek Member|Type section locality|23 m of oil shale and carbonaceous shale with lesser interbeds of claystone, minor impure discontinuous dolomite and rare siderite concentrations, from 120.3 to 143.3 m in drill hole ERD 169 (GR 300,999E, 7,380,998N Gladstone 1:100 000 topographic sheet. The dark yellowish-brown to dusky yellowish-brown oil shale contains two major very dark grey carbonaceous shale beds (from 125.0 to 126.0 m and 142.3 to 143.3 m in type section) and two dusky green claystone beds (from 120.3 to 120.9 and 126.0 to 127.1 m in type section). Minor greenish-grey claystone to clayey oil shale beds and impersistent carbonaceous shale layers are also interbedded with the oil shale. Minor yellowish grey impure dolomite and rare greyish-yellow siderite concentrations are recorded. Cyclicity of lithologies is a feature with oil shale grading upwards through clayey oil shale, commonly overlain by carbonaceous material. The unit is characteristically carbonaceous and generally non-calcareous.|
25952|Humpy Creek Member|Extent|Subcrops in an area of about 39 km2 in The Narrows Graben, NW of Gladstone, Queensland. The member has been identified from drill hole core.|
25952|Humpy Creek Member|Thickness range|23 m (estimated true thickness 22.7 m corrected for an apparent dip o 9o in ERD 169) in type section. Range of true thickness of the member as intersected in drill holes is 9.7 m to 29.7 m.|

24314|Idalia Rhyolite|Name source|The name is derived from the Now-abandoned 'Idalia' homestead, near the Croydon-'Esmeralda' road, at GR 7461-656585, and close to the type section.|
24314|Idalia Rhyolite|Unit history|The Idalia Rhyolite forms part of the undivided 'Croydon Felsite', later 'Croydon Volcanics' of White (1959, 1965) and Branch (1966); see also definition of Croydon Volcanic Group. It was informally named 'Idalia rhyolite' and described by Mackenzie (1983).|
24314|Idalia Rhyolite|Geomorphic expression|The Idalia Rhyolite is characterised by moderately steep, rugged, and mostly very bouldery terrain with a medium grass cover and sparsely scattered, low trees. The tone on airphotos is very pale, and on many hillsides, numerous step-like breaks in slope, which represent boundaries of ignimbrite flow sheets, are visible. |
24314|Idalia Rhyolite|Type section locality|The type section extends eastward from GR 7461-661583 on Nonda Creek near 'Idalia', along the northern side of the creek to 0674577, thence east-northeast to -683580, and northeast to -688586 (crest of ridge). This section consists of about 200 m of greenish to bluish-grey, medium-grained, moderately crystal-rich rhyolitic ignimbrite in about 20 separate flow sheets. The base of the section is a contact with Tertiary sediments, close to an intrusive contact with Nonda Granite. The top of the section is the stratigraphically highest ignimbrite flow unit preserved in the area; the top of the Idalia Rhyolite is probably not preserved. A useful reference section is along the Croydon-'Tabletop' road, between 7361-335972 (lower conformable(?) contact with Carron Rhyolite) and 366012 (upper, faulted contact with Caron Rhyolite), in which is exposed about 250 m of typical, greenish-grey, moderately crystal-rich rhyolitic ignimbrite.|
24314|Idalia Rhyolite|Extent|The Idalia Rhyolite crops out over about 2500 km2 (over 80% of the outcrop area of the Croydon Volcanic Group), extending almost continuously in a 110 km-long, arcuate belt from south of the Carron River (between 18o and 18o09'S) to the Yappar River (18o59'S). This belt is 30-40 km wide over most of its length, but narrows to about 12 km at its southern end. In the Croydon area, several eastward-tilted, elongated blocks have been isolated from the main outcrop area by normal faults along their eastern sides. The largest, to the east and northeast of Croydon, is 30 km long and up to 15 km wide; a second, north of Croydon, is 17 km long and up to 8 km wide. A third block, 5 km by 1 km, forms the Surrey Hills, 7 km southeast of Croydon, and the fourth fault block, 15 km southeast of Croydon, is 9 km by 2 km.|
24314|Idalia Rhyolite|Thickness range|Because the top of the Idalia Rhyolite is almost certainly not preserved at any location, original thickness cannot be estimated with any certainty. Thickness as exposed is about 100 m over much of the area, and ranges from about 40 to 60 m in the south and west to about 150 m between Maitland and Three X Creeks. A thickness of 250 m is estimated for the fault block northeast of Croydon, but this may be affected by folding, or faulting, or both.|
24314|Idalia Rhyolite|Lithology|The Idalia Rhyolite is made up of medium greenish to bluish-grey, moderatley crystal-poor to moderately crystal-rich rhyolitic ignimbrite, which is variably altered and recrystallised. It contains 10-25% (typically 15-20%) crystals, including about 1% biotite and, in some rocks, a trace of garnet, ranging from less than 0.5 mm up to 3-4 mm. Most rocks contain a small amount of graphite (up to 1%), mostly aggregated into rounded 'pellets' up to 1 cm in diameter. Eutaxitic foliation, defined by fiamme ranging from a few mm long to several cm long and about 1 cm thick, are present in some rocks, mostly from near the top or the bottom of the unit.|
24314|Idalia Rhyolite|Relationships and boundaries|The Idalia Rhyolite overlies apparently conformably, the Carron Rhyolite, which is finer-grained, markedly less crystal-rich, and commonly displays pseudo flow banding, or, more rarely, true flow banding/lamination. It appears to grade westward and stratigraphically downward into the darker, more mafic, and more intensely recrystallised Democrat Rhyolite Member. The unit is intruded by the Middle Proterozoic Esmeralda, Nonda, Mooremount, Macartneys and Olsens Granites, the Permian Awring Granodiorite, and the Permian? Wallys Dolerite. It is unconformably overlain by the Middle to Late Proterozoic Inorunie Group, the Mesozoic Eulo Queen Group, Gilbert River Formation, and Wallumbilla Formation, the Late Cretaceous to Tertiary Bulimba Formation, and a variety of Cainozoic fluviatile and residual deposits.|
24314|Idalia Rhyolite|Age reasons|The Idalia Rhyolite, together with its component member, the Democrat Rhyolite Member, and the Carron Rhyolite haave been isotopically dated at 1400+/-75 Ma (Richards & others, 1966; Black, 1973).|

8773|Iron Hut Quartz Monzonite|Geomorphic expression|The terrain is gentle to moderately undulating. Tors such as Mount Pleasant, Mount Livingstone, and Mount Hammond dominate the south of the pluton. Elsewhere, isolated boulder-sized outcrop is common.  The Iron Hut Quartz Monzonite has a yellow-orange hue on the Landsat 5 TM 1-4-7 (BGR) image where it is not concealed by purple-coloured Cainozoic cover. The area is only partly cleared, and the pluton is characterised by areas of low, and moderate to high relief. The Iron Hut Quartz Monzonite is very strongly magnetic, and has low to weak Th anomalies, strong K response, and patchy U response.|06/MAR/08
8773|Iron Hut Quartz Monzonite|Type section locality|The quarry near at 8452-572786 Theresa Creek Dam. Grey, fine to medium-grained, equigranular hornblende-biotite quartz monzonite is exposed, and is locally intruded by dykes of dark grey porphyritic micromonzonite. Complex crenulate contacts to the dykes suggest that the quartz monzonite was still partly molten when the dykes were emplaced.  The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.|18/MAR/08
8773|Iron Hut Quartz Monzonite|Description at type locality|Grey, fine to medium-grained, equigranular hornblende-biotite quartz monzonite is exposed, and is locally intruded by dykes of dark grey porphyritic micromonzonite. Complex crenulate contacts to the dykes suggest that the quartz monzonite was still partly molten when the dykes were emplaced.|
8773|Iron Hut Quartz Monzonite|Extent|A large irregular body 60km2 in area, centred on Theresa Creek Dam.|
8773|Iron Hut Quartz Monzonite|Lithology|Grey, fine to medium-grained, equigranular to porphyritic hornblende-biotite quartz monzonite and pink to grey, fine to medium-grained porphyritic micromonzonite.|
8773|Iron Hut Quartz Monzonite|Relationships and boundaries|The Iron Hut Quartz Monzonite intruded and hornfelsed the Early to Middle Devonian Theresa Creek Volcanics and is unconformably overlain by the Late Devonian to Early Carboniferous Silver Hills Volcanics, which separate it from the Sunny Park Granodiorite. Its relationship to the Stevenson Quartz Monzodiorite is unknown. Several small plugs of Tertiary Hoy Basalt intrude the southern part of the unit.|
8773|Iron Hut Quartz Monzonite|Age reasons|The precise age is uncertain, but because of its relationships to the Theresa Creek Volcanics and Silver Hills Volcanics and similarity to the Stevenson Quartz Monzodiorite a Devonian age has been assigned.|06/MAR/08

27085|Jack Formation|Name source|Jack Hills, a ridge of limestone north of the Broken River.  The ridge was named after geologist R.L. Jack by White (1959), and appears on the Clarke River 1.250 000 1st edition geological sheet.|10/APR/08
27085|Jack Formation|Unit history|The unit was previously defined as the Jack Limestone Member of the Graveyard Creek Formation (now Group) (White, 1959, 1962, 1965).  It was given formation status by Withnall & others (1988), but not formally redefined.|
27085|Jack Formation|Geomorphic expression|The unit forms a broad ridge, the Jack Hills , which consist of two lines of prominent limestone bluffs and outcrops with typical karst features, and which are readily discernible on aerial photographs.  Only one line of outcrops occurs northeast of Gorge Creek.|
27085|Jack Formation|Type section locality|Jack Hills Gorge on the Broken River, between 7859 660453 and 655455, where  580 m of limestone (in two main lenses at the top and bottom of the section), arenite, and mudstone as described below are exposed.  See Fleming (1987) and Withnall & others (1988, figure 27, 81, and 82, and pages 152-155) for more details.  The grid references are based on the AGD66 datum.|10/APR/08
27085|Jack Formation|Extent|Interfolded with the Poley Cow and Shield Creek Formations in a belt about 20 km long from the headwaters of Back and Poley Cow Creeks to Storm Dam and Dosey Creek.|
27085|Jack Formation|Thickness range|580 m in the type section, thinning to the south.  The limestone lenses out both to the south and north, but in the north the siliciclastic rocks probably maintain the overall thickness.|
27085|Jack Formation|Lithology|Limestone, micaceous labile arenite, pebbly quartzose arenite, and mudstone. Limestone in large lenses is thick to very thick-bedded or unbedded and massive. Local oolites and oncolites in some small lenses.  Arenites are generally thick bedded and locally cross bedded.  Further lithological details included in the Relationships section......|
27085|Jack Formation|Fossils| A locally rich fauna of favositid, heliolitid, and rugose corals, stromatoporoids, brachiopods, trilobites, and very rare conodonts indicates a Ludlow to early Lochkovian age.  See Withnall & others (1988) for more details.|
27085|Jack Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The unit conformably or possibly disconformably overlies the Poley Cow Formation, and locally unconformably overlies the Judea Formation.  It is disconformably(?) overlain by the Shield Creek Formation, and locally by the Storm Hill Sandstone.  In the type area and adjacent area, the large limestone lenses at the top and base distinguish the unit.  These lens out to the south and north.  To the north, discontinuous lenses of quartzose arenite and conglomerate mark the base of the unit.  Arenites within the unit are generally more micaceous than in the Poley Cow Formation.  The overlying units consist of coarse-grained feldspathic and quarzose arenite.|

26308|Jayah Creek Metabasalt|Name source|Named after Jayah Creek, whose tributaries drain part of the northern outcrop area, Ardmore 1:100 000 Sheet area (Urandangi 1:250 000 Sheet area).|
26308|Jayah Creek Metabasalt|Unit history|Mapped as Eastern Creek Volcanics by Noakes & others (1959), and described by Joplin (1955; page 38) as an 'older metamorphic complex'. Extensions to the north in the Oban 1:100 000 Sheet area have been mapped as Eastern Creek Volcanics.|
26308|Jayah Creek Metabasalt|Type section locality|From GR 291069 to GR 343114, about 17 km NW of Dajarra, Ardmore 1:100 000 Sheet area. The old main road between Dajarra and Mount Isa via Sulieman Bore and an abandoned railway track cross the western part of the type section. A complete section from the base to the top of the sequence is not exposed. The formation (including the Timothy Creek Sandstone Member) in the type section consists mainly of foliated to schistose fine-grained amygdaloidal and massive metabasalt, and numerous interlayered lenses of quartzose, sericitic and feldspathic meta-arenite and quartzite, glassy or epidotic quartzite, and muscovite quartzite. Minor rock types include recrystallised limestone, muscovite schist, and quartz-biotite schist. The Timothy Creek Sandstone Member is a relatively thick unit of mainly pebbly meta-arenite.|
26308|Jayah Creek Metabasalt|Extent|The sequence forms a NNW-trending belt in the central part of the Ardmore 1:100 000 Sheet area. It extends S and N into the Glenormiston 1:250 000 and Oban 1:100 0000 Sheet areas respectively.|
26308|Jayah Creek Metabasalt|Thickness range|The thickness of the sequence is unknown; it appears to be about 6200 m thick in the type section, and has an apparent maximum thickness of about 15 000 m, 20.5 km SW of Dajarra.|
26308|Jayah Creek Metabasalt|Lithology|Mainly foliated to schistose, fine-grained, amygdaloidal and massive meta-basalt, fine to medium-grained amphibole schist, quartz + muscovite + biotite +/- feldspar +/- cordierite schist and gneiss, quartzite, muscovite quartz, and quartzose, sericitic, and feldspathic meta-arenite and quartzite. Minor rock types include para-amphibolite, siliceous and micaceous metasiltstone, pebbly labile meta-arenite and quartzite, recrystallised limestone, quartz-muscovite-biotite rock (at GR 299858) containing numerous cordierite poikiloblasts, calcareous meta-arenite, laminted biotite-rich rocks (?mafic tuffs) and conglomerate (rare). The sequence is characterised by numerous metasedimentary units, interlayered with the metabasalts and ranging in thickness from less than 1 m up to about 2000 m (Timothy Creek Sandstone Member). In the NW argillaceous metasediments are very common, whereas in the central and southern parts of the belt arenaceous and ?tuffaceous metasediments are relatively common.|
26308|Jayah Creek Metabasalt|Relationships and boundaries|The Jayah Creek Metabasalt is truncated by the Wonomo Fault in the east and by the Rufus Fault Zone in the west. The contact between Jayah Creek Metabasalt and Sulieman Gneiss about 23 km SW of Dajarra appears to be gradational. However, coarse chlorite rock developed in the Sulieman Gneiss in places adjacent to this contact may indicate that the contact is faulted. Alternatiavely, the chlorite is generally closely associatead with northerly trending pegmatite veins and its formation may have been related to the intrusion of the pegmatites (which may or may not have been intruded along a fracture zone separating the two formations). The formation may be unconformably overlain by a poorly exposed sequence of relatively unmetamorphosed meta-arenite, metasiltstone, and shale, tentatively assigned to the Mount Isa Group, about 6 km W of Rundle Bore (GR 391829). It is unconformably overlain by flat-lying to gently dipping Middle Cambarian and ?Mesozoic sediments in the S. The sequence is cut by numerous pods and dykes of metadolerite, by granite mapped as part of the Sybella Granite batholith, and by numerous veins of quartz, and quartz+feldspar+muscovite+/-tourmaline pegmatite. The formation is also cut by thin (<20 m) dykes of quartz porphyry, and quartz-feldspar porphyry.|
26308|Jayah Creek Metabasalt|Age reasons|Precambrian, probably Proterozoic.|
26308|Jayah Creek Metabasalt|Proposed publication|Blake  & others, in preparation.|
26308|Jayah Creek Metabasalt|Comments|Remarks: The regional metamorphic grade increases from east to west and may possibly be attributed to relatively low-pressure high-temperature metamorphism associated with the emplacement of the Sybella Granite batholith. The presence of cordierite in argillaceous metasediments in the western part of the belt indicates amphibolite facies of regional metamorphism (Winkler, 1976). Joplin (1955) recorded cordierite, andalusite, and sillimanite in a gneiss collected a few metres west of the old Dajarra Mount Isa road, about 10.5 km NW of Sulieman Bore (GR 323027). The metamorphic grade in the east may be about upper greenschist facies. The Jayah Creek Metabasalt may be equivalent to the regionally metamorphosed, lithologically similar sequence mapped as Eastern Creek Volcanics west of the Mount Isa Fault, in the Mount Isa 1:100 000 Sheet area to the north (Derrick & others, 1976). However, it is shown as a separate formation on the Ardmore 1:100 000 map because it has several characteristics not shared with rocks mapped as Eastern Creek Volcanics in the eastern part of the sheet area - for example, conglomeratic sediments containing abundant felsic volcanic clasts are very common in the east, whereas conglomerate is very rare in the Jayah Creek Metabasalt ahd no pebbles or felsic volcanics have been positively identified. Meta-argillite, para-amphibolite, and ?tuffaceous metasediments are abundant in places in the Jayah Creek Metabasalt, but are scarce or absent in the Eastern Creek Volcanics to the east. Such differences may be the result of facies variations from east to west, or they may indicate that the two formations are not equivalent.|

25962|Jericho Formation|Type section locality|In ENL Lake Galilee 1 from 1815 m (5955 ft) to 2578 m (8458 ft) K.B. Cuttings and Cores from this interval are available at the Core Library, Redbank.|
25962|Jericho Formation|Extent|Present in the majority of wells in the northeastern Galilee Basin; absent in AAO Beryl 1, WNL Brookwood 1 and MPC Corfield 1 on the Beryl Ridge and LOL Hulton 1 on the Hulton-Rand structure. The unit has been continuously cored in GSQ Jericho 2 and GSQ Springsure 13 (Gray, in prep.).|
25962|Jericho Formation|Thickness range|763 m in the type section; 699 and 733 m in AOD Jericho 1 and GSQ Jericho 2 respectively. The formation thins westward onto the Beryl Ridge as a result of the progressive onlap of rising basement.|
25962|Jericho Formation|Lithology|The Jericho Formation in the type section consists of mudstone, siltstone and minor sandstone. A conspicuous siltstone member - defined below as the Oakleigh Siltstone Member - occurs within the formation. Cores 23 to 30 inclusive were cut in the type section, and are described in detail by Pemberton in Exoil N.L. (1965). Mudstone is dark grey, green-grey and brown, and fissile. Siltstone is green, brown and grey, and carbonaceous. Sandstone is generally light grey, green, fine to medium, labile to sub-labile and slightly calcareous. The Jericho Formation is readily distinguished from the overlying Jochmus Formation on wireline logs. The top of the Jericho Formation is taken at the top of the highest, thick mudstone or siltstone below the dominantly sandy lower Jochmus Formation. This position is distinguishable on the majority of wireline logs, particularly the resistivity and gamma-ray logs. The base of the Jericho Formation is taken at the top of the highest, thick bed of silicified sandstone as indicated by the wireline logs. The lithological contrast between mudstone and clean silicified sandstone is great enough to produce sharp changes on the wireline logs.|
25962|Jericho Formation|Depositional environment|Probably a complex fluviatile and lacustrine environment with a glacial influence. Arthropod trails and ?mud cracks were observed in the core of GSQ Jericho 2, suggesting periodic subaerial exposure.|
25962|Jericho Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The Jericho Formation conformably overlies the Lake Galilee Sandstone in the Lake Galilee and Jericho areas; elsewhere it rests unconformably on crystalline basement or pre-Late Carboniferous sediments. It is conformably overlain by the Jochmus Formation.|
25962|Jericho Formation|Age reasons|Late Carboniferous to Early Permian. Spore assemblages characteristic of Stages 1 and 2 of Evans (1969) have been recorded.|

23667|Jessey Springs Limestone|Relationships and boundaries|The unit is part of the Wando Vale Subgroup of the Broken River Group.  It interfingers with the Burges Formation which is mapped as both underlying and overlying the limestone.  Under the laterite cover to the northeast, the Jessey Springs Limestone may be continuous with the Lockup Well Limestone.|
23667|Jessey Springs Limestone|Age reasons|Conodonts indicate a late Emsian to probably early Givetian age.|

8952|Jiggamore Member|Unit history|Generally equates with Unit 3 of Casey (1968) and Member (ii) of Druce (1976) and the upper part of the Variegated Limestone/Dolomite member of Jones et al. (1971).|
8952|Jiggamore Member|Type section locality|Black Mountain (140o17'E, 22o32'S), the interval from 165 m to 371 m within the Ninmaroo Formation from 259087 (140o16'45"E, 22o31'40"S) to 257090 (140o16'35"E, 22o31'30"S).|
8952|Jiggamore Member|Extent|The unit is exposed in a 120 km belt from Mt Datson in the south (Boulia 1:250 000 sheet area) to Mt Merlin in the north (Duchess 1:250 000 sheet area).|
8952|Jiggamore Member|Thickness range|206 m at Black Mountain; 92 m at Mt Datson; 130 m at Mt Ninmaroo.|
8952|Jiggamore Member|Lithology|Thin to thick bedded limestone (micrite, frequently bioturbated; clast peloidal and peloidal grainstone (Dunham, 1962), minor ooid grainstone, diagnostic two-tone limestone), dolostone, dolomite breccia (pressure solution origin); calcareous siltstone.|
8952|Jiggamore Member|Relationships and boundaries|Diagnostic two-tone patterns are a conspicuous diagenetic overprint which has gradational limits. The lower boundary is drawn at the first major occurrent of two-tone limestones in a sequence which is generally composed of such limestones. The upper boundary is drawn at the incoming of relatively abundant flat-pebble conglomerates. Regionally stratiform and apparently conformable, the boundaries may be discordant at a smaller scale.|
8952|Jiggamore Member|Age reasons|The unit yields conodonts (Druce & Jones, 1971), rostroconch mulluscs (Pojeta et al., 1977 and nautiloids. These indicate an Early Ordovician (Datsonian) age.|

8991|Jochmus Formation|Type section locality|In ENL Lake Galilee 1 from 1060 m (3476 ft) to 1815 m (5955 ft) K.B. Cores and cuttings of this interval are available at the Core Library, Redbank.|
8991|Jochmus Formation|Extent|Present in all exploratory wells drilled in the northeastern Galilee Basin except AAO Beryl 1 and MPC Corfield 1 on the Beryl Ridge.|
8991|Jochmus Formation|Thickness range|755 m in the type section; thins westward, being 466 m and 358 m in QDM Aramac 1 and PON Muttaburra 1 respectively. Thins Southwards by erosion to 529 m and 319 m in QDM Hexham 1 and AOD Jericho 1 respectively.|
8991|Jochmus Formation|Lithology|The Jochmus Formation consists of a lower part composed mainly of sandstone, a middle part composed of mudstone, siltstone and tuff and an upper part composed of sandstone, siltstone and mudstone. The middle part is defined as the Edie Tuff Member. Cores 14 to 24 inclusive were cut in the type section and are described in detail by Pemberton in Exoil N.L. (1965). Sandstones are generally light grey, green, rarely brown and reddish, fine to medium, moderately to well sorted, labile and locally conglomeratic. Porosity is developed in parts. Siltstone is light to medium grey and grey-green, argillaceous to sandy, hard, brittle, and carbonaceous. Mudstone is grey-green, silty, tuffaceous in part, slightly micaceous and carbonaceous; bedding is varve-like in part. The Jochmus Formation contains the "Red Tuff Marker" of Cundill, Meyers and Schultz (1971). It occurs at three or more different stratigraphic levels depending on the amount of truncation of the Jochmus Formation. The commonest occurrence is in the lower part of the Edie Tuff Member.|

28230|Joe Joe Group|Name source|The name Joe Joe Creek Series was used by Shell Queensland Development (1952) and amended to Joe Joe Creek Formation by Hill (1957); it was abbreviated to Joe Joe Formation by Mollan et al. (1969). The name is derived from Joe Joe Creek in the northwestern part of the Springsure 1:250 000 Sheet area; the type area is in the vicinity of the creek. A type section was not proposed. Recent stratigraphic drilling (Gray, in prep.) has demonstrated that the Joe Joe Formation of the type area consists almost entirely of the Jericho Formation of the subsurface. The name Joe Joe Formation has been used in surface mapping in the Tambo and Jericho Sheet areas for strata which recent stratigraphic drilling has shown to consist of the Jochmus Formation, the Jericho Formation and the Lake Galilee Sandstone of the subsurface. Therefore, it is appropriate to raise the name Joe Joe to group status. The Joe Joe Group is defined as that succession of formations which is unconformably overlain by the Colinlea Sandstone and it's lateral correlative, and unconformably overlies strata of the Adavale and Drummond Basins or other pre-Late Carboniferous rocks. The Joe Joe Group consists of the Lake Galilee Sandstone (lowermost), the Jericho Formation, the Jochmus Formation and the Aramac Coal Measures. The type sections of the lower three formations are designated in ENL Lake Galilee 1 to avoid the possibility of a miscorrelation. The type section of the Aramac Coal Measures is designated in QDM Aramac 1 well. The maximum known thickness of the Joe Joe Group is 1781 m in ENL Lake Galilee 1 well. The Joe Joe Group consists entirely of non-marine sediments; a glacial influence is apparent in parts. It has yielded spore assemblages assigned to Stages 1, 2 and 3 of Evans (1969); its age is presumed to be Late Carboniferous to Early Permian.|

25723|Judea Formation|Unit history|White (1959, 1962, 1965) mapped the unit as part of the Wairuna Formation, but it was subsequently mapped and defined as the Judea beds by Arnold & Henderson (1976).  It was given formation status by Withnall & others (1988), but not redefined.|
25723|Judea Formation|Geomorphic expression|The Judea Formation generally produces low hilly topography, slightly more elevated than surrounding units.  Strike lines are not well developed, and the photo-pattern is relatively uniform.  The unit is commonly covered with a low scrub of quinine bush and stunted eucalypts.|
25723|Judea Formation|Type section locality|Broken River between 7859 670443 (anticlinal hinge) and 662442 (unconformity with Poley Cow Formation).  Fine-grained quartzose arenite, mudstone, basalt and keratophyre are exposed.  The thickness is not known because of small-scale folding, but is estimated as less than 700 m.  The grid references are based on the AGD66 datum.|
25723|Judea Formation|Extent|Forms a narrow strip up to 2km wide between Greenvale and Tomcat Creek, and also occurs in anticlinal cores in the Broken River area.|
25723|Judea Formation|Thickness range|Less than 1500 m.|
25723|Judea Formation|Lithology|Fine-grained quartzose arenite, mudstone, basalt, and keratophyre. Arenites are thin to very thick bedded, and show grading, horizontal stratification, cross laminae, soft sediment deformation, flutes and load casts.  The rocks are commonly strongly deformed with disrupted bedding and melange.|
25723|Judea Formation|Fossils|Rare Tetragraptus sp. (Withnall & others, 1988) indicates an Early Ordovician age.  Limestone from west of the Gray Creek Complex contains poorly preserved favositids and heliolitids as well as conodonts which suggest a Middle Ordovician age (Palmieri, 1984).|

26309|Juntala Metamorphics|Name source|Parish of Juntala, County of Percy; also Juntala Holding in which part of the unit crops out.|
26309|Juntala Metamorphics|Unit history|White (1962a,b: 1965) equated the schist and quartzite near Werrington with the Paddys Creek Formation, whose main outcrop area and type area are in the Greenvale area, about 90-100 km to the northeast. Because the relationship between the Proterozoic rocks in the Greenvale area and those in the rest of the Georgetown Province are uncertain, it is considered that renaming the rocks near Werrington is justified.|
26309|Juntala Metamorphics|Type section locality|The best and most continuous outcrop occurs along Yarraman Creek. The outcrop is about 50 percent for 12 km from 570912 to 474910 (Lyndhurst 1:100 000 Sheet area - 7759) and passes through approximately 4000-6000 m of section. The type section is overlain in the north by alluvium. In the south it is faulted against gneisses of the Einasleigh Metamorphics. The compositional layering in general is vertically dipping, strikes NNE-NE and has been folded by at least three of the regional folding events recognised in the Georgetown Inlier (D1, D2, D4). All sedimentary textures are destroyed except for the compositional layering (bedding); therefore no younging criteria occur. The sequence consists of interbedded mica schists, graphitic schists, micaceous quartzites, quartzites, amphibolites, pegmatites, and minor granitic phases. The main rock types are the mica schists and quartzites, interbedded with a zone of distinctive graphitic schist which may or may not be a single 'lithological' unit. The mica schist and graphitic schists are the dominant rock types in the north of the section with minor bands of quartzite and micaceous quartzite. The quartzites and micaceous quartzites become more prominent towards the south of the section. Occasionally interlayered with the other rock types are minor bands of amphibolite, 1-10 m thick. These also tend to be more common in the south of the section. Pegmatites also become more common towards the southern end of the section, occurring as small (a few centimetres) to quite large (10-20 m) veins parallel to the layering. Minor bodies of fine grained biotite granitic rock are present; they are possibly related to the pegmatites.|
26309|Juntala Metamorphics|Extent|The Juntala Metamorphics are exposed over an area of approximately 144 km2 in the central western part of the Clark River 1:250 000 Sheet area (SE 55-13), due west of Werrington homestead. These rocks also extend into the eastern part of the Gilberton 1:250 000 Sheet area (SE 54-16) (southeastern part of the Gilberton 1:100 000 Sheet area (7659)).|
26309|Juntala Metamorphics|Thickness range|Unknown because of the complex deformation.|
26309|Juntala Metamorphics|Lithology|Mica schist - contains quartz, feldspar, mica (muscovite and/or biotite), and locally garnet, andalusite, staurolite, chlorite, chloritoid, and minor graphite. These rocks are often interlayered with narrow bands of quartzite of the order of a few centimetres thick. Graphitic schist - black schist, consisting of quartz, feldspar, mica (muscovite and/or biotite), and graphite; andalusite is present locally. Quartzite - ranges from micaceous quartzite to relatively pure quartzite, and from finely laminated to massive.  Amphibolite - metamorphosed gabbro still showing the original gabbroic texture, and consisting of hornblende, feldspar and rare garnet.  Pegmatite - quartz-feldspar-muscovite pegmatite occurs as veins in the schists and quartzites.  Granite - fine grained biotite granite, possibly related to the pegmatites.   All rocks are deformed and all contain the S2 foliation. The schists and quartzites and possibly the amphibolites were deformed by D1, which produced a strong slaty cleavage parallel to the lithological layering. All      rocks included in the unit were deformed by the D2 event which produced an intense crenulation cleavage in the previously deformed rocks, and a good slaty cleavage in the granitic rocks. Effects of later deformations are common, especially D4 and D5.|
26309|Juntala Metamorphics|Relationships and boundaries|The Juntala Metamorphics are faulted against gneisses of the Einasleigh Metamorphics along the entire eastern margin. Along the western margin the schists and quartzites grade into and are partly faulted against more gneissic rocks mapped as Einasleigh Metamorphics, and are intruded by younger granitic rocks which may be equated with Proterozoic or Siluro-Devonian Anning Granite, and Proterozoic Digger Creek Granite. To the south the metamorphics are intruded by and possibly faulted against the Carboniferous Purkin Granite. The unit crops out poorly along its northern margin and is overlain by alluvium.|
26309|Juntala Metamorphics|Age reasons|Proterozoic. Because of the similarity of style and number of deformation events in the Juntala Metamorphics to those of the Robertson River Metamorphics and Einasleigh Metamorphics, it is considered that the units are all of similar age; the deformational and metamorphic events in the Juntala Metamorphics should have similar ages to those in the Robertson River Metamorphics and Einasleigh Metamorphics. Black & others (1979) dated the first three events D1, D2 and D3 at approximately 1570, 1470 and 970 million years, respectively. The schists, quartzites, and possibly the amphibolites in the Juntala Metamorphics are pre-D1 in age, and the granitic rocks are pre- or Syn-D2 in age.|

9108|Kajabbi Formation|Name source|The town of Kajabbi 90 km northwest of Cloncurry; latitude 20o1'55"S, longitude 140o2'10"E (6957-993847).|
9108|Kajabbi Formation|Unit history|Most of the Kajabbi Formation was previously mapped as Proterozoic Corella Formation (Carter et al., 1961).|
9108|Kajabbi Formation|Geomorphic expression|The quartzite in the south occurs as low, rounded ridges. The limestone tends to be recessive and is exposed in stream channels and breakaways that cut through the Mesozoic cover rocks. Some well exposed pavements and blocky slightly disturbed flat-lying to gently dipping sheets of limestone occur.|
9108|Kajabbi Formation|Type section locality|The type section is located along a low escarpment near the south bank of the Leichhardt River from a point 2.5 km south-southwest of Kajabbi (latitude 20o3'8"S, longitude 140o2'45"E; 6957-002832). The oldest rocks in the type section are approximately 30 m of brecciated thinly-bedded cross-bedded coarse-grained sandstone which are exposed in the west of the section adjacent to the Pinnacle Fault. The sandstone is overlain by a laminated partly brecciated chert sequence approximately 15 m thick. The chert sequence is overlain by about 140 m of grey thin-bedded to laminated silty limestone and calcareous siltstone. The base of the unit is not exposed in the type section because of faulting. Faulting also complicates the basal relations of the unit in other outcrops to the south of the type section. The basal relation is defined in the diamond drill core from a depth of 257 m in BHP 4 which is sited 400 m west of the eastern end of the type section (6957--996832). In this drill core, poorly sorted sandstone overlies folded quartzose metasediments that are correlated with the Corella Formation. The upper boundary of the Kajabbi Formation is an erosional unconformity with ferruginous clayey conglomerate of Mesozoic age which is exposed in the east of the type section. To the east and south of the type section three other holes drilled by BHP penetrate a total of more than 300 m of additional Cambrian strata which are not exposed. This sequence is regarded as the upward extension of the Kajabbi Formation and the three drill holes, BHP 1 (6957-076825), BHP 2 (6957-046774) and BHP 3 (6957-005704) are designated reference sections of this part of the formation. The top of the type section and the top of BHP 4 occur at approximately the same stratigraphic level which is tentatively correlated with rocks at about 150 m in BHP 3. The overlying sequence in BHP 3 contains laminated micaceous argillaceous calcareous siltstone (67 to 150 m), a cyclic unit consisting of rhythmic repetitions of laminated siltstone, limestone and carbonaceous shale (53 to 67 m), and grey laminated calcareous siltstone (0 to 53 m). The cyclic unit is correlated with the section from 136 to 165 m in BHP 2 and the basal part of BHP 1 (222 to 240 m). The upper part of the Cambrian sequence is most complete in BHP 1 where the cyclic unit is overlain by finely banded and laminated calcareous siltstone and silty limestone (85 to 222 m) and thinly bedded limestone and calcareous siltstone (41 to 85 m).|
9108|Kajabbi Formation|Extent|The unit is exposed at eight localities from 1 km to 36 km south of Kajabbi and has a total area of outcrop of about 8 km2. All known outcrops are in the Quamby 1:100 000 Sheet area but the unit probably extends to the north as subcrop in the Landsborough Graben.|
9108|Kajabbi Formation|Thickness range|The thickness estimated from the composite drill sections is at least 500 m and may exceed 600 m.|
9108|Kajabbi Formation|Lithology|The Kajabbi Formation consists of two distinct lithologic units: a lower sandy unit which is exposed mostly in the south, and an upper silty limestone unit which is exposed in the north. The rocks in the upper unit are mainly pinkish brown to grey, massive to laminated calcareous siltstone, grey, silty limestone, laminated and brecciated chert, and whitish grey finely laminated siltstone. The limestones are locally pyritic and the siltstone contains rare fossils. In the south, buff, fine to medium grained poorly sorted quartzite and feldspathic calcareous sandstone of the lower unit predominate. From the BHP drill logs (Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, 1977) the base of the Cambrian sequence in the west consists of approximately 5 m of poorly sorted calcareous sandstone grading upward into sandy limestone and pure massive limestone about 20 m thick. This is overlain by deep red to pale grey coarse-grained, porous, slightly pyritic sandstone about 80 m thick, and then fractured massive dolomite or limestone with numerous chert bands and pyritic bands. The remainder of the Cambrian sequence is a very uniform laminated to thin-bedded calcareous siltstone and silty limestone about 400 m thick.  This sequence contains minor carbonaceous layers and zones of disseminated pyrite, and generally becomes more calcareous towards the top. It also contains some breccia zones from 1 to 3 m thick and a "cyclic" unit about 14 m thick. The cycles are 1 to 2 m thick and grade from a basal laminated calcareous siltstone upward into a limestone which becomes carbonaceous towards the top of the cycle. The top of each cycle is marked by a layer of carbonaceous shale generally less than 1 cm thick. The breccia zones and the "cyclic" unit have been used as stratigraphic markers in the four diamond drill holes.|
9108|Kajabbi Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Most of the contacts with older rocks are faulted but some of the contacts of the quartzite near Cabbage Tree Creek and the upper unit of the Mount Albert Group may be unconformable. In diamond drillhole BHP 4, the Cambrian strata appear to overlie the Corella Formation with an angular unconformity. The Cambrian strata are overlain unconformably by Mesozoic sandstone and Cainozoic sediments.|
9108|Kajabbi Formation|Structure and Metamorphism|The Kajabbi Formation generally dips less than 30o but near the Pinnacle Fault dips of 75o to vertical are more typical.|
9108|Kajabbi Formation|Age reasons|A middle Cambrian age was determined from brachiopod and trilobite fossils. Druce (cited in Broken hill Proprietary Co., 1977) correlated specimens from 5 km south of Kajabbi (6957-983797) with the transition between the Inca Formation and the Pomegranate Limestone of the Georgina Basin. Fleming (1978) described a collection of Cambrian agnostid trilobites from 2.5 km south-southwest of Kajabbi (6957-988820). The species recognised were Ptychagnostus cassis, P. nathorsti?, Diplagnostus c.f. humilis, and Pseudophalacroma dubium. This fauna indicates a correlation with the laevigata I Zone (cassis Zone) of Opik (1961), corresponding to the Roaring Siltstone in the northern part of the Burke River Outlier and part of the Devoncourt Limestone in the southern part of the Outlier.|

This locality is the U-Pb zircon age determination site, 79205309. 1 km to the east, the granodiorite intrudes undivided Tewinga Group, whilst 3 km west of the site, the granodiorite is unconformably overlain by Haslingden Group (Blake & others, 1982). The dominant rock type at the lectostratotype is a porphyritic granodiorite containing some mafic xenoliths. The locality is cut by dolerite dykes and aplite veins.|

9136|Kalkadoon Granodiorite|Lithology|The Kalkadoon Granodiorite is medium to coarse-grained and ranges from a K-feldspar-free tonalite, through granodiorite to monzogranite (IUGS nomenclature, Streckeisen, 1973), with granodiorite being the most abundant. Tonalites are even-grained, with K-feldspar forming sparse phenocrysts up to 1 cm long in the more felsic varieties. The more mafic granodiorites are strongly porphyritic, and contain K-feldspar phenocrysts up to 5 cm long. The phenocrysts decrease in abundance from the granodiorite into the monzogranite as the rocks become more even-grained. Most of the Kalkadoon Granodiorite has been regionally metamorphosed, and primary igneous textures are rarely present.|
9136|Kalkadoon Granodiorite|Relationships and boundaries|The Kalkadoon Granodiorite intrudes rocks of the Leichhardt Volcanics, Leichhardt Metamorphics, and undivided Tewinga Group. It is intruded by dolerite, Wills Creek Granite, Woonigan Granite and granophyre. It is unconformably overlain by rocks of the Bottletree Formation, Haslingden Group, and Quilalar and Surprise Creek Formations in the west (Bultitude & others, 1982; Blake & others, 1982; Derrick & others, 1980) and the Magna Lynn Metabasalt, Argylla Formation, and Mary Kathleen Group in the east (Plumb & others, 1980).|
9136|Kalkadoon Granodiorite|Age reasons|Early Proterozoic. A U-Pb zircon age determination of 1856+/-11/9 m.y. was obtained on a sample from the lectostratotype (Page & Wyborn, in press). This is in agreement with a zircon age of 1862+/-27/29 m.y. from samples on MARY KATHLEEN 1:100 000 Shet area. All Rb-Sr age determinations are reset (Page, 1978).|

9136|Kalkadoon Granodiorite|Comments|Remarks - The original definition of Carter & others (1961) for the Kalkadoon Granite was essentially referring to a "geographical entity" in which the granite was "composite, containing rocks of different ages and compositions" (Carter & others, 1961, p.143). Essentially, their definition was that of a granite batholith, i.e., a structural term. However, Carter & others (1961) and Joplin & Walker (1961) noted that the dominant phase within the Kalkaloon Granite was a granodiorite, intrusive into the Leichhardt Metamorphics. The name change proposed here restricts the name Kalkadoon Granodiorite to a particular intrusive phase (aged between 1850 and 1870 m.y.) in which the dominant rock type is granodiorite. Although Derrick & others (1977) recorded a dominance of syenogranite, this result is at variance with the work of Carter & others (1961), Joplin & Walker (1961), and Wyborn & Page (in press). In the last study, rock nomenclature was based on accurate point counts made on 15 x 10 cm stained rock slabs, which, in view of the medium to coarse grain size and sometimes porphyritic rock types, would be more accurate than the estimated modal analyses on 5 x 2 cm thin sections used by Derrick & others (1977). The name Kalkadoon Granite of Carter & others (1961) is essentially synonomous with the structural term, Kalkadoon Batholith of Wyborn & Page (in press). Kalkadoon Batholith now encompasses the proposed Kalkadoon Granodiorite and the One Tree, Woonigan, and Wills Creek Granites of Blake & others (1981).|

Most of the section consists of ridge-forming thin to medium-bedded, medium to coarse-grained, glassy quartzite, feldspathic quartzite, and muscovite quartzite. The section also contains minor hornblende+/- biotite schist and gneiss, at least some of which probably represents metadolerite. No facing evidence has been found in the quartzites.|
24330|Kallala Quartzite|Extent|The Kallala Quartzite forms a narrow N-trending belt in the far S of the central part of the Ardmore 1:100 000 Sheet area, and extends S into the Glenormiston 1:250 000 Sheet area.|
24330|Kallala Quartzite|Thickness range|Unknown, probably at leat 350 m. The formation has been tightly folded and dips are steep to vertical.|
24330|Kallala Quartzite|Lithology|The rocks are generally as in the type section.|
24330|Kallala Quartzite|Relationships and boundaries|The formation appears to have a concordant, probably conformable contact with the Sulieman Gneiss, and, to the west, a concordant, possible conformable, contact with a sequence of schistose amphibolite (metabasalt) and interlayered metasediments tentatively mapped as Jayah Creek Metabasalt. It may be younger then the Sulieman Gneiss and older than the Jayah Creek Metabasalt. The Kallala Quartzite is intruded by the Sybella Granite and by quartz and pegmatite veins.|
24330|Kallala Quartzite|Age reasons|Precambrian.|
24330|Kallala Quartzite|Proposed publication|Blake & others, in preparation|
24330|Kallala Quartzite|Comments|Remarks: Bedding tends in the quartzite are mainly northerly, and dips are moderately steep to vertical. Trend lines and variations in the direction of dip indicate that the sequence has been tightly folded about mainly north to northeast-trrending axes. A northerly trending axial-plane fracture cleavage is well developed in the hinge zones of folds. The sequence has been regionally metamorphosed to amphibolite grade.|

27171|Karana Quartz Diorite|Unit history|Bryan and Jones (1950) informally referred to this body as the Mount Crosby quartz diorite. Gradwell (1958) first published the name Kholo Creek Quartz Diorite and this name was also used by Kirk (1973). However, this name is unacceptable due to the previous usage of the name Kholo by Denmead (1955) in his "Kholo Series" (which was later upgraded in the same sense to Kholo Sub Group by Allen 1961). Cranfield et al. (in press) listed this body under Undifferentiated Triassic Intrusions and used the term "Kholo Creek Quartz Diorite" in parenthesis as an informal name.|

The Karmoo Quartz Diorite is delineated on the Landsat 5 TM (1-4-7 BGR) image by cleared areas that have a yellowish hue. Only the eastern part of the pluton was covered by the geophysical survey. Complex magnetic dipoles characterise this area, but the data suggest that a strong positive anomaly lies over the western half of the pluton. K, Th and U responses are generally low, but higher responses within 3 km of the eastern margin, possibly reflecting the abundant metamorphic enclaves.|

33722|Kenewah Granodiorite|Unit history|This is a new name for a granodiorite body originally mapped as part of the Woolshed Mountain Granodiorite by Cranfield and Schwarzboch (1974).  The RTP magnetic image shows the Kenewah Granodiorite to be a separate body from the main Woolshed Mountain Granodiorite.

33722|Kenewah Granodiorite|Type section locality|A type area for the Kenewah Granodiorite is the valley containing the headwaters of the eastern branch of Granite Creek.  In this valley scattered tors of light grey medium to coarse-grained granodiorite occur adjacent to the road.  Examples of the granite can also be found beside the road in the headwaters of the eastern branch of Oaky Creek.|30/NOV/09
33722|Kenewah Granodiorite|Extent|The Kenewah Granodiorite is located in the southeastern bottom corner of KINGAROY in the headwaters of the eastern branch of Oaky Creek and eastern branch of Granite Creek.

33722|Kenewah Granodiorite|Geophysical Expression|Magnetic response was used to distinguish the Kenewah Granodiorite from the Woolshed Mountain Granodiorite on the RTP magnetic image.  The moderate magnetic response shown by the Kenewah Granodiorite contrasts sharply with the very low response of the Woolshed Mountain Granodiorite.  The subsurface body is approximately 19km2 in area and is elongated in a south-westerly direction.  Contrast on the RGBI (total count as intensity layer) radiometric image is also substantial with the Kenewah Granodiorite giving a `hot¿ (white) response whereas the Woolshed Mountain Granodiorite has a reddish signature.|07/FEB/11

24344|Korenan Oil Shale Member|Unit history|Part of the Lowmead Beds of Cribb, 1960; Mack, 1972; and Ellis and Whitaker, 1976.|
24344|Korenan Oil Shale Member|Type section locality|135.2 m (estimated true thickness 133.2 m) from 78.4 m to 213.6 m in LDD14 (GR 64906E 95222N Miriam Vale 1:000 000 Sheet area). The interval is within the type section of the Lowmead Formation. Dark to dusky yellow-brown kerogenous claystone (oil shale) is the dominant rock type (greater than 90%). Upper and lower boundaries are identified by the contact of brown oil shale with black carbonaceous oil shale of the Makowata Oil Shale Member and Wheatley Oil Shale Member, respectively.|
24344|Korenan Oil Shale Member|Extent|Subcrops in an area of about 7 km2 north and east of Korenan railway siding. Sparse mostly weathered outcrops are known. The member has been identified from drill core.|
24344|Korenan Oil Shale Member|Thickness range|135.2 m in type section. True thickness 133.2 m, corrected for a 10o dip of the strata in LDD14. The member ranges in thickness from 94.3 m to 149.7 m.|
24344|Korenan Oil Shale Member|Lithology|There are two types of oil shale, identified by lithological changes and confirmed by comparison of assay histogram of oil yields. The boundary between the two types is determined from the assay histogram. The lower oil shale is hard, very thinly laminated dusky yellow-brown. There are sporadic carbonaceous oil shale beds up to 2 m thick. On an assay histogram of oil yield the average yield is above 50 litres of shale oil per tonne of oil shale at zero percent moisture (LTOM). The upper oil shale is moderately hard, massive to laminated and dark to dusky yellow-brown. There are sporadic thin (less than 30 cm) very hard sideritic argillite beds. Traces of bioturbation (annelid grazing tracks) are present. The average oil yield is below 50 LTOM.|
24344|Korenan Oil Shale Member|Relationships and boundaries|The Korenan Oil Shale Member is conformably overlain by the Makowata Oil Shale Member and conformably overlies the Wheatley Oil Shale Member of the Lowmead Formation.

10002|Lady Loretta Formation|Unit history|The rocks now included in the Lady Loretta Formation were included in the Paradise Creek Formation and Ploughed Mountain Beds by Carter & others (1961).|
10002|Lady Loretta Formation|Type section locality|Holostratotype: 10 km northeast of Thorntonia homestead between GR 923500 (base) and GR898500 in the Mount Oxide 1:100 000 Sheet area. The section lies due east of the Burketown-Camooweal road; its top is 2 km east of the road while its base is 500 m east of the Thornton River. The holostratotype comprises a basal sequence of ferruginous and altered laminated and stromatolitic dolomite, overlain by a less latered sequence of laminated and intraclast dolomite stromatolitic dolomite and possible tuff which in turn is overlain by a thin band of green and mauve indurated siltstone and shale. Interbedded laminated and intraclast dolomite overlain by medium bedded, flaggy, sporadically dolomitic sandstone complete the sequence in the holostratotype.  Hypostratotype: 5 km south of Lady Annie mine, northeasterly for 5 km to the Lady Loretta mine (953068 (base) to 975129 (top)) in the Mammoth Mines 1:100 000 Sheet area. The lithologies in this section are different to those in the Holostratotype and comprise variably pyritic, dolomitic and carbonaceous shale and siltstone with minor sandstone, quartzite, dolarenite, chert, barite, tuff and bedded silver-lead-zinc deposits.|
10002|Lady Loretta Formation|Extent|The northernmost outcrops of the unit are in the cores of the Mount Caroline and Ploughed Mountain anticlines in the Mount Oscar Lawn Hill 1:100 000 Sheet areas. The unit is best exposed around the Kamaraga dome and in several anticlines and synclines in the Lawn Hill and Riversleigh 1:100 000 Sheet areas. It crops out as a long narrow, sometimes tightly folded, belt which extends through Riversleigh, Mount Oxide, Mammoth Mines and Undilla 1:100 000 Sheet areas and which includes the Lady Loretta syncline; and it forms isolated outcrops in the Mammoth Mines, Kennedy Gap and Yelvertoft 1:100 000 Sheet areas.|
10002|Lady Loretta Formation|Thickness range|The formation is 1800 m thick in the holostratotype but less than 600 m in the hypostratotype. The thickest development is in the Lawn Hill 1:100 000 Sheet area where over 2000 m is exposed, and in general the unit thins southward.|
10002|Lady Loretta Formation|Lithology|Apart from the area around the hypostratotype, the lithologies in the holostratotype are typical of those throughout the outcrop area. The ferruginous and cherty breccia at the base of the formation grades into a cyclic sequence of alternating high spire Conophyton beds and cream laminated dolomite and "cauliflower chert" beds.|
10002|Lady Loretta Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The unit conformably overlies the Esperanza Formation and is conformably overlain by the Shady Bore Quartzite. The basal contact is sharp and is commonly marked by a ferruginous breccia overlying massive chert beds. The upper boundary is gradational and is placed where massive orthoquartzite beds form more than 25 per cent of the sequence.|

10047|Lake Galilee Sandstone|Thickness range|263 m in the type section; 145m+ and 84 m thick, in GSQ Jericho 2 and AOD Jericho 1 respectively. The unit is present but its limits are not clearly defined in FPN Koburra 1.|
10047|Lake Galilee Sandstone|Lithology|Silicified sandstone with minor amounts of mudstone in the upper part. Cores 31 to 35 inclusive were cut in the type section and are described in detail by Pemberton in Exoil N.L. (1965). Sandstone is light to medium grey, very fine to medium, generally well sorted and quartzose. It consists of subround to angular quartz grains in a quartz cement. Conglomeratic bands are present, containing rounded pebbles of quartz, quartzite, chert, and intraformational clasts. Mudstone is dark grey to black, fissile and locally interbedded with light to dark grey, argillaceous, siliceous siltstone; silicification is secondary.|

25986|Lakeview Dolerite|Name source|Lakeview mine (M.L. 5720, Cloncurry Mining District) 8 km southeast of Mary Kathleen, Latitude 20o50'S, Longitude 140o1'25"E (6956 985958) is approximately 200 m east of the largest dyke of this Dolerite.|
25986|Lakeview Dolerite|Geomorphic expression|The Lakeview Dolerite forms elongate valleys containing deep soil, scattered well-rounded dolerite boulders and rare rock pavements. Country rocks adjacent to the dykes are in many places more elevated than the surrounding exposures of these rocks.|
25986|Lakeview Dolerite|Type section locality|A boulder strewn pavement 500 m north of Lakeview mine exposes a typical section of the main dyke, which is 35 km long and up to 150 m thick.|
25986|Lakeview Dolerite|Extent|Dolerite which shows no evidence of regional metamorphism and which occurs as east to northeast-trending dykes is assigned to the Lakeview Dolerite. Dykes of this dolerite occur in the Mary Kathleen and the western part of the Marraba 1:100 000 Sheet areas. Some dykes in the surrounding Sheet areas are probably of the same type and age but until more extensive radiometric dating is done on these bodies they have been mapped as undivided dolerite dykes. The main dyke extends from Ballara, 18 km south of Mary Kathleen, northeastwards for about 35 km towards Corella Park homestead.|
25986|Lakeview Dolerite|Thickness range|The dykes of this dolerite range from approximately 10 to 50 m thick.|
25986|Lakeview Dolerite|Lithology|The dolerite typically has fine-grained margins of intersertal textured dolerite and a medium to coarse-grained core of ophitic textured dolerite. The dolerite contains two pyroxenes, abundant hornblende and some biotite. Irregular patches of alteration to chlorite and serpentine are thought to have resulted from autometamorphism.|
25986|Lakeview Dolerite|Relationships and boundaries|The Lakeview Dolerite intrudes the Corella Formation, the Lunch Creek Gabbro and the Burstall Granite. Because the Dolerite is virtually undeformed it is thought to have been intruded after the main period of folding in the layered Middle Proterozoic rocks.|
25986|Lakeview Dolerite|Age reasons|Green (1975) obtained a potassium/argon biotite date on the Lakeview Dolerite of 1380 m.y. A rubidium/strontium age of 116+/-12 m.y. has been obtained by Page (1975, pers. comm.).|
25986|Lakeview Dolerite|Comments|Discussion: This un;it has been shown by radiometric dating to be one of the youngest Precambrian units in northwestern Queensland. Dykes of this age are designated do6 on the 1:100 000 Preliminary Geological Maps. The Lakeview Dolerite was definitely post-tectonic and was intruded after cooling of the country rock.|

24353|Lane Creek Formation|Name source|Lane Creek, a tributary of Fiery Creek which it joins at GR 581075 (Forest Home 1:100 000 Sheet area).|
24353|Lane Creek Formation|Geomorphic expression|The Lane Creek Formation forms relatively subdued relief, but bedding trends have been picked out by differential weathering and erosion in places. On coloured aerial photographs, the formation is characterised by a greyish tone due to the abundant carbonaceous rocks; calc-silicate rocks within the formation give rise to reddish soils.|
24353|Lane Creek Formation|Type section locality|The holostratotype is along the Robertson River for about 2 km between the QWRC stream gauging station at GR484233 (base) and 471251 (top) (North Head 1:100 000 Sheet area). A maximum of 2500 m is exposed but the thickness is likely to be considerably less because of repetition by minor folds. Variably carbonaceous, cleaved mudstone, siltstone, and minor fine-grained sandstone are exposed. Withnall & Mackenzie (1980) designated this section as a reference section (hypostratotype) of the Robertson River Formation (now Subgroup). Reference section: more highly metamorphosed rocks are eaxposed along the Forsayth-Agate Creek road for about 17 km between GR 605232 and 636350 (North Head 1:100 000 Sheet area), and area designated as a parastratotype of the Lane Creek Formation. The rocks consist of mica schist, carbonaceous phyllite and schist, quartzite, and minor calc-silicate rocks.|
24353|Lane Creek Formation|Extent|The main outcrop area is a broad sinuous belt extending northwest from the Ropewalk Range to near Huonfels homestead and then northeast to the Newcastle Range. Smaller areas occur in the North Head 1:100 000 Sheet area between Mount jClarke and Mount Johnstone, and near Malcolms Creek and Dry Pocket. The total area of the formation is about 2000 km2.|
24353|Lane Creek Formation|Thickness range|The thickness of the Lane Creek Formation is indeterminate in most areas because of the complex deformation. However, in the western part of the area, where the structure is less complex, the formation is 1000 to 2000 m thick.|
24353|Lane Creek Formation|Lithology|The Lane Creek Formation consists of cleaved, variably carbonaceous mudstone, siltstone and fine-grained sericitic to quartzose sandstone, and local calcareous siltstone and impure limestone; these grade eastwards into their metamorphic equivalents. The metamorphic grade ranges from greenschist to upper amphibolite facies.|
24353|Lane Creek Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The Lane Creek Formation is the uppermost unit of the Robertson River Subgroup. It conformably overlies the Corbett Formation, from which it is distinguished by its abundant carbonaceous rocks. In some places (including the type section), resistant ridge-forming green mudstone occurs at the top of the Corbett Formation, and marks its upper boundary. The Lane Creek Formation is overlain conformably by the Townley Formation, and the boundary is recognised by the change from the predominant carbonaceous rocks to white and pale grey siltstone, and fine-grained quartzose sandstone. The Townley Formation is also topographically more prominent than the Lane Creek Formation, and has a lighter tone on aerial photographs. The Lane Creek Formation is intruded by sills of Cobbold Metadolerite as well as by various Proterozoic granitoid plutons, late Palaeozoic hypabyssal rocks, and the Permian Yataga Granodiorite. It is overlain unconformably by various late Palaeozoic volcanic units, and the Jurassic Hampstead Sandstone.|
24353|Lane Creek Formation|Age reasons|The minimum age of 1570+/-20 Ma (mid-Proterozoic) obtained for the Etheridge Group, also applies to the Lane Creek Formation.|

27818|Langdon River Mudstone|Lithology|Variation: Withnall & Mackenzie (1980) redefined White's (1959) 'Langdon River Formation' as 'Langdon River Siltstone'. The rocks were incorrectly classified in the field as siltstone, and are in fact predominantly mudstone. We therefore propose that the name be varied to Langdon River Mudstone.|

28247|Langlovale Group|Unit history|Rocks of the Langlovale Group were considered to be part of either the 'Langdon River Formation' or the 'Etheridge Formation' by White (1965).|
28247|Langlovale Group|Constituents|Yarman Formation underlain by Malacura Sandstone (defined by Withnall & Mackenzie (1980)).|
28247|Langlovale Group|Extent|Exposed along most of the valley of the Langdon River, from 7460*-070140 north to the Gilbert River; small outliers crop out on the northern side of the Gilbert River near 'Forest Home' homestead (around 7561*-135800) and near 'Boomerang Swamp', around 7461*-800025.|
28247|Langlovale Group|Thickness range|Variable; up to at least 3200 m.|
28247|Langlovale Group|Lithology|Dark grey (weathering to red-brown) shale, mudstone, and siltstone with 5-10% 10 mm to 1 m-thick interbeds of cross-laminated sandstone (Yarman Formation); fine to medium feldspathic, commonly micaceous sublithic to quartzose sandstone, siltstone, silty sandstone, sandy siltstone, and dark grey shale; minor carbonaceous quartzose mudstone and very coarse sublithic sandstone; sandstones predominant (Malacura Sandstone).|
28247|Langlovale Group|Relationships and boundaries|Unconformably overlies Etheridge Group (Withnall & Mackenzie, 1980); in places unconformably overlain by, in others faulted against Croydon Volcanics; intruded by Esmeralda Granite and possibly by Forest Home Granodiorite; unconformably overlain by Mesozoic sandstones.    *1:100 0000 Sheet areas - see continuation card.|
28247|Langlovale Group|Age reasons|Probably Middle Proterozoic; underlying rocks have been affected by deformation and metamorphism, dated at 1570+/-20 m.y. (Black & others, 1979), which do not affect the Langlovale Group; the Group is overlain by Croydon Volcanics dated at 1429+/-75 m.y. (Black, 1973).|

22167|Larramore Metabasalt Member|Name source|The member is named after Larramore Creek, a major tributary of the North Palmer River in southeastern LAURA.|
22167|Larramore Metabasalt Member|Geomorphic expression|Chert lenses in the Larramore Metabasalt Member are resistant to erosion and tend to form steep-sided narrow ridges.  Deeply incised and rugged country is developed on the member in the north, where the local relief commonly exceeds 100 m.  A maximum relief of 400 m is attained in the Mount Hann area.  Mount Hann has an elevation of 712 m and Woods Peak, to the south, an elevation of 751 m and a local relief of about 200 m (Royal Australian Survey Corps, 1982).   The chert lenses generally show pale tones on aerial photographs.  Mafic volcanics crop out poorly and are characterised by dark tones.  Weathering of the volcanics has resulted in the extensive development of a thin red-brown ferruginous soil cover.|
22167|Larramore Metabasalt Member|Type section locality|The designated type area is in and adjacent to the Palmer River upstream of its junction with Granite Creek (in MAYTOWN).  The river cuts across bedding trends at high angles and the sequence is well exposed.|
22167|Larramore Metabasalt Member|Extent|The member forms a prominent northwest to northeast-trending belt, up to 3 km wide.  This belt extends from the upper reaches of Chinky Creek (in southern LAURA) 30 km south to the abandoned Cannibal Creek tin mine (in central-eastern MAYTOWN).  Farther to the southwest, in the Mount Madden - Stony Creek area, the member outlines a structural dome about 25 km in circumference.  The sequence is intensely deformed in this area and extensively disrupted.|
22167|Larramore Metabasalt Member|Thickness range|The thickness of the member is uncertain because of extensive deformation and the likelihood of repetition of parts of the sequence by difficult-to-detect bed-parallel thrust faults.  The member has a maximum outcrop width of about 3000 m.|
22167|Larramore Metabasalt Member|Lithology|The sequence exposed in the type area consists mainly of metabasalt lava flows with numerous interlayered chert lenses ranging from about 2 m to 20 m thick, and minor greywacke, mudstone, and tuffaceous(?) sediments.  In the North Palmer River, to the north, the eastern (oldest?) part of the member consists of a relatively thick sequence of metabasalt lava flows.  Chert lenses are concentrated in the western part of the unit; they are not as common as in the Palmer River section.  The western part of the North Palmer River section also contains some interlayered, strongly cleaved phyllitic mudstone and fine-grained greywacke, which is mapped as part of the undivided Hodgkinson Formation.  The metabasalts in the belt north of Cannibal Creek are dark grey to greenish grey and extensively recrystallised to fine to medium-grained aggregates of mainly tremolite/ actinolite, clinozoisite/epidote, and albite.  Minor and accessory minerals (not all present in every sample) include calcite, quartz (characterised by highly irregular grain boundaries and undulose extinction), sphene/leucoxene, sericite/muscovite, pyrite and chlorite (colourless or, rarely, very pale green).  The minerals show no obvious preferred orientation except in samples from or adjacent to major shear zones (e.g., at GR 2199 82322).  The metabasalts examined from this belt show only poorly preserved or, more rarely, no relict igneous textures.  Porphyritic textures are the most common.  Scarce, turbid, extensively altered groundmass grains (up to about 1.5 mm long) and phenocrysts (up to 6 mm long) of calcic plagioclase are present in many samples.  The plagioclase grains are replaced mainly by albite(?), sericite/muscovite, clinozoisite/epidote and calcite.  Metabasalt from the summit of Mount Bennett shows a relict porphyritic texture but is atypical compared with the other samples examined in that the calcite grains are relatively coarse (0.3 mm - 1.5 mm long) - most appear to be pseudomorphing clinopyroxene (as mainly subhedral, tabular grains).  The metabasalts are mainly massive but amygdaloidal zones are present locally (e.g., at GR 2205 82326, in the North Palmer River).  Very few, if any primary structures and textures are preserved in the mafic volcanics exposed in the structural dome southwest of Cannibal Creek, due to extensive deformation and recrystallisation.  The metabasalts are commonly cut by thin veinlets of quartz +/- clinozoisite/epidote (zoned) +/- chlorite, and of calcite +/- quartz +/- clinozoisite/epidote +/- chlorite +/- muscovite.  Vuggy quartz veins up to 30 cm thick also cut the sequence in Granite Creek.  The cherts are white, pale brown to dark red-brown, grey, olive green or black, and fine grained; the radiolarian probably originated from the deposition of primary siliceous oozes...The interlayered siliciclastic sediments consist mainly of pale brown, pale to dark grey, or black phyllitic mudstone and brown or grey, fine to medium-grained greywack|07/FEB/11
22167|Larramore Metabasalt Member|Relationships and boundaries|The Larramore Metabasalt Member forms a prominent marker unit in the Hodgkinson Formation in the eastern part of MAYTOWN and adjoining LAURA to the north.  Amos & de Keyser (1964), Lucas & de Keyser (1965), and de Keyser & Lucas (1968) included the rocks of the Larramore Metabasalt Member in the Hodgkinson Formation.  The member is concordant with the enclosing siliciclastic metasediments of the Hodgkinson Formation.  It is therefore tentatively interpreted to conformably overlie and to be conformably overlain by siliciclastic sediments of the Hodgkinson Formation.  Nevertheless the member is bounded and cut by prominent broken-formation zones in the north.  The member may be extensively disrupted internally by low-angle or bed-parallel thrust faults.  The member is cut by numerous thin (generally <3 cm thick) quartz veins and scattered dolerite dykes.|
22167|Larramore Metabasalt Member|Structure and Metamorphism|The metabasalts commonly show a weak to prominent tectonic foliation.  The foliation is most intensely developed southwest of Cannibal Creek tin mine, in the Mount Madden - Stonyville area, where the rocks are generally characterised by a prominent platy fabric.  The sequence in this area outlines a broad structural dome about 25 km in circumference, but on a detailed scale the rocks are intensely folded and faulted.   The cherts are generally extensively deformed; mesoscopic folds are common north and south of Cannibal Creek tin mine and they generally show a well-developed foliation.  The foliation is most intensely developed in the Mount Madden - Stonyville area.  A cross-cutting crenulation cleavage is also commonly strongly developed in this area and foliation planes are generally characterised by a prominent down-dip mineral streaking/intersection lineation.   Farther north, in the North Palmer River, the cherts also show a well-developed foliation sub-parallel to bedding.  Stylolites are locally well developed at contacts between individual beds.  The associated fine-grained metasediments are generally strongly cleaved and in places show a well-developed cross-cutting crenulation cleavage.  The Larramore Metabasalt Member has been regionally metamorphosed to the lower greenschist facies.  Relict igneous textures are poorly preserved in the metabasalts, most of which contain abundant tremolite/actinolite and albite.  Fine metamorphic biotite is relatively common in the interlayered siliciclastic sediments.  The most extensively recrystallised and highest grade rocks occur in the structural dome southwest of Cannibal Creek tin mine.  This may indicate the presence of a granite (sensu lato) at relatively shallow depths.  Granite has been intersected in several holes drilled near the Keddy tungsten mine (abandoned) to the northeast (McConnell & Carver, 1984).  Furthermore, hornfelsed phyllitic rocks containing altered andalusite porphyroblasts are poorly exposed in the area around Buchanan's mine (McConnell & Carver, 1985).  Poorly exposed muscovite-schist containing scattered chlorite porphyroblasts was also found in the same area during the current survey.  The only other known occurrences of schist in the Hodgkinson Formation are in the metamorphic aureole surrounding the Cannibal Creek Granite.  McConnell & Carver (1985) also reported hornfelsed phyllite near Mount Madden.|07/FEB/11
22167|Larramore Metabasalt Member|Age reasons|No diagnostic fossils have been found in the member and its age is therefore uncertain.  It is thought to be most probably Devonian.|

The formation is subdivided into six subunits, two of which are formally defined as members in this paper, and four of which remain informal. The subunits are: Subunit 6: 80 m + green siltstone, shale and minor sandstone (top); Subunit 5 - Widdallion Sandstone Member: 550 m friable, reddish brown to cream lithic, feldspathic arenite; Subunit 4: 850 m tuff and siltstone with minor sandstone, shale, dolomite and acid volcanics; Subunit 3: Bulmung Sandstone Member: 40 m lithic sandstone and intraclast conglomerate; Subunit 2: 80 m thin to medium bedded green tuff, siltstone and minor sandstone and shale; Subunit 1: 220 m concretionary grey weathering shale and black carbonaceous shale.|
10261|Lawn Hill Formation|Extent|The Lawn Hill Formation crops out from the Gregory River 6 km west of Riversleigh homestead to Accident Creek 20 km east of Bowthorn homestead. It extends eastward to Archie Creek and has been mapped in the Carrara-Mitchiebo area in the Northern Territory.|
10261|Lawn Hill Formation|Thickness range|Approximately 1800 m of sediment are present in the hypostratotype of the Lawn Hill Formation, and a similar thickness is exposed in the Carrara Range region of the Northern Territory.|
10261|Lawn Hill Formation|Lithology|The unit is characterised by the presence of a basal black shale overlain by a tuffaceous and silty sequence which is capped by the ferruginous friable sandstone of the Widdallion Sandstone Member. In the western part of the Lawn Hill Sheet area, a thin but prominent sandstone bed (Bulmung Sandstone Member) occurs in the lower part of the tuff and siltstone sequence and some siltstone and shale crop out above the Widdallion Sandstone Member.|
10261|Lawn Hill Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The Lawn Hill Formation conformably overlies the Termite Range Formation in the Lawn Hill 1:100 000 Sheet area. In the Carrara and Mitchiebo 1:100 000 Sheet areas it conformably overlies the Musselbrook Formation. Throughout the outcrop area it is overlain unconformably by the Carpentarian South Nicholson Group or by the Cambrian limestones of the Georgina Basin.|
10261|Lawn Hill Formation|Age reasons|Mid-Proterozoic (Carpentarian).|
28675|Leichhardt Volcanics|Name source|Named after the Leichhardt River (Carter & others, 1961).|
28675|Leichhardt Volcanics|Unit history|Mapped as part of the Leichhardt Metamorphics by Carter & Opik (1963).|
28675|Leichhardt Volcanics|Type section locality|The type section for the Leichhardt Metamorphics is in the Prospector 1:100 000 Sheet area, Cloncurry 1:250 000 Sheet area, extending west from the Referee copper mine (GR 797531) for about 8 km to the gorge on Doughboy Creek (GR 718524): here metamorphosed felsic volcanics of the Leichhardt Metamorphics are extensively intruded by granite and dolerite dykes (Carter & others, 1961; Derrick & others, 1976). Reference Section:  Along the Dajarra/The Monument road E of Wills Creek, from GR 670840, 24 km ES of Dajarra, east for 7 km, to GR 740890, Dajarra 1:100 000 Sheet area, Duchess 1:250 000 Sheet area. In this section pink to grey felsic volcanics containing quartz and feldspar phenocrysts, the characteristic rock types of the unit, are exposed, together with a thin sandstone bed (in the W) and minor feldspar porphyry, and are seen to be intruded by leucocratic Wills Creek Granite (new name) and dolerite. The volcanics here form undulating terrain.|
28675|Leichhardt Volcanics|Extent|In the Duchess 1:250 000 Sheet area the formation crops out in a series of N-trending belts up to 6 km wide extending from the northern border of the Duchess 1:100 000 Sheet area south to the southern border of the Dajarra 1:100 000 Sheet area. It also crops out extensively in sheet areas to the north where it has been mapped as Leichhardt Metamorphics (Carter & others, 1961; Derrick & others, 1976).|
28675|Leichhardt Volcanics|Thickness range|Unknown, but probably more than 1000 m.|
28675|Leichhardt Volcanics|Lithology|As mapped in the Duchess 1:250 000 Sheet area the Leichhardt Volcanics consist mainly of massive rhyolitic volcanics containing quartz and feldspar phenocrysts enclosed in a very fine-grained groundmass commonly showing primary igneous textures; most of the volcanics appear to be ignimbrites, but some flow-banded lavas are also present; minor rock types present locally include feldspar porphyry, volcaniclastic sandstone, bedded tuff, and altered basaltic volcanics; at only a few localities are the volcanic rocks regionally metamorphosed to form foliated and schistose rocks.|
28675|Leichhardt Volcanics|Relationships and boundaries|The formation, Leichhardt Volcanics, is overlain disconformably by Magna Lynn Metabasalt and unconformably by Makbat Sandstone and Stanbroke Sandstone (new name). It overlies One Tree Granite and is intruded by Wills Creek, Birds Well and Woonigan Granite (all new names) and mafic dykes. Its relationship to adjacent Kalkadoon Granite and gneissic metavolcanics mapped as undivided Tewinga Group is uncertain.|
28675|Leichhardt Volcanics|Identifying features|Definition: Revision of Leichhardt Metamorphics (Carter & others, 1961; Derrick & others, 1976) - change in lithologic designation for this formation in the Duchess 1:250 000 Sheet area.|
28675|Leichhardt Volcanics|Age reasons|Early Proterozoic; samples from the Duchess 1:250 000 Sheet area have been isotopically dated at 1870-1880 m.y. by R W Page (personal communication, 1980) using the U-Pb zircon method. This age is similar to the 1865+/-3 m.y. age given by the Leichhardt Metamorphics to the north (Page, 1978).|
28675|Leichhardt Volcanics|Comments|Remarks:  The Leichhardt Volcanics is equivalent to all or most of the Leichhardt Metamorphics mapped in sheet areas to the north, hence is part of the Tewinga Group of Derrick & others (1976). In the Duchess 1:250 000 Sheet area, the unit consists predominantly of readily recognisable felsic volcanic rocks, not metamorphic rocks. To designate the formation 'metamorphics' is misleading, in that almost all other stratigraphic un;its in the southern part of the Mount Isa Inlier are either equally metamorphic or more so. Also, a term such as 'metamorphics' conceals the essential volcanic nature of the unit. Clearly, the name Leichhardt Volcanics is more informative than Leichhardt Metamorphics and is an accurate lithologic description for the formation in the Duchess 1:250 000 Sheet area. Outcrop belts containing extensively recrystallised and gneissic felsic volcanics to the west in the Duchess 1:250 000 Sheet area, previously mapped as Leichhardt Metamorphics (Carter & Opik, 1963) but now mapped as undivided Tewinga Group, may include metamorphosed equivalents of the Leichhardt Volcanics.|

In the type section the base is defined by the contact between calcareous metasediments and a basaltic flow. Pillow structures are common in zones up to 50 m thick towards the base of the member and are well exposed in pavements in Cameron River; amygdaloidal metabasalt is also common in this section. The top of the unit is marked byh the change from metabasalt to calcareous metasediments. The east-facing jof the unit has been determined from the pillow structures.|

24360|Littleton Dacite Member|Name source|The name is derived from 'Littleton' Holding, Parishes of Dirie, Guela and Awring, County of Langlo, covering much of the drainage areas of Rosella, Twenty :Mile, and Maitland Creeks, and Little River.|
24360|Littleton Dacite Member|Unit history|The Littleton Dacite Member was previously an undifferentiated part of the Croydon Volcanics of Branch (1966); it was informally named 'Littleton dacite member' and described by Mackenzie (1983).|
24360|Littleton Dacite Member|Geomorphic expression|The Littleton Dacite Member has characteristically formed relatively low, subdued to flat topography, with a slightly darker soil colour and slightly denser vegetation cover than the adjoining Carron and Idalia Rhyolites.|
24360|Littleton Dacite Member|Type section locality|The type section extends from GR 7461-735027 (base), along a tributary of Little River to -720025 (top), and consists of dark green-grey, fine to coarse-grained, crystal-poor to crystal-lithic-rich dacitic ignimbrite about 150 m thick. Its base is a conformable contact with medium to dark grey, fine-grained, crystal poor rhyolitic ignimbrite (Carron Rhyolite), and the top is marked by a conformable(?) contact with massive, green-grey, medium-grained, moderately crystal-rich rhyolitic ignimbrite (Idalia Rhyolite).|
24360|Littleton Dacite Member|Extent|The unit crops out in two main areas: one is a belt about 10 km long and up to 1 km wide extending northwestward from Poleycow Creek (about GR 7461-750020); the other is an irregularly shaped inlier, about 5 km2, at the head of Ross Creek, 3 km west of Dinner Camp Waterhole (Little River; GR 7461-860650). An area of outcrop too small to show at 1:100 000 or 1:250 000 scale is located near Mount Angus, 3 km northeast of Croydon.|
24360|Littleton Dacite Member|Thickness range|Dacitic rocks in the Poleycow Creek area are arrpximately 150-200 m thick, but there is abundant evidence of faulting at the upper contact and within the sequence, so this may not be a true thickness. It was not possible to estimate thickness at other localities.|
24360|Littleton Dacite Member|Lithology|Rocks in the Poleycow Creek area are dark greenish-grey, intensely altered (chlorite, sericite, epidote, 'leucoxene', calcite) dacitic ignimbrites, ranging from fine-grained and crystal-poor to coarse-grained (up to several cm) crystal-lithic-rich types, and a moderately crystal-rich dacitic pyroclastic rock, possibly a tuff. Outcrop in the Ross Creek area is altered, fine-grained, sparsely porphyritic, biotite hornblende dacite or microgranodiorite intrusive. The outcrop near Mount Angus is an altered, crystal-poor, dacitic ignimbrite.|
24360|Littleton Dacite Member|Relationships and boundaries|The unit is a Member of the Carron Rhyolite, and occurs sporadically at the top of this formation, conformably(?) overlain by the Idalia Rhyolite.

23733|Llandillo Granite|Geomorphic expression|The granite forms moderate relief. It is well exposed with numerous scattered platforms or boulder-sized outcrops.   On the Landsat 5 TM (1-4-7 BGR) image, the Llandillo Granite can be distinguished from the adjacent Annmore Quartz Monzodiorite and Kilmarnock Granodiorite by its bluish white colour. In the magnetic data, it is readily distinguished from the surrounding Kilmarnock Granodiorite as a circular magnetic low. However, it is radiometrically indistinguishable from the Kilmarnock Granodiorite, which in this area, has similar high K and Th and moderate U responses.|

23733|Llandillo Granite|Relationships and boundaries|Lies along the boundary between the Annmore Quartz Monzodiorite and the Kilmarnock Granodiorite, and probably intruded these plutons. Surrounding the Llandillo Granite are small bodies (up to 1 km2) of similar rock type that appear to intrude the Annmore Quartz Monzodiorite and Kilmarnock Granodiorite.|

25171|Llewellyn Creek Formation|Geomorphic expression|The more siliceous strata in this formation form high ranges of rounded hills, which in places are capped by mesas of lateritized Mesozoic sediments; rugged silicified ridges occur along faults and shear zones. The major drainage pattern appears to be superimposed whereas the minor tributaries are mostly subsequent.|
25171|Llewellyn Creek Formation|Type section locality|The proposed type section is the western end of the section which was used by Carter et al. (1961) in defining the Soldiers Cap Formation. It is about 30 km southeast of Cloncurry and extends for 4.5 km from the core of a major anticline near Snake Creek (East Branch) at latitude 20o56'40"S, longitude 140o39'50"E (7056 651842) to a point 800 m southeast of the Mountain Home (Mount Norna) mine at latitude 20o55'20"S, longitude 140o42'10"E (7056 690862). This section contains approximately 2000 m of the formation but does not expose its base; lower stratigraphic levels of this formation are not known. The section contains from west to east, i.e. from oldest to youngest, 1000 m of arenaceous and pelitic garnet-andalusite schist; two meta-dolerite sills separated by about 200 m of garnet schist; and about 700 m of garnet-staurolite schist, pelitic and arenaceous schist, containing at least two thin intercalations of amphibolitic metabasalt.|
25171|Llewellyn Creek Formation|Extent|The Llewellyn Creek Formation is exposed in a belt up to 30 km wide that extends for 100 km in a south-southeasterly direction from a point about 20 km southeast of Cloncurry. The formation has been mapped in detail in the Cloncurry 1:100 000 Sheet area (Glikson & Derrick, 1970) where it covers about 125 km2, and occupies anticlinal cores near Snake Creek, and the Williams River 13 km to the east. It continues south into the Mount Angelay 1:100 000 Sheet area and probably extends into the Selwyn 1:100 000 Sheet area.|
25171|Llewellyn Creek Formation|Thickness range|The formation is at least 2000 m thick. Glikson & Derrick (1970) record a thickness of 2200 in the headwaters of Sandy Creek, i.e. near latitude 21oS, longitude 140o43'E.|
25171|Llewellyn Creek Formation|Lithology|Well-bedded, graded and laminated phyllite, pelitic schist, metagreywacke, metasiltstone and minor pebbly beds. The metamorphic minerals developed include almandine, sillimanite, anthophyllite, andalusite, staurolite, biotite and muscovite (Glikson, 1972).|
25171|Llewellyn Creek Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The base of the Llewellyn Creek Formation is not exposed and no older rocks are known in this part of the Cloncurry Complex. The formation is overlain conformably by the Mount Norna Quartzite and is overlain unconformably by the Corella Formation and Mesozoic sediments.

25171|Llewellyn Creek Formation|Comments|Remarks: Honman (1939) referred to these rocks as the Lower or Schist stage of the Soldiers Cap series. Glikson (1972) used an informal stratigraphic term, the Snake Creek metaturbidites, for this unit. This name is invalid because the geographic term Snake Creek was pre-empted by Snake Creek Mudstone Member - a Triassic unit validly defined by Hogetoorn (1970). The Llewellyn Creek Formation may be a time equivalent of the mainly acid volcanic Argylla Formation to the west.|

24361|Loafers Granodiorite|Extent|Elongate intrusion about 10 km2 in area, cropping out south of the Bagstowe Ring Dyke Complex mainly in the headwaters of Loafers Creek, Horse Creek and their tributaries; it has an irregular embayed margin and contains some large roof pendants of Einasleigh Metamorphics.|
24361|Loafers Granodiorite|Lithology|As at the type locality; locally slightly porphyritic with sparse pink K-feldspar megacrysts; a very weak foliation is locally present but generally the rocks appear to be unfoliated.|
24361|Loafers Granodiorite|Relationships and boundaries|Intrudes the Proterozoic Einasleigh Metamorphics and intruded by a micro-granodiorite ring dyke which is part of the Carboniferous Bagstowe Ring Dyke Complex. In contact with the Dumbano Granite and Anning Granite but its relationship with these units is not known because of poor exposure.|
24361|Loafers Granodiorite|Age reasons|Age is uncertain. It probably post-dates the second deformation in the area as it is only weakly foliated. Probably late Proterozoic or Silurian-Devonian like the Dumbano Granite, Anning Granite and Robin Hood Granodiorite, but a Carboniferous age is also possible as it shows some similarities to the Culba Granodiorite.|

10574|Lockup Well Limestone|Name source|Lockup Well, at 7859-758664.  The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.|19/MAR/08
10574|Lockup Well Limestone|Unit history|The limestone was shown as 'D' lens of the Broken River Formation by White (1965), and was defined as a member of the Broken River Formation (now Group) by Jell (1968).  It was raised to formation status by Withnall & others (1988), but was not redefined.|
10574|Lockup Well Limestone|Geomorphic expression|Generally low relief with low limestone outcrops.|
10574|Lockup Well Limestone|Type section locality|Jell (1968) defined a type section in Magpie Creek between 7859-753650 and 744662 (top).  The base of the unit is nowhere exposed, being covered by Tertiary ferricrete and basalt.  About 400 m of bioclastic calcarenite and calcirudite are exposed in this section.   The grid references are based on the AGD 66 datum.|19/MAR/08
10574|Lockup Well Limestone|Extent|A narrow belt up to 600 m wide on the northern edge of the large laterite plateau in central BURGES, and extending for 8 km southwest from Lockup Well.|
10574|Lockup Well Limestone|Thickness range|190 to 690 m.|
10574|Lockup Well Limestone|Lithology|Mainly bioclastic calcirudite and calcarenite with only sporadic thin siliciclastic interbeds.|
10574|Lockup Well Limestone|Fossils|The limestone contains a fauna dominated by corals, and stromatoporoids, but has not been studied in detail.  Conodonts have been studied by Telford (1975) and Mawson & Talent (in press).|
10574|Lockup Well Limestone|Relationships and boundaries|The unit is part of the Wando Vale Subgroup of the Broken River Group.  The base is obscured by Tertiary ferricrete and basalt.  It is overlain by a thin mudstone interval equated with the Papilio Mudstone, although this is generally too thin to map out at 1.100 000 scale and the Mytton Formation is usually shown directly overlying the limestone.  The limestone is faulted against the Shield Creek Formation for much of its length.  Under the basalt and ferricrete cover it may be continuous with the Jessey Springs Limestone, and prior to faulting may have been continuous with the Dip Creek Limestone.|
10574|Lockup Well Limestone|Age reasons|The age is Emsian to early Givetian.|

23736|Lomandra Limestone|Name source|Lomandra Creek which joins Dosey Creek at 7859-603423. The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.|
23736|Lomandra Limestone|Unit history|The unit was previously mapped as part of the Broken River Formation (now Group) (White, 1959, 1962, 1965) (parts of 'F' and 'G' lenses of White (1965)).  The name was first published and described by Withnall & others (1988), but was not formally defined.|
23736|Lomandra Limestone|Geomorphic expression|Generally forms low ridges of limestone outcrops and rubble, and locally low bluffs with karst features.|
23736|Lomandra Limestone|Type section locality|Lomandra Creek between 7859-613407 (base) and 609409 (top).  The section is 390 m thick, and is part of section SD170 of Mawson & Talent (in press).

23736|Lomandra Limestone|Description at type locality|).  The lower 140 m consists of thin to medium-bedded calcilutite and calcarenite with lesser calcirudite.  The calcilutites are mainly wackestone or mudstone, and the calcarenite and calcirudite are mainly wackestone and packstone.  The next 120 m is coarser and consists of medium to thick-bedded calcarenite and calcirudite (mainly packstone and wackestone) with minor calcilutite.  The uppermost 130 m is mainly calcarenite and calcirudite (packstone and wackestone and crinoidal grainstone), most of which contain sandy and muddy terrigenous material.  See Withnall & others (1988, figure 28 and pages 68-69) for more details|
23736|Lomandra Limestone|Thickness range|Up to 400 m.|
23736|Lomandra Limestone|Lithology|Mainly bioclastic limestone (calcarenite, calcirudite, and calcilutite) represented mainly by packstone, grainstone, and wackestone, with mudstone more dominant in the lower part of the sequence; minor calcareous siltstone, arenite, and polymictic conglomerate.|
23736|Lomandra Limestone|Fossils|The unit contains crinoids, corals, stromatoporoids, and rare brachiopods, gastropods, conodonts, algae and fish fragments.  It contains the Phillipsastrea fauna, the lowermost fauna of the Chinaman Creek Limestone (Wyatt & Jell, 1967).|
23736|Lomandra Limestone|Relationships and boundaries|The Lomandra Limestone is part of the Wando Vale Subgroup of the Broken River Group.  It conformably overlies the Bracteata Mudstone and is conformably overlain by the Storm Hill Sandstone.  Where the latter lenses out north of the type section, it is directly overlain by the Dosey Limestone.  North of the Broken River, it passes laterally into the Burges Formation, which consists mainly of mudstone, arenite, and polymictic conglomerate.|
23736|Lomandra Limestone|Age reasons|Conodonts indicate a late Emsian to early Eifelian age (Mawson & Talent, in press).|

22213|Long Gully Granite|Name source|The unit is named after Long Gully, a tributary of the Walsh River to the east of Chillagoe Creek (in CHILLAGOE).|
22213|Long Gully Granite|Unit history|Previously mapped as Elizabeth Creek Granite by Best (1962) and de Keyser & Lucas (1968), and as Bungabilly Adamellite by Richards (1981).|
22213|Long Gully Granite|Geomorphic expression|The unit forms undulating country with scattered large rounded boulders and bouldery outcrops.  It is characterised by medium to dark tones on aerial photographs.|
22213|Long Gully Granite|Type section locality|The designated type area is about 150 m west-southwest of Walsh's hut, at GR 2331 81150. The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.|
22213|Long Gully Granite|Description at type locality|The adamellite crops out as large rounded boulders in this area.|
22213|Long Gully Granite|Extent|The unit crops out over an area of ~8 km2, north and south of the Walsh River.  It occurs mainly as an irregular, elongate, northwesterly-trending pluton.|
22213|Long Gully Granite|General description|STRUCTURE AND METAMORPHISM:: The Long Gully Granite is essentially massive and unmetamorphosed.  Quartz grains commonly show slightly undulose extinction, indicating some post-crystallisation deformation.|
22213|Long Gully Granite|Lithology|The Long Gully Granite is typically a pale grey to pale pink, medium-grained hornblende-biotite adamellite.  Scattered rounded aggregates of quartz grains up to 1 cm in diameter impart a distinctive 'porphyritic' texture to the rocks.  Locally, the adamellite contains scarce interstitial grains of pyrite.  Rounded mafic enclaves up to 30 cm in diameter are common.  In several places (e.g., at GR 2331 81150, GR 2309 81182) net-veined complexes of adamellite and diorite are exposed.  The irregular, crenulate and embayed outlines of many of the diorite inclusions (up to 2 m in diameter) and the abundant net-veining by adamellite strongly suggests that magma mixing has taken place (Blake & others, 1965). This granite has a hypidiomorphic granular texture and consists mainly of quartz, plagioclase, and K-feldspar, together with minor biotite and hornblende, and accessory and secondary minerals.  Quartz forms anhedral, interstitial grains, 1 to 5 mm across, and scattered rounded aggregates of grains.  Most grains show slightly undulose extinction and some quartz aggregates are rimmed by fine biotite flakes.  Plagioclase grains range from 1 mm to 1 cm in length.  They are mainly subhedral and many show well-developed oscillatory zoning.  K-feldspar generally forms irregular, anhedral grains (0.1 to 2 mm long), most of which crystallised relatively late.  Hornblendes are pleochroic from dark green or blue-green to pale yellow.  They show two distinct habits - euhedral to subhedral laths, 1 to 2 mm long, and small (0.1 - 0.5 mm), more irregular interstitial grains.  Biotite forms scattered subhedral to euhedral flakes, up to 4 mm in length, and much smaller interstitial grains, pleochroic from dark brown to straw-yellow.  Some of the larger flakes show fairly pronounced undulose extinction. The granite contains traces of allanite, opaque oxide, zircon, apatite, and primary sphene, mainly as small (0.2 - 0.5 mm) interstitial grains.  They are generally fairly fresh, but locally show slight alteration.  Myrmekitic intergrowths are present in marginal zones of some plagioclase grains in contact with grains of K-feldspar.  Mafic inclusions ('diorite' and 'quartz diorite'; commonly extensively altered) are common and, in places (e.g., at GR 2331 81150 and GR 2309 81182) the adamellite forms a net-veined complex with 'diorite' or 'quartz diorite'.  The grid references are based on the AGD66 datum.|
22213|Long Gully Granite|Age reasons|The Long Gully Granite has not been isotopically dated, but is most probably Late Carboniferous.|
22213|Long Gully Granite|Comments|The Long Gully Granite forms part of the Doolan Creek Ring Complex of Branch (1966), and the Northern Tate Batholith of Richards (1981).  Richards included the unit in his Bungabilly Adamellite, but it is more mafic and enclave rich and contains hornblende, as well as late-stage, largely interstitial K-feldspar (orthoclase?) rather than large subhedral to anhedral grains of orthoclase microperthite.Modal analyses of three samples of Long Gully Granite plot in the adamellite field on a QKP diagram (as modified by Chappell, 1978).

10823|Lowmead Formation|Type section locality|A composite section of 591.1 m (estimated true thickness of 589.8 m), from 14 to 286.2 m in LDD7 (65665E 97292N Miriam Vale 1:100 000 Sheet area) 35.1 m to 246.5 m LDD14 (64906E 95222N Miriam Vale 1:100 000 Sheet area), 56 m to 147 m in LDD1 (67628E 93690N Miriam Vale 1:100 000 Sheet area) and 25.7 m to 47.2 m in LDD16 (69066E 94908N Miriam Vale 1:100 000 Sheet area. LDD14 is located 2.2 km SSW of LDD7. LDD1 is located 4.1 km S of LDD7. LDD16 is located 4.1 km SE of LDD7. The formation is an interbedded sequence of claystone, kerogenous claystone (oil shale, kerogen-rich carbonaceous shale and coal (carbonaceous oil shale), and minor sandstone, siltstone and sandy claystone with beds ranging from 0.05 m to 32 m thick. The formation unconformably overlies igneous rock and is unconformably overlain by unconsolidated Quaternary sediment. The Lowmead Formation has been sub-divided into six conformable members. In order of decreasing age they are the Hobble Creek, Harpur Creek, Wheatley Oil Shale, Korenan Oil Shale, Makowata Oil Shale, and Sonoma Members. Correlation between drill holes is on the basis of lithology, confirmed (where available) by comparison of assay histograms of oil yield from oil shale beds. Between drill holes LDD7 and LDD14 the correlation is based on the boundaries of the Makowata Oil Shale Member, the top of which occurs at 286.2 m in LDD7 and 35.1 m in LDD14. Between drill holes LDD4 and LDD1 the top of the Wheatley Oil Shale Member has been used, which occurs at 213.6 m in LDD14 and 25.8 m in LDD1. Correlation of LDD16 to LD1 is made using the top of the Hobble Creek Member which occurs at 147 m in LDD1 and 25.7 m in LDD16.|
10823|Lowmead Formation|Extent|Subcrops in an area of about 65 km2 between Lowmead township and Coongoola homestead within the Lowmead Graben. Outcrop is present, but weathering renders it unsuitable for stratigraphic correlation. Two relatively fresh exposures of oil shale are found in road quarries at grid references 66550E 94150N and 64000E 94600N Miriam Vale 1:100 000 Sheet area. The formation has been identified from drill core.|
10823|Lowmead Formation|Thickness range|596.1 m in the type section (estimated true thickness 589.8 m corrected for dip of strata in drill holes). This is the maximum known thickness of the formation.|
10823|Lowmead Formation|Lithology|Claystone is dusky yellow-green to olive-grey, ranging from very thick to lamina beds and is soft (puggy) to hard. It is calcareous in part. Oil shale is dark to dusky yellow-brown, hard, well laminated and calcareous in part. Carbonaceous oil shale is brownish-block, well laminataed (shaly) and hard. Sandstone beds are fine to coarse grained, massive, with sand grains poorly sorted, subangular and of low sphericity. There are interbeds of sandy claystone to clayey sandstone. Red sandy claystone (clayey sandstone and sandstone in part) occur at the base of the formation (Hobble Creek Member).|
10823|Lowmead Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The Lowmead Formation unconformably overlies Palaeozoic and Mesozoic igneous rocks of the Miriam Vale Granodiorite and the Agnes Waters Volcanics (Ellis and Whitaker, 1976). The top of the formation is eroded. It is in part unconformably overlain by Quaternary overburden. The formation is faulted against igneous rocks of the Miriam Vale Granodiorite and the Agnes Waters Volcanics and is contained within the Lowmead Graben.|
10823|Lowmead Formation|Age reasons|An Early Tertiary age is indicated using microfloral and macrofloral and faunal evidence (Ball, 1916; Beasley, 1945). Correlation with other Tertiary oil shale deposits in central Queensland (Rundle & Stuart - Hendstridge and Missen 1982, and Yaamba) and with the Redbank Plains Formation (Cranfield et al, 1976) would restrict the Lowmead Formation to the middle to Late Eocene.|
10823|Lowmead Formation|Comments|Note: Drill core of LDD1, LDD7, LDD14 and LDD16, is stored at Southern Pacific Petroleum's Research and Core Storage facility in Gladstone, Queensland.|

25185|Lunch Creek Gabbro|Name source|Lunch Creek, which flows east just to the south of the main mass of the unit, 9 km east of Mary Kathleen, latitude 20o47'24"S, longitude 140o3'45"E (6956 025007).|
25185|Lunch Creek Gabbro|Geomorphic expression|Well-grassed, high bouldery hills cut by creeks which expose many fresh rock pavements.|
25185|Lunch Creek Gabbro|Type section locality|Along an unnamed east flowing stream from 3 to 5 km west-northwest of Timberu Homestead, I.e. latitude 20o45'15"S, longitude 140o4'30"E (6956 037046) to latitude 20o45'10"S, longitude 140o3'10"E (6956 014048). Extensive rock pavements provide excellent exposure of the various gabbros, diorites and pegmatite.|
25185|Lunch Creek Gabbro|Extent|The main mass of Lunch Creek Gabbro is a 2 km wide belt that extends northward from just north of Lunch Creek 9 km east of Mary Kathleen. A smaller mass of the Gabbro has been mapped 7 to 9 km further to the east, east of the Corella River and north of the Barkly Highway.|
25185|Lunch Creek Gabbro|Thickness range|The Gabbro is about 500 m thick.|
25185|Lunch Creek Gabbro|Lithology|Mostly olivine-pyroxene gabbro, with biotite diorite, biotite gabbro, hybrid diorite, tonalite, and minor hornblende-feldspar pegmatite. Some small-scale layering from a mafic-rich base to a felsic-rich top occurs locally in the gabbros. The unit is described by Derrick et al. (1971).|
25185|Lunch Creek Gabbro|Relationships and boundaries|The Lunch Creek Gabbro intrudes the Corella Formation and is intruded by the Burstall Granite and related acid porphyry dykes, fine-grained basic dykes, and dykes of the Lakeview Dolerite.|
25185|Lunch Creek Gabbro|Age reasons|Page (1975, pers. comm.) considers that a rubidium/strontium age of 1466+/-78 m.y. is a reliable minimum estimate for the time of emplacement of the Lunch Creek Gabbro.|

27293|Lyall Formation|Name source|Parish of Lyall, County of Clarke.|
27293|Lyall Formation|Unit history|Previously part of the Clarke River Formation (now Group) (White, 1959).|
27293|Lyall Formation|Geomorphic expression|The Lyall Formation generally forms moderately hilly country. An irregular pattern of ridges is typical of the coarse sandstone and conglomerate, whereas low, continuous ridges outlining bedding trends are more characteristic of areas where finer sedimentary rocks are interbedded with the coarser rock types. Except for the Meath Rhyolite Member, vegetation on the Lyall Formation is generally less dense than on the Venetia Formation.|
27293|Lyall Formation|Type section locality|A composite type section comprising three separate sections is proposed for the Lyall Formation. The lower section is approximately 400 m thick and extends from GR961517 (top of the Venetia Formation which is recognised by its lack of volcanic detritus) to GR 949515 (base of the Meath Rhyolite Member); this includes the type section (holostratotype) of the Furry Hoop Member (approximately 320 m thick) between GR 960516 (base) and 951515 (top, see separate definition). The second section is the type section of the Meath Rhyolite Member (approximately 75 m thick) which crops out along the Clarke River from GR 948504 (base) to 946404 (top). The third section (approximately 290 m thick) is through the volcanolithic rocks overlying the Meath Rhyolite Member, along a tributary of Keppel Creek South between GR 944568 (top) of Meath Rhyolite Member and 930550 (synclinal hinge).|
27293|Lyall Formation|Extent|The Lyall Formation crops out in the central and western parts of the Clarke River Basin, about 40 km southeast of Greenvale, adjacent to and west of the range of hills which form the Venetia Formation. It is obscured by Tertiary laterite to the north, and by Cainozoic basalt to the southeast. An outlier also occurs about 10 km east of Niall homestead.|
27293|Lyall Formation|Thickness range|Probably up to 850 m, although structural complexities prevent an accurate estimate of the thickness in many places. The original thickness is unknown because of erosion of the top of the formation.|
27293|Lyall Formation|Lithology|The Lyall Formation can be informably divided into lower and upper subunits, separated by the ignimbrite of the Meath Rhyolite Member. The lower subunit consists largely of volcanolithic sandstone (sporadically pebbly) pebble to boulder conglomerate, red-green siltstone to fine-grained sandstone and tuff. The rocks of the lower subunit are typically calcareous with a large volcanic component. The upper subunit has a basal sequence of calcareous siltstone, tuffaceous sandstone and sporadic dirty limestone overlain by coarse green volcanolithic sandstone and boulder to cobble conglomerate.|
27293|Lyall Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The Lyall Formation conformably (with possible local angular unconformity) overlies the Venetia Formation, from which it is distinguished by its large acid volcanic component. The contact could be a disconformity. The Furry Hoop Member occurs in the lower part of the formation. A resistant, ridge-forming ignimbrite, the Meath Rhyolite Member, marks the middle of the formation separating the informal upper and lower subunits. The Lyall Formation is intruded to about the level of the Meath Rhyolite Member by quartz porphyry bosses and stocks. It is also intruded by the Oweenee Granite in the outlier to the southwest (on Spring Park Station). To the north the Lyall Formation is overlain by Tertiary laterite, and to the south by Cainozoic basalt.|
27293|Lyall Formation|Age reasons|The Lyall Formation is late Visean to Late Carboniferous, possibly extending into the Early Permian (a hiatus is likely within the sequence) (Jell & Playford, in press).|

10907|Ma Ma Creek Member|Name source|The name is derived from Ma Ma Creek in the Laidley Valley, southeast Queensland.|
10907|Ma Ma Creek Member|Unit history|The name of the unit was first proposed by McTaggart (1963) and published as Ma Ma Creek 'Sandstone' Member.|
10907|Ma Ma Creek Member|Geomorphic expression|Not characteristic; mostly weathers recessively, and generally obscured by alluvium.|
10907|Ma Ma Creek Member|Type section locality|Reference Section: McTaggart (1963) did not nominate a type section and Gray (1975) designated the interval 1030'3" (314.02 m) to 1368'4" (417.07 m) in GSQ Ipswich 18 as a reference section. Type Section: The type section for the Ma Ma Creek Member is nominated as the interval 971.1 m - 1073.52 m in GSQ Ipswich 24.|
10907|Ma Ma Creek Member|Description at type locality|The graphic log of GSQ Ipswich 24 (Fig. 10) shows the lithological sequence in the member. The depositional environment is considered to be lacustrine. The member is characterised by the presence of a chamositic oolite in the siltstone.|
10907|Ma Ma Creek Member|Extent|The member is recognised chiefly in the Laidley Valley area. Identification of the member elsewhere is difficult although it is possibly present in parts of the southern Clarence-Moreton Basin. It is not present at many localities, and in many well sections. Identified outcrops of the Ma Ma Creek Member are confined to the northern part of the basin and the finer grained shale and siltstone are poorly exposed and difficult to identify. Poor outcrops doubtfully referred to as the Ma Ma Creek Member are found as far south as sections on the western flank of the basin where they are cut by the Bruxner and Gwydir Highways.|
10907|Ma Ma Creek Member|Depositional environment|The most characteristic rock type is a fine grained, grey shale/siltstone sequence which in drill core commonly contains 2-10 cm beds of chamositic oolite. The depositional environment is considered to be lacustrine.|
10907|Ma Ma Creek Member|Fossils|Plant and wood fossils and spores, pollen grains and sporadic acritarchs.|
10907|Ma Ma Creek Member|Relationships and boundaries|The base is generally taken as a sharp boundary between dark grey siltstone and shale of the Ma Ma Creek Member with quartzose, lithic and feldspathic, cross-bedded sandstone, fine to coarse and very coarse grained sandstone of the underlying Gatton Sandstone. The upper boundary is less well defined because many sections of the Ma Ma Creek Member, such as those present in GSQ Ipswich 18 and 24, show a high proportion of sandstone in the upper part of the member. The upper boundary is therefore taken as the first appearance of coarse to very coarse grained sandstone, the base of which is commonly marked by a thin granule and pebble conglomerate. This boundary is interpreted as the base of the first stacked multistorey, fining up, channel sand. The underlying, upper part of the Ma Ma Creek Member is commonly cross-laminated to ripple cross laminated, uniform, fine and medium grained sandstone with interbedded mudstone intervals. This sandstone commonly forms 2-5 m cliff faces in the creeks around the Lockyer Valley.|
10907|Ma Ma Creek Member|Identifying features|See NSW for card|
10907|Ma Ma Creek Member|Age reasons|The member is late Early Jurassic in age and contains the upper limit of palynological assemblage D (de Jersey, 1971, 1976; McKellar, 1981b) which lies in the interval 1035.29 m to 1034.19 m, of GSQ Ipswich 18. It is also associated with the succeeding interval J2 (Toarcian) in JM Urbenville 1. The palynofloras are equivalent to those recovered from beds adjacent to the oolitic ironstone sequence in the upper Evergreen Formation, and the basal Hutton Sandstone of the Surat Basin.

27185|Magna Lynn Metabasalt|Name source|The Magna Lynn copper mine, 28 km north-northwest of Mary Kathleen, latitude 22o33'S, longitude 139o52'E (6856 812275).|
27185|Magna Lynn Metabasalt|Geomorphic expression|The Magna Lynn Metabasalt generally forms a broad undulating valley between two units of predominantly acid vaolcanics, and is especially useful in the identification of different acid volcanic formations in fault zones. The unit has previously been mapped as "db" on the Cloncurry and Duchess 4-mile Geological Sheets and described as "altered dolerite dykes and basalt" and "metadolerite and metabasalt" in the respective map references. In Carter et al. (1961, p.133), "db" is described as "intrusive metadolerite (mainly anastomosing dykes) in the Leichhardt Metamorphics and Argylla Formation. Outcrops are large, branched, and elongated north-south". The anastomosing pattern results from fault repetition within the Tewinga Group, and intrsion of the basalt by sills of porphyritic rhyolite comagmatic with Argylla Formation lavas. The unit is described in detail in Derrick et al. (1974), and Wilson et al. (in prep). A general description can be found in Plumb & Derrick (1975).|
27185|Magna Lynn Metabasalt|Type section locality|Along the north bank of an unnamed creek, 10 km south-southwest of the Referee copper mine, 3.2 km north of the Lillimay copper mine, latitude 20o24'25"S, longitude 139o50"E. The base of the section is 0.4 km east-southeast of a water hole which is accessible by a track from the old Mount Isa-Kajabbi road. The top of the section is at the foot of a high northwest-trending ridge 1.5 km east-southeast of the water hole. At the type locality the basal unit of the Magna Lynn Metabasalt rests conformably on a ridge of creamy grey fine-grained rhyolite of the Leichhardt Metamorphics. Dips are from 40o to 60o to the northeast. All rocks in the formation show evidence of upper greenschist facies metamorphism. The basal 200 m of the Magna Lynn Metabasalt section consists of several flows of fine-grained altered basalt with amygdaloidal and brecciated flow tops, and some minor intercalations of greenish brown thin-bedded fine-grained epidotized quartzite. A dyke of porphyritic rhyolite trends north-northeast through this part of the section, where there is also a similarly oriented fault with a sinistral displacement of about 50 m. Towards the middle of the section a sequence of up to 150 m of metamorphosed thin-bedded ferruginous calcareous sandstone, lamintead siltstone and basic tuff is intercalated with basaltic flows and fine-grained epidote-rich sandstone and siltstone containing basaltic blocks. This sequence is overlain by about 200 m of predominantly basaltic rocks in which at least 10 flows with amygdaloidal tops can be recognised; minor basalt/sediment mixes, basic tuff, and thin lenticular grey to brown fine-grained quartzite are intercalated with these flows. Near the top of the type section two fairly continuous quartzite units up to 20 m thick are separated by about 50 m of amygdaloidal basalt and minor grey porphyritic andesite. A thin amygdaloidal basalt overlies the upper quartzite and is conformably overlain by grey porphyritic dacite that marks the base of the Argylla Formation. The total thickness in the type section is about 520 m.|
27185|Magna Lynn Metabasalt|Extent|The Magna Lynn Metabasalt is exposed to the east of longitude 139o45'E in a north-trending belt, 5 km wide and 120 km long, which extends from about 12 km northwest of Duchess northwards to Kajabbi. It also occurs in a fault block between 10 and 25 km northwest of Mary Kathleen. The formation has been mapped in the Mary Kathleen and Prospector 1:100 000 Sheet areas and is known to occur in the Alsace and Duchess 1:100 000 Sheet areas. Future mapping may show that this formation extends to the north of Kajabbi and to the west and southwest of Duchess.|
27185|Magna Lynn Metabasalt|Thickness range|Thickness ranges from 200 to 700 m. Metasedimentary intercalations are mostly 5 to 25 m thick but are up to 360 m thick near the East Leichhardt Dam.|
27185|Magna Lynn Metabasalt|Lithology|Massive metabasalt; amygdaloidal metabasalt with amygdales of quartz, calcite, chlorite and/or epidote; flow-top breccia; metabasalt/metasediment mixes; calcareous, epidote-rich and feldspathic quartzites; agglomerate; and basic tuff. Biotite, chlorite and actinolite schists occur in shear zones, together with secondary vein calcite and siderite.|
27185|Magna Lynn Metabasalt|Relationships and boundaries|The Magna Lynn Metabasalt appears to conformably overlie the Leichhardt Metamorphics and it is conformably overlain by the Argylla Formation. The lower contact is abrupt: pale rhyolite of the Leichhardt Metamorphics is overlain by dark metabasalt. The upper contact is gradational, metabasalt flows and grey porphyritic lavas being intercalated in the upper 50 m. The top of the Magna Lynn Metabasalt is placed at the top of the highest metabasalt lava. The unit is intruded by porphyritic acid dykes (possibly comagmatic with lavas of Argylla Formation), dolerite dykes of at least two ages, and granite (50 km north and 30 km southwest of MaryKathleen; the former is Wonga Granite, the latter is shown as Kalkadoon Granite on the Duchess 4-mile Geological Sheet but is probably also Wonga Granite). Relations with Kalkadoon Granite are not clear but current work west of Duchess suggests Kalkadoon Granite predates the Magna Lynn Metabasalt.|
27185|Magna Lynn Metabasalt|Age reasons|Precambrian, probably Carpentarian (Middle Proterozoic). The Sybella Granite, dated in part as 1656 m.y. old, intrudes rocks younger than the Magna Lynn Metabasalt and provides a minimum age for the formation (see Plumb & Derrick, 1975).|

24369|Mairindi Creek Granite|Unit history|Previously ;mapped as Kalkadoon Granite (Carter & Opik, 1963). However, the Kalkadoon Granite is now known to be significantly older than the Argylla Formation (Page, 1978).|
24369|Mairindi Creek Granite|Type section locality|0.5 km to 4.5 km E of main Duchess-Mount Isa road, from GR 725390 to GR 753400. Here the unit consists mainly of foliated, medium to coarse-grained, patchily and sparsely porphyritic biotite granite, cut by aplite and quartz veins and numerous metadolerite dykes.|
24369|Mairindi Creek Granite|Extent|The granite crops out over about 20 sq km, 9 km northwest of Duchess.|
24369|Mairindi Creek Granite|Lithology|Medium to coarse-grained, foliated, biotite granite containing scattered phenocrysts of pink microcline, quartz and rare plagioclase, and traces of muscovite, hornblende, opaque oxide, allanite and fluorite; minor aplite (as veins). The granite is cut by thin quartz veins. The well-developed, steeply dipping to vertical, NW-trending foliation is defined mainly by the parallel alignment of biotite flakes and aggregates, and is crenulated in places.|

The interval is within the type section of the Lowmead Formation. Carbonaceous oil shale is the dominant rock type. There is minor interbedded claystone. Upper and lower boundaries of the member are identified by the contact of carbonaceous oil shale with oil shale of the Sonoma Member and Korenan Oil Shale Member, respectively.|
24370|Makowata Oil Shale Member|Extent|Subcrops in an area of about 3 km2 east of Makowata railway siding. Sparse highly weathered outcrop is known. The member has been identified from drill core.|
24370|Makowata Oil Shale Member|Thickness range|43.3 m in the type section; true thickness 42.6 m corrected for a 10o dip of the strata in LDD14. The member ranges from 18.4 m to 73.5 m thick.|
24370|Makowata Oil Shale Member|Lithology|Carbonaceous oil shale is brownish-black and hard. It is composed of alternating clay, kerogenous and carbonaceous to coaly thin laminae in beds up to 28.5 m thick. Fragments of plant leaves and stems are abundant.

24371|Malacura Sandstone|Unit history|Previously mapped as part of the 'Etheridge Formation' or of the Langdon River Formation of White (1959; 1962, 1965). The 'Etheridge Formation', now redefined as a Group containing Robertson River, Townley, Heliman, Candlow, Langdon River (and other) Formations, unconformably underlies the Malacura Sandstone.|
24371|Malacura Sandstone|Geomorphic expression|Generally very subdued topography except where hornfelsed; prominent trend lines, and pale brown to red-brown tones on airphotographs; medium cover of low scrub.|
24371|Malacura Sandstone|Type section locality|Unnamed tributary of the upper Langdon River on the eastern bank of which is located Red Bull Bore, between 7460-09352285 and 7460-08402185, and thence along a small tributary of that stream to 7460-07682140.|
24371|Malacura Sandstone|Description at type locality|The rocks exposed consist of about 1300 m of medium to fine-grained feldspar-bearing, commonly micaceous sublithic sandstone or grit.|
24371|Malacura Sandstone|Extent|Exposed along most of the valley of the Langdon River, from GR 7460-070140 north to the Gilbert River, along the eastern edge of Esmeralda and Gilbert River 1:100 000 Sheets (7460 and 7461), in the northwestern corner of North Head (7560), and along the western edge of Forest Home (7561) to GR 7561-135800, where small outliers crop out on the northern side of Gilbert River near Forest Home homestead.|
24371|Malacura Sandstone|Thickness range|About 1300 to 1450 m in the south; probably thicker in the north, but top and base obscured.|
24371|Malacura Sandstone|Lithology|Generally as in type section; sandstones more dominant in the north.|
24371|Malacura Sandstone|Relationships and boundaries|Unconformably overlies Langdon River Siltstone (phyllitic siltstone) and Candlow Formation (phyllitic siltstone and sandstone). Angular relationship can be seen in places in the south, but clearer on airphotographs than on the ground. Clasts of underlying units and of granitic rocks recognisable in some sandstones. Conformable boundary with overlying 'Yarman Formation', which consists predominantly of shale and siltstone that are maroon or red-brown in outcrop. Unconformably overlain by or faulted against Croydon Volcanics and/or unconformably overlain by Mesozoic sandstones; intruded by Esmeralda Granite.|
24371|Malacura Sandstone|Age reasons|Early upper Proterozoic. Underlying rocks have been affected by deformation and metamorphism, dated at 1570+/-30 m.y. (Black et al., in press), which do not affect the Malacura Sandstone. Both the Malacura Sandstone and the overlying 'Yarman Formation' are unconformably overlain by Croydon Volcanics, dated at 1429+/-75 m.y. (Oversby et al., 1976).|

27187|Malbon Group|Name source|Township of Malbon, latitude 21o4'30"S, longitude 140o18'E.|
27187|Malbon Group|Constituents|The Malbon Group consists of the Marraba Volcanics and the Mitakoodi Quartzite.|
27187|Malbon Group|Geomorphic expression|The metabasalt and labile sediments form valleys with low boulder- and scree-covered hills and ridges. The quartzite forms rugged ridges and plateaux.|
27187|Malbon Group|Extent|The constituent formations of the group were mapped in the Cloncurry and Duchess 4-mile Sheet areas (Carter et al., 1961). Recent mapping in the Marraba 1:100 000 Sheet area has shown that several quartzite bodies to the west and northwest of Cloncurry, that were previously mapped as Corella Formation, are correlatives of the Mitakoodi Quartzite (Derrick et al., 1971).|
27187|Malbon Group|Thickness range|The group ranges in thickness from about 3500 m in the east to about 1000 m in the northwest.|
27187|Malbon Group|Lithology|Characterised by metamorphosed basic lava flows with sedimentary intercalations that are more abundant towards the top of the group, culminating in the Mitakoodi Quartzite. The sediments are predominantly fine- to medium-grained quartzofeldspathic clastics, and minor shale and calcareous rocks.|
27187|Malbon Group|Relationships and boundaries|The Malbon Group conformably overlies the Tewinga Group, and is overlain unconformably or conformably by the Mary Kathleen Group (Derrick et al., 1971; Derrick et al., in prep.). It correlates broadly with the middle to upper parts of Haslingden Group in the western succession, and the upper parts of the Soldiers Gap Group to the east.|
27187|Malbon Group|Age reasons|Precambrian, probably Carpentarian (Middle Proterozoic). The Wimberu Granite intrudes the Malbon Group, and is dated at 1530 m.y. (Richards, 1966). From the correlation with the Haslingden Group noted above, the minimum age of the Malbon Group may be about 1650 m.y., and a maximum age about 1700 m.y. (Plumb & Derrick, 1975).|

27187|Malbon Group|Comments|Remarks: Further field work is necessary to determine whether or not the Overhang Jaspilite, currently the basal formation in the Mary Kathleen Group, is more properly the topmost unit in the Malbon Group. The Cone Creek and Wakeful Metabasalt Members of the Group are host rocks to small vein-type copper deposits, particularly where the metabasalt is intruded by dolerite dykes.|
26312|Malmesbury Microgranite|Name source|The name is derived from the Parish of Malmesbury, County of O'Connell, Clarke River, 1:250 000 Series cadastral sheet.|
26312|Malmesbury Microgranite|Unit history|Included originally by White (1959) and Wyatt & others (1970) in the Oweenee Granite. This unit was expanded (Wyatt & others, 1970) to include granites which form the Coane Range northeast of the Sybil Graben. The type area of the Oweenee  Granite was remapped in 1986 as ignimbrite and consequently the name was changed to Oweenee Rhyolite. The name Malmesbury Microgranite is given to porphyritic microgranite south of the Sybil Graben formerly mapped as Oweenee Granite.|
26312|Malmesbury Microgranite|Geomorphic expression|The Malmesbury Microgranite is clearly distinguishable on aerial photographs from the associated Oweenee Rhyolite because it forms the lower, less rugged topography.|
26312|Malmesbury Microgranite|Type section locality|A section along the Gregory Developmental Road between 8059-542602 and 8059528618 is proposed.|
26312|Malmesbury Microgranite|Extent|The Malmesbury Microgranite crops out, southwest of the Sybil Graben, from the Gregory Developmental road to the Daintree tin mine. It covers an area of approximately 280 km2.|
26312|Malmesbury Microgranite|Lithology|Pink to grey-pink, extensively chloritised, porphyritic microgranite. Phenocrysts of quartz occur locally and large potassium-feldspar phenocrysts commonly are albite-rimmed.|
26312|Malmesbury Microgranite|Relationships and boundaries|The granite is not foliated, either tectonically or by magmatic processes. Joint orientations taken from the granite have strong northeast, north-northeast and northwesterly orientations. Faulting is most apparent in the area of Gin Mill where north-northwest and northwest trending faults offset blocks of Oweenee Rhyolite within the granite. The Malmesbury Microgranite intrudes the Oweenee Rhyolite. This can be seen near Silver Spray mine where porphyritic microgranite dykes cut the ignimbrite. The relationship between granites previously known as Oweenee Granite, largely cropping out north of the Sybil Graben (Whatt & others, 1970) and the Malmesbury Microgranite has not been determined.|
26312|Malmesbury Microgranite|Age reasons|A Rb/Sr isochron of 341+/-7 m.y. was obtained by Webb (1969) from granite south of the Sybil Graben. This age fits in well with the suggestions that the Oweenee Rhyolite is co-magmatic with the Malmesbury Microgranite and is an equivalent of the Middle Carboniferous Meath Rhyolite Member of the Clarke River Basin.|

24373|Maramungee Granite|Unit history|Like all granites in the eastern part of the Duchess 1:250 000 Sheet area, it was mapped as Williams Granite by Carter & Opik (1963).|
24373|Maramungee Granite|Type section locality|In the vicinity of GR 905130, 13 km NW of Answer Downs homestead, on either side of a north-draining tributary of Maramungee Creek, Selwyn 1:100 000 Sheet area. Here there are extensive, mainly bouldery exposures of heterogeneous leucocratic granitic rocks in low hilly terrain. Intrusive contacts with metamorphic rocks of the Soldiers Cap Group are exposed 400 m to the east and west.|
24373|Maramungee Granite|Extent|Forms NNE-trending outcrop 5 km long and up to 1 km wide in NE of Selwyn 1:100 000 Sheet area, centred at GR 905130, Duchess 1:250 000 Sheet area.|
24373|Maramungee Granite|Lithology|Heterogeneous, mainly medium to fine-grained leucocratic granitic rocks - granite, granodiorite and tonalite - but also includes some pegmatite. The granitic rocks range from massive to strongly foliated, and generally contain less than 5 percent dark minerals - mostly partly altered biotite.|

11255|Marburg Subgroup|Name source|The name is derived from the town of Marburg in the Ipswich 1:250 000 Sheet area, Queensland.|
11255|Marburg Subgroup|Unit history|The unit is redefined from Marburg Formation and upgraded to the Marburg Subgroup. The name was originally used by Reid (1921) as Marburg Stage of the Wolloon Coal Measures and finally evolved to the Marburg Formatioon of McTaggart (1963).|
11255|Marburg Subgroup|Constituents|The basic two fold sub-division of the Marburg Subgroup comprises the Koukandowie Formation and the underlying Gatton Sandstone and their respective members. The names Koukandowie and Gatton were formerly applied to members, but as it has been demonstrated that they extend basinwide as mappable units, they are redefined as formations. The Marburg 'Formation', of which they were a part, is therefore upgraded to Marburg Subgroup.|
11255|Marburg Subgroup|Geomorphic expression|See description of constituent formations and members. The cleaner quartzose conglomeratic sandstone intervals form prominent benches and cliffs. The lithic and silty sandstones form rounded hills and slopes and the siltstone and mudrocks weather recessively.|
11255|Marburg Subgroup|Type section locality|Reference section: Outcrops of most units are incomplete and deeply weathered and thus a reference section was nominated by Grey (1975) in GSQ Ipswich 18 stratigraphic drill hole over the interval 203'5" (620 m) to 2874.0' (876 m).  Type Section: The type section of the Marburg Subgroup is described under the two constituent formations - the Koukandowie Formation (GSQ Ipswich 24), and the Gatton Sandstone (GSQ Ipswich 18). GSQ Ipswich 24 and Ipswich 18 were originally logged and described by officers of the Geological Survey of Queenlsand (Gray, 1975; Cranfield, 1981) and subsequently relogged by A.T. Wells and P.LLE. O'Brien of the Bureau of Mineral Resources.|
11255|Marburg Subgroup|Description at type locality|The Marburg Subgroup comprises the Koukandowie Formation and the underlying Gatton Sandstone and their respective component members, and as such are described under each of the members. The Marburg Subgroup is conformably overlain by the Walloon Coal Measures in GSQ Ipswich 18 and 24 and conformably overlies the Woogaroo Subgroup in GSQ Ipswich 18. The base of the Subgroup was not reached in GSQ Ipswich 24. The Ma Ma Creek Member of the Koukandowie Formation is differentiated in GSQ Ipswich 18 and 24 but no members of the Gatton Sandstone are apparent in either well section.|
11255|Marburg Subgroup|Extent|Throughout the Clarence Moreton Basin.|
11255|Marburg Subgroup|Lithology|The Marburg Subgroup contains labile quartzose-lithic and feldspathic sandstones whereas the underlying Ripley Road Sandstone is predominantly clean quartzose sandstone that is very resistant to weathering. The sandstones in the overlying Walloon Coal Measures are volcanolithic and very friable.|
11255|Marburg Subgroup|Relationships and boundaries|In all outcrops where the upper contact is visible (there are very few) it is conformably overlain by the Walloon Coal Measures. The lower contact is an unconformity over wide areas particularly on the western margin of the basin where the Subgroup overlaps Late Triassic sediments, and Palaeozoic basement rocks. In the southern part of the Clarence-Moreton Basin notably in the Coast Range, Glenreagh and Nymboida areas, an angular unconformity occurs at the contact with the underlying Woogaroo Subgroup. Elsewhere the Marburg and Woogaroo Subgroups are apparently conformable. McElroy (1962) used the base of the lowest fossil wood horizon as the base of his Marburg 'Formation'. The top was taken as the first pebble band below the Walloon Coal Measures or alternatively at the base of the coal bearing sequence of dark shales, claystones and friable sandstone of the Walloon Coal Measures. These boundary criteria have proved to be unsatisfactory and it is proposed that sandstone composition is the most reliable method of distinguishing the Marburg Subgroup from bounding sequences. The Marburg Subgroup contains labile quartzose-lithic and feldspathic sandstones whereas the underlying Ripley Road Sandstone is predominantly clean quartzose sandstone that is very resistant to weathering. The sandstones in the overlying Walloon Coal Measures are volcanolithic and very friable.|

11255|Marburg Subgroup|Age reasons|Palynofloral assemblages in the Marburg Subgroup indicate an Early Jurassic age (Rhaetian to possibly basal Bajocian) (Cranfield et al., 1976; McKellar, 1981). Details of the ages of each formation and member of the Subgroup are described later in this report.|

11361|Marraba Volcanics|General description|Detailed regional mapping has shown that lower boundary of the Marraba Volcanics as defined by Carter et al. (1961) requires redefinition. The previous definition placed this boundary below a pink-brown, well-bedded to massive, fine-grained quartzite but Carter et al. (1961, p.72) note that this quartzite is similar in appearance to the uppermost quartzite in the underlying Argylla Formation. In mapping the Marraba 1:100 000 Sheet area, Derrick et al. (1971) restricted the Marraba Volcanics to the sequence of mainly basic volcanics, and placed the former basal quartzite in the Argylla Formation. This results in a more readily mappable lower boundary of the Marraba Volcanics, which are now separated from a sequence of acid volcanics and intercalated fine-grained quartzites. The quartzite which formerly was in the Marraba Volcanics is about 100 m thick in the west and up to 1000 m thick in the east, and is probably time equivalent to the Mount Guide Quartzite (Derrick et al., 1976b). The remaining sequence of Marraba Volcanics was subdivided by Derrick et al. (1971) into three conformable members, namely the Cone Creek Metabasalt Member, the Mount Start Member, and the Timberoo Member. They are defined elsewhere (see relevant cards for details).|

26018|Mary Kathleen Group|Name source|Township of Mary Kathleen, latitude 20o46'40"S, longitude 139o58'45"E.|
26018|Mary Kathleen Group|Constituents|The Mary Kathleen Group consists of the Ballara Quartzite, Overhang Jaspilite, Chumvale Breccia, Corella Formation, Mount Philp Agglomerate, Marimo Slate, Answer Slate, Staveley Formation and Kuridala Formation.|
26018|Mary Kathleen Group|Extent|The constituents of the group were mapped on the Dobbyn, Cloncurry and Duchess 4-mile Geological Sheets (Carter et al., 1961) and on the Boulia 1:250 000 Sheet area (Casey, 1968).|
26018|Mary Kathleen Group|Thickness range|The group ranges in thickness from about 1700 m on the eastern edge of the Kalkadoon-Leichhardt basement, where it consists of only the Ballara Quartzite and the Corella Formation, to about 4000 m in a section north of Duck Creek Anticline where it consists of Overhang Jaspilite and Corella Formation. Greater thicknesses may occur in some sections which include the slate formations further south.|
26018|Mary Kathleen Group|Lithology|Characterised by metamorphosed fine-grained sediments, shale, siltstone, marl, banded iron formation and limestone with minor fine to medium sandstone and basic tuff and basalt.|
26018|Mary Kathleen Group|Relationships and boundaries|The Mary Kathleen Group conformably or disconformably overlies the Malbon Group and unconformably overlies the Tewinga Group and the Soldiers Cap Group. It is unconformably overlain by the Mount Albert Group and Quamby Conglomerate. It is intruded by dolerite of at least three ages, the Lunch Creek Gabbro, the Tommy Creek Microgranite, the Burstall Granite, the Hardway Granite, and phases of the Naraku Granite and Wonga Granite.|
26018|Mary Kathleen Group|Age reasons|Probably between about 1780 and 1550 m.y; the age of the Argylla Formation, about 1780 m.y. minimum (McDougall et al., 1965) provides a maximum age for the unconformably overlying Mary Kathleen Group. An age of about 1650 m.y. on Sybella Granite (Plumb and Derrick, 1975), which is thought to unconformably underlie Mary Kathleen Group equivalents, may also set an older limit to the age of the Group. Granites intrusive into the Mary Kathleen Group include the Wonga Granite, dated at 1665+/-16 and 1738+/-20 m.y. (Page and Derrick, 1973); Page, pers. comm.), the Burstall Granite, dated at 1630+/-50 m.y. and 1448+/-46 m.y. (R W Page, pers. comm.), and the Wimberu Granite 1540 m.y. (Richards, 1966). The Group is also intruded by the Lunch Creek Gabbro, whose minimum age is 1498+/-78 m.y. (Page, pers. comm.). Ar40/Ar39 dating suggests that the Corella Formation was being metamorphosed between about 1570 m.y. and 1450 m.y. (Green, 1975).|

11533|McCord Granite|Name source|The unit is named after McCord Creek which drains the northwestern part of the unit.|
11533|McCord Granite|Unit history|Previously mapped as Elizabeth Creek Granite (Best, 1962;  de Keyser & Wolff, 1964;  de Keyser & Lucas, 1968).|
11533|McCord Granite|Geomorphic expression|The granite forms rough hilly country with numerous bouldery outcrops and scattered pavements.  The country underlain by the unit has an open drainage pattern and is characterised by medium tones on aerial photographs.|
11533|McCord Granite|Type section locality|The designated type locality is at GR 2268 80734, ~4 km southwest of Crystal Brook homestead, on the northern side of the track to the Tate Tin Field and the site of the abandoned settlement of Fischerton. The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.|07/MAY/08
11533|McCord Granite|Description at type locality|The granite (sensu lato) forms prominent bouldery outcrops and pavements in this area.|
11533|McCord Granite|Extent|The unit forms an irregular body with a northwesterly elongation north and south of the Tate River, ~30 km southwest of Chillagoe.  The unit extends over an area of ~220 km2|
11533|McCord Granite|General description|STRUCTURE AND METAMORPHISM:: The unit forms massive, non-foliated outcrops.MINERALISATION:: Extensive tin mineralisation in the Tate River area is intimately associated with the McCord Granite, in particular the late-stage microgranites.  The elevated Sn and Nb, as well as F, Rb, U, Th, Zr, Ga and Li abundances which characterise the McCord Granite (especially the late-stage microgranites) resulted mainly from extensive crystal fractionation (Champion, 1991).|
11533|McCord Granite|Lithology|The McCord Granite consists mainly of pale pink to cream, medium-grained, even-grained to slightly porphyritic adamellite.  K-feldspar grains are pink, euhedral to subhedral and commonly perthitic.  Albite rims are common.  Plagioclase ranges in composition from oligoclase to albite.  Most grains are only slightly to moderately zoned.  Biotite occurs as well-formed to ragged grains, pleochroic from pale yellow to dark greenish brown or red-brown and appears to have crystallised relatively late.  Fluorite is a conspicuous accessory mineral in many samples.  Miarolitic cavities and irregular pegmatitic zones are relatively common.  The pegmatitic zones consist mainly of quartz and pink K-feldspar; minor tourmaline and fluorite are commonly also present.  Quartz, tourmaline, and fluorite infill or partly infill many of the miarolitic cavities.The adamellite is intruded by pods and dykes of more highly fractionated, late-stage microgranite.  The microgranites are similar mineralogically to the early, main granite, but are of finer grainsize and are generally more strongly porphyritic.  Plagioclase is relatively sodic and typically unzoned or only slightly zoned.  Biotite flakes are mainly interstitial.The McCord Granite shows widespread alteration of plagioclase, K-feldspar, and biotite and extensive growth of secondary minerals such as chlorite, secondary biotite, muscovite, albite and fluorite (see Witt, 1987, 1988;  Pollard, 1988; and Taylor & Pollard, 1988 for more details).  The unit is extensively jointed, and the most intense alteration is commonly shown by adamellite adjacent to the joints.|
11533|McCord Granite|Relationships and boundaries|The McCord Granite intrudes the McDevitt and Dargalong Metamorphics (Proterozoic), biotite adamellite of Proterozoic or Early Silurian age (mapped as part of the Forsayth Granite by Best, 1962) and the Blackman Gap Complex of Proterozoic and Early Silurian age.  It is cut by intrusive rhyolite and fine to medium-grained granodiorite(?), quartz monzodiorite and adamellite forming the Crystalbrook Volcanic Neck of Best (1962), and by numerous quartz veins and linear greisen zones;  the latter appear to be localised along joints.  It is also inferred to be intruded by units Cgd6 and Cg3 (Cranfield, 1992) of the Ootann Supersuite of Champion (1991).|
11533|McCord Granite|Age reasons|The McCord Granite has yielded isotopic ages of 309 Ma (K-Ar; Richards & others, 1966) and 321 Ma (Rb-Sr biotite, with an assumed initial ratio of 0.710; Black, 1978).  The unit is therefore regarded as Late Carboniferous.|
11533|McCord Granite|Comments|The McCord Granite is similar to the Elizabeth Creek Granite in the Elizabeth Creek area north of Mount Surprise.  Both are members of the O'Briens Creek Supersuite of Champion (1991).  They are distinguished by their anomalously high Th, F, and, to a lesser extent, U, Ga, Y and K contents compared with granites of the Almaden and Ootann Supersuites in the region (Champion & Chappell, 1992).  The McCord also forms a prominent anomaly on airborne radiometric maps of the region.|

11575|McNamara Group|Name source|Jack McNamara's Mine on the Mount Oxide 1:100 000 Sheet at 000567, and from McNamaras Highway, a major access road.|
11575|McNamara Group|Unit history|The sequences now included in the McNamara Group have previously been mapped as part of the now discarded Mammoth Formation (Cavaney, 1975a) and as Gunpowder Creek Formation, Paradise Creek Formation, Ploughed Mountain Beds, Mingera Beds and Philpah Sandstone (Carter & others, 1961). The name was first published by Cavaney (1975b).|
11575|McNamara Group|Constituents|Lawn Hill Formation (top); Termite Range Formation; Riversleigh Siltstone; Shade Bore Quartzite; Lady Loretta Formation; Esperanza Formation; Paradise Creek Formation; Gunpowder Creek Formation; Torpedo Creek Quartzite (base).|
11575|McNamara Group|Extent|The group crops outextensively from the Nicholson River in the northern part of the Lawn Hill 1:250 000 Sheet area to the Templeton River in the south of the Mount Isa 1:250 000 Sheet area. It is bounded to the east by the Mount Gordon fault zone and is overlain to the west by Cambrian rocks of the Georgina Basin and in the Carrara and Mitcheibo 1:100 000 Sheet areas in the Northern Territory.|
11575|McNamara Group|Thickness range|The greatest thickness of McNamara Group preserved in any one section is 8500 m in the Lawn Hill 1:100 000 Sheet area. This is the only section where a complete sequence is preserved.|
11575|McNamara Group|Lithology|Three broad subdivisions can be recognised in the group: 1. A lower, mainly clastic subdivision which contains coarse sandstone and conglomerate (Torpedo Creek Quartzite), overlain by a thicker sequence of siltstone, sandstone, shale and dolomite (Gunpowder Creek Formation).  2. A middle dolomitic subdivision comprising lower and upper components of dolomite, stromatolitic dolomite, siltstone and sandstone (Paradise Creek Formation and Lady Loretta Formation) separated by massive stromatolitic chert, sandstone and siltstone (Esperanza Formation).  3. An upper clastic subdivision comprising basal orthoquartzite (Shade Bore Quartzite) overlain by siltstone, sandstone and dolomite (Riversleigh Siltstone), massive greywacke, siltstone and sandstone (Termite Range Formation) and tuff, siltstone, sandstone and shale (Lawn Hill Formation) at the top.|
11575|McNamara Group|Relationships and boundaries|The McNamara Group rests with slight angular unconformity on the Surprise Creek Formation. In the Lawn Hill Sheet area, the group lies unconformably on a basement of Kamarga Volcanics and Yeldham Granite while in the Kennedy Gap and Mammoth Mines Sheet areas, it overlies Surprise Creek Formation, Carters Bore Rhyolite, Myally Subgroup, Eastern Creek Volcanics, Judenan Beds and Leander Quartzite. The McNamara Group is overlain with angular unconformity by sandstone of the Carpentarian South Nicholson Group and by Cambrian limestones of the Georgina Basin.|
11575|McNamara Group|Identifying features|The definition of the McNamara Group, as published by Hutton, Cavaney & Sweet (1981), is hereby varied to include two new units which have been recognised in the Carrara Range Region, Northern Territory. Names of new constituent formations: Musselbrook Formation and Plain Creek Formation.  Reasons for including the new formations in the McNamara Group: In its type area, in the Lawn Hill 1:100 0000 Sheet area, th McNamara Group consists of nine formations totalling some 8500 m. Hutton and others (1981) descriabe three broad lithological subdivisions within the group: a lower, mainly clastic sequence, a middle carbonate-rich sequence, and an upper clastic sequence. During recent mapping in the Carrara Range Region in the eastern Northern Territory the Carrara Range Formation and Bluff Range beds of Smith & Roberts (1963) were subdivided into six formations. The three upper formations are a conformable sequence from Musselbrook Formation (oldest), through Plain Creek Formation, to Lawn Hill Formation (youngest). This sequence is included in the McNamara Group for the following reasons: (1) The Lawn Hill Formation, a constituent formation of the Group in its type area, has been recognised in the Carrara Range Region; and (2) the same broad threefold subdivision, described by Hutton & others (1981), is recognisable. Although the threefold subdivision is recognisable individual formations are not. The Musselbrook Formation includes the two lower subdivisions, but has not been subdivided for reasons given elsewhere (see definition of Musselbrook Formation). The Plain Creek and Lawn Hill Formations together represent the upper clastic subdivision in the Carrara Range Region.|
11575|McNamara Group|Age reasons|Mid Proterozoic (Carpentarian). It unconformably overlies the Carters Bore Rhyolite which has been dated at 1678 m.y. (Page, 1978). The upper age limit is 1270-1390 m.y. (McDougall & others, 1965) for the Roper Group, a correlative of the South Nicholson Group which unconformably overlies the McNamara Group. Tuff beds in the MOunt Isa Group which are correlatead with those in the McNamara Group have been dated by U-Pb (Zircon) as about 1670 m.y. (Page, in press).|

24376|Meath Rhyolite Member|Name source|Parish of Meath, County of Clarke.|
24376|Meath Rhyolite Member|Unit history|Previously part of the Clarke River Formation (now Group) (White, 1959).|
24376|Meath Rhyolite Member|Geomorphic expression|The Meath Rhyolite Member forms relatively narrow, continuous ridges, which are heavily wooded and have dark tones on the aerial photographs.|
24376|Meath Rhyolite Member|Type section locality|The holostratotype of the Meath Rhyolite Member (approximately 75 m thick) is along the Clarke River from GR 948504 (base) to 946505 (top), where heavily jointed, pink-buff, massive ignimbrite containing phenocrysts of quartz and biotite, crop out.|
24376|Meath Rhyolite Member|Extent|The Meath Rhyolite Member is a useful marker in the middle of the Lyall Formation. It crops out around a domal structure in the centre of the Clarke River Basin, north of the junction of the Clarke River and Keppell Creek South, and also in windows within the Tertiary laterite further to the north. It also has been mapped in the west of the basin near the Broken River.|
24376|Meath Rhyolite Member|Thickness range|In the type section the member is approximately 75 m thick, but it thins around the northern margin of the dome.|
24376|Meath Rhyolite Member|Lithology|Around the dome the Meath Rhyolite Member mainly consists of several sheets of brown-pink-orange ignimbrite which contains pumice fragments and roughly aligned fiamme. Euhedral biotite and embayed beta-quartz phenocrysts are characteristic. Minor volcanolithic sandstone and conglomerate (locally containing plant remains) are interbedded with the ignimbrite. Also, Mouthier & Rippert (1980) have described a massive, vitric, crystal ashfall-tuff, from windows in the Tertiary laterite, in the northern portion of the Clarke River Basin.|
24376|Meath Rhyolite Member|Relationships and boundaries|The Meath Rhyolite Member forms a distinctive marker unit in the Lyall Formation, dividing the formation into two informal subunits. Microfossil evidence suggests a possible hiatus at or near the onset of the volcanism (Jell & Playford, in press). Quartz porphyry bosses and stocks intrude the Clarke River Group to the level of the Meath Rhyolite Member, and may represent feeders.|
24376|Meath Rhyolite Member|Age reasons|A hiatus between the Late Visean and Late Carboniferous is suggested from palynological evidence at or near the onset of volcanism represented by the Meath Rhyolite Member (Jell & Playford, in press). Late Visean spores were described by Playford (1983) stratigraphically above what is interpreted as an equivalent of the Meath Rhyolite Member in the southwestern corner of the basin. This suggests that the member is Late Visean in age.|

26026|Melon Creek Tonalite|Unit history|The Melon Creek Tonalite  was not recognised by previous mapping (Wyatt & others, 1970).|
26026|Melon Creek Tonalite|Type section locality|The best known outcrops are around 8159-190629 in Melon Creek which is therefore designated as the type locality. Grey, medium-grained, equigranular biotite tonalite crops out at this locality. The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.|09/APR/08
26026|Melon Creek Tonalite|Extent|The Melon Creek Tonalite occurs to the east and northeast of Star homestead along Yarraman and Melon Creeks downstream to their junction with the Little Star River. It has an area of about 16 squared km.  It crops out very poorly and forms undulating sandy downs, generally more subdued and less dissected than the topography on the Argentine Metamorphics.  Outcrop is mostly restricted to very weathered material in gullies, but some fresher outcrops occur in the larger creeks, and rare boulders have been observed on the interfluves.|09/APR/08
26026|Melon Creek Tonalite|Lithology|The Melon Creek Tonalite consists of grey, medium-grained, equigranular to seriate, biotite tonalite. The tonalite is weakly foliated, but insufficient outcrops were studied to determine a predominant trend; the foliation is defined by aligned quartz and biotite, and a mortar texture around aligned plagioclase laths is locally developed. No xenoliths were observed.  In thin section the tonalite contains aggregates up to 5 mm across of slightly strained quartz (20-25%); the subgrains are subequant with straight to curved interlocking margins. Plagioclase (60%) is Na-andesine, and forms subhedral laths, generally 1-2 mm long, but some up to 5 mm; they are generally unzoned, but some grains show weak oscillatory zoning; the twin lamellae are locally weakly deformed. K-feldspar is rare and interstitial. Biotite (10-20%) forms clumps of yellow-brown flakes up to 2 mm across, commonly containing pleochroic haloes and apatite inclusions; partial alteration to epidote and minor chlorite is present.|07/MAR/08
26026|Melon Creek Tonalite|Relationships and boundaries|The Melon Creek Tonalite intrudes the Argentine Metamorphics (subunits PLa[subscript]m and PLa[subscript]sa). It is overlain to the west by the Late Devonian to Carboniferous Keelbottom Group (formerly Star beds). To the north, it is overlain by the Carboniferous Tareela Volcanics; the contact is obscured by alluvium along the Little Star River, but is probably faulted.|07/MAR/08
26026|Melon Creek Tonalite|Age reasons|No isotopic data are available on the tonalite and its age is therefore uncertain. However, it is likely to be in the range Ordovician to Early Devonian like most of the components of the Ravenswood and Lolworth Batholiths in the southern part of the province (Hutton & others, 1990b).|07/MAR/08
37120|Melrose Igneous Complex|Name source|The unit is named after Melrose homestead, which is situated about 2km to the west of the complex.|30/NOV/09
37120|Melrose Igneous Complex|Unit history|The Melrose Igneous Complex comprises intermingled felsic to mafic coarse-grained intrusives and metamophics that was previously included within the Boondooma Igneous Complex by Murphy & others (1976).|30/NOV/09
37120|Melrose Igneous Complex|Geomorphic expression|The unit forms sparsely wooded low ridges and undulating hills ranging from 340m to 380m in elevation.|30/NOV/09
37120|Melrose Igneous Complex|Type section locality|The type area is designated as between AMG 366000 7091300 and 367200 7092000 near the intersection of Galbraith Creek and the Stuart River.  The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.|30/NOV/09
37120|Melrose Igneous Complex|Extent|The Melrose Igneous Complex forms a narrow belt extending south-east for about 8km from a position around 2km east of Melrose homestead, 14km south-south-east of Proston. The unit flanks the northeastern margin of the Stuart River Granite, covering an area of approximately 4km2.|30/NOV/09
37120|Melrose Igneous Complex|Lithology|The unit contains a variety of mostly mafic rock types, along with scattered granite phases and meta-sedimentary rafts.  The most typical mafic rock type is fine to medium grained, dark grey hornblende diorite which ranges in texture from equigranular to coarsely porphyritic (or megacrystic) in feldspar.  This rock type locally grades into microgranodiorite or more rarely dolerite.  The granitic component of the unit is lithologically similar to the Hivesville Granite, ranging from equigranular to coarsely megacrystic, in a quenched-fined grained matrix.  The metasedimentary rafts are mainly laminated siliceous or biotite gneiss, probably representing fragments of the nearby Fifer Creek Metamorphics.Near the Galbraith Creek-Stuart River confluence the unit is cut by north-west-trending steeply dipping mylonitic shear zones with a sinistral sense of shear.|30/NOV/09
37120|Melrose Igneous Complex|Relationships and boundaries|The complex intrudes the Fifer Creek Metamorphics and is .is intruded by Triassic diorite (Rgd), granodiorite (Rg3), and granite (Rg2) bodies, and probably also by the Permo-Triassic Stuart River Granite. The unit has an uncertain relationship with the Hivesville Granite and may be close to the same age.  The common occurrence of feldspar megacrysts (or porphyroblasts) in both units and the range of mafic to felsic compositions in the Melrose Igneous Complex suggest that the latter results from the admixture of mafic magmas with Hivesville Granite magmas along the western margin of the granite pluton.|30/NOV/09
37120|Melrose Igneous Complex|Age reasons|No radiometric dating of the unit has been undertaken, but parts of the unit have lithological similarities to the adjacent Hivesville Granite.  Consequently the Melrose Igneous Complex is thought to range from Permian to Triassic in age.|30/NOV/09

24378|Meringa Basalt|Name source|Meringa railway station (GR 696115, Bartle Frere 1:100 000 Sheet area, 8063), 18 km south of Cairns, Queensland.|
24378|Meringa Basalt|Unit history|Previously included in the Atherton Basalt by Best (1960) and de Keyser (1964).|
24378|Meringa Basalt|Type section locality|Basalts of this unit crop out poorly and are highly to extremely weathered. Less weathered olivine basalt appears to be restricted to the southern flanks of the Green Hill cone (GR 733150, Bartle Frere 1:100 000 Sheet area) which is designated the type locality.|
24378|Meringa Basalt|Extent|Green Hill volcanic cone (GR 731154, Bartle Frere 1:100 000 Sheet area, 8063) and its flanks, and in small deeply weathered inlier (GR 689119, Bartle Frere 1:100 000 Sheet area, 8063) near Meringa, which is possibly continuous to Green Hill. The total area of surface exposure is about 7 km2; the subsurface extent about 26 km2.|
24378|Meringa Basalt|Lithology|The olivine basalt is fine-grained and porphyritic with small phenocrysts (2 mm) of olivine and subordinate augite; basaltic fragments or ejecta are distinguished by their finer texture and less altered olivine microphenocrysts. The steep sided Green Hill cone is composed of basaltic scoria. Flow structures are occasionally seen. Elsewhere, rocks of the unit are deeply weathered and have developed dark red to red-brown soils. In the Meringa area, the only surface evidence of the basalt is the presence of these dark soils and the slightly higher relief above the surrounding alluvial plain.|
24378|Meringa Basalt|Relationships and boundaries|The Meringa Basalt is considered to represent one of the most recent phases of volcanic activity in the Atherton Volcanic Province. The Green Hill vent is the most obvious source for the basalt, but a second subsidiary vent is suggested by drillhole sections (Muller, 1978) near Meringa. Pleistocene alluvial deposits on basement rocks comprising metasediments of the Hodgkinson Formation and the Bellenden Ker Granite are unconformably overlain by the Meringa Basalt. Local erosion preceded subsequent sediment deposition by the Mulgrave River; the overlying sediments have a maximum thickness of 35 m (Muller, 1978).|
24378|Meringa Basalt|Age reasons|A whole rock isotopic date on basalt (DA 1) from Green Hill resulted in a date of 0.986 x 106 m.y. (Pleistocene; Muller & Henry, 1982).|

25245|Mitakoodi Quartzite|General description|In the Marraba 1:100 000 Sheet area, Derrick et al. (1971) delineated three units within the Mitakoodi Quartzite as defined by Carter et al. (1961). The basal unit is a thick sequence of feldspathic quartzite, and the top unit consists of fine sandstone, siltstone and slate. At and near the top of the basal unit, several minor sequences of basic lava are present; the topmost and most prominent of these is defined as the Wakeful Metabasalt Member of the Mitakoodi Quartzite. The other sequences are not formally named.  The relation between the Mitakoodi Quartzite and younger formations also needs revision as a result of the detailed mapping. Carter et al. (1961) state that the Mitakoodi Quartzite is overlain conformably by the Marimo Slate (p.77) and the Answer Slate (p.82) in the east, and is overlain apparently conformably, by the Corella Formation (p.77) in the north. The Mitakoodi Quartzite was considered to be overlain, apparently conformably, by the Overhang Jaspilite (Derrick et al., 1971) which has been mapped as part of the Mary Kathleen Group in the Marraba and Mary Kathleen Shet areas, and is known to extend into adjoining Sheet areas to the south. The upper contact of the Overhang Jaspilite is currently being studied in more detail.|

24385|Monte Christo Member|Unit history|Part of The Narrows Beds (Kirkegaard et al, 1970) and part of the Rundle Formation (Henstridge and Missen, 1982).|
24385|Monte Christo Member|Type section locality|224 m of claystone and oil shale with minor sandstone, impure dolomite and coaly bands; from 323.8 to 548 m in drill hole GSQ Rockhampton 2 (Noon, 1981), which is part of the type section of the  Rundle Formation. GSQ Rockhampton 2 is locatead at GR 313,210E, 7,363,665N, Gladstone 1:100 000 topographic sheet. The Monte Christo Member contains two major oil shale sections (from 382 to 454 m and from 488 to 538 m in type section) where the oil shale is interbedded with claystone. The basal part of the member contains minor siltstone and sandstone beds.|
24385|Monte Christo Member|Extent|Subcrops in an area of about 110 km2 in The Narrows Graben, N.W. of Gladstone, Queensland. Sparse, weathered outcrops are recorded. The member has been identified from drill hole core.|
24385|Monte Christo Member|Thickness range|224.2 m (estimated true thickness 220.1 m corrected for an apparent dip of 11o in GSQ Rockhampton 2 in type section   ?????  2 is the only drill hole to have intersected the Monte Christo Member.       |
24385|Monte Christo Member|Lithology|Oil shale and claystone; the oil shale is dark to moderate yellowish-brown with olive gradations. Claystone beds are light olive-grey to greenish-grey and in places can be silty or sandy. Part of the member is very calcareous and in places there are discontinuous impure dolomite beds (up to 1.1 m thick) and very thin coaly bands. Cyclicity of rock types within the member is common; breccias and peloids are abundant. In places the member is richly fossiliferous; with mainly ostracode tests, occasional gastropods, fish elements and other rare vertebrate macrofossils. Claystone and brecciated clayey oil shale beds arae often bioturbated, showing well-preserved burrows in places. Desiccation features are common with current bedding being recorded in sandy units. To the east within The Narrows Graben, sandy beds within the member increase in number and thickness and there are interbeds of red haematitic claystone.|
24385|Monte Christo Member|Relationships and boundaries|The member is conformable with the underlying Worthington formation and is the contact between oil shale and claystone. The upper contact is the conformable contact between claystone and oil shale of the Teningie Creek Member.

12136|Montgomery Range Igneous Complex|Name source|Montgomery Range, which is part of the Great Dividing Range southwest of 'Pandanus Creek'.|
12136|Montgomery Range Igneous Complex|Unit history|Branch (1966) and White (1959, 1962, 1965) mapped the rocks as the Montgomery Range Rhyolite Porphyry.  Because of the wide range of rock types, the name was changed to Montgomery Range Igneous Complex by Withnall & others (1988).  It was decided not to give separate names to the plutons, because of a shortage of available names in the area, and the lack of detailed studies.  It would be possible to separately name some of the larger plutons with more detailed work.|
12136|Montgomery Range Igneous Complex|Geomorphic expression|The rocks generally form rugged, boulder-strewn hills with up to 150 m of relief.|
12136|Montgomery Range Igneous Complex|Type section locality|White (1959) gave the type area as Montgomery Range, which is the northeastern half of the belt. This includes most of the range of the rock types, as well as the Bundock Creek Group, which is intruded by them.|
12136|Montgomery Range Igneous Complex|Extent|Numerous intrusions from 'Pandanus Creek' southwest to 'Blackbraes' in a belt 50 km long and 20 km wide.|
12136|Montgomery Range Igneous Complex|Lithology|Fine to medium-grained, equigranular to porphyritic, biotite granite, biotite-hornblende granite and granodiorite, microgranite, and granophyre.  These form stocks up to 40 km2 in area.  Numerous sills of rhyolite and some microgranite up to 100 m thick, and dykes of rhyolite and less common dacite, are also included in the Complex.|
12136|Montgomery Range Igneous Complex|Age reasons|The sills are probably of Early Carboniferous age, because they intrude the Teddy Mount Formation, and were folded by the main mid(?) Carboniferous folding event.  The later plutons are probably Late Carboniferous or Permian.|

23805|Mooramin Granite|Description at type locality|At type location, grey, fine to medium-grained foliated and locally sheared biotite-muscovite granite contains numerous biotite schist and quartz xenoliths.|
23805|Mooramin Granite|Lithology|Grey to brown-grey, fine to medium-grained foliated and locally mylonitised cordierite-bearing muscovite-biotite granite. The granite hosts numerous biotite-rich schlieren and metasedimentary xenoliths of dominantly biotite schist and quartzite as well as quartz. The northwestern quarter of the unit, as mapped, is highly sheared and has been converted to mica schist. It also includes migmatitic phases.|
23805|Mooramin Granite|Relationships and boundaries|The Mooramin Granite forms the core of the uplifted Fletchers Awl Dome. Shallow marine sediments and predominantly subaerial, intermediate lavas and volcaniclastic rocks of the Greybank Volcanics unconformably overlie the Mooramin Granite on all sides. One large (0.75 km2) and two smaller (<0.1 km2) serpentinised ultramafic bodies are hosted by the granite.  At one locality, a dyke of granite appears to intrude the serpentinite, and therefore the ultramafic bodies are thought to represent roof pendants/rafts of country rock. However, the possibility of them being later and emplaced along a structural weakness has not been entirely excluded.|06/MAR/08
23805|Mooramin Granite|Age reasons|The age is uncertain. Fossils in the basal sedimentary sequence of the overlying Greybank Volcanics are Late Devonian. Being an S-type granite, it could have been sourced from the Anakie Metamorphic Group during the Middle to Late Cambrian deformation and metamorphism.|
24386|Moorooloo Mudstone Member|Name source|The name is derived from Moorooloo Station, located 18 km east of Springsure, Springsure 1:250 000 Sheet area.|
24386|Moorooloo Mudstone Member|Unit history|The Moorooloo Mudstone Member was formally referred to as the Middle Mudstone Member of the Cattle Creek Formation by Power (1966). Mollan & others (1969) included the unit in the Stanleigh Formation of Phillips (1960).|
24386|Moorooloo Mudstone Member|Type section locality|The type section (holostratotype) of the Moorooloo Mudstone Member is taken as the fully cored interval between 296 m and 394 m in stratigraphic bore GSQ Springsure 16, located at 24o02'36"S, 148o13'30"E. The lowermost 35 m of the type section consist of dark grey mudstone. It is laminated and even-grained near the base and slightly siltier higher up, with rare thin siltstone beds near the top. About 40 m above the bottom of the unit rounded masses of brown calcareous mudstone, some with crystalline calcite cores, are common. Higher in the section mudstone becomes gradually more silty and lighter coloured, and the proportion of siltstone increases. The coarser material is commonly calcareous. In the top half of the unit siltstone is the dominant lithology, withy mid to dark grey silty mudstone less common. The siltstone and silty mudstone are both pyritic. The sediments are bioturbated in part, and well-preserved burrows are common. Near the top, siltstone grades in places to light grey sandstone, which is fine to medium grained, fairly to poorly sorted, sublabile to labile, and has an argillaceous matrix.  Reference section: The composite cored section obtained by overlap in stratigraphic bores GSQ Springsure 7 (located at 24o16'S; 148o14'E) from 213 m to 457 m (total depth) and GSQ Springsure 8 (located at 24o16'S; 148o13'E) from 144 m to 150 m (Gray, 1976) is nominatead as a reference section (hypostratotype) for the Moorooloo Mudstone Member. This section is considerably thicker than the type section. The lowermost 193 m of the reference section comprises dark grey to black shale and siltstone (partly sandy), and minor mudstone. Limestone fragments, calcareous fossil remains, and scattered quartz pebbles occur throughout. Beds of brown-grey, iron-rich siltstone, and beds rich in pyrite occur in the lowermost 110 m. The uppermost 57 m of the unit comprise approximately equal amounts of fine, labile to sublabile sandstone and laminated, mid to dark grey shale and siltstone. Carbonaceous plant remains occur throughout.|
24386|Moorooloo Mudstone Member|Extent|Surface: The unit crops out very poorly. Weathered discontinuous outcrop occurs in Springsure Creek on Mostyndale. In Little Oaky Creek, on Moorooloo station, it is represented by a section of no outcrop stratigraphically below the outcropping Staircase  Sandstone Member.  Sub-surface: The Moorooloo Mudstone Member was intersected in stratigaraphic bores GSQ Springsure 7 and 8, drilled on Orion Creek about 20 km southeast of Springsure (Gray, 1976) and in GSQ Springsure 16 drilled 16 km northeaast of Springsure (Balfe, 1982). The unit was intersected in the petroleum exploration wells HOM Fernless 1, AFO Arcturus 1, and AFO Inderi 1. In AOE 1 (Reids Dome) and AOE 2 (Reids Dome), sandstone occurs in a position stratigraphically similar to the Riverstone Sandstone Member, but the continuity of these sandstone intervals has not been demonstrated and their equivalence is not proven. The Moorooloo Mudstone Member is therefore only tentatively identified in Reids Dome. South of Reids Dome, east of the Arcturus Anticline, and in the Consuelo Anticline, the Moorooloo Mudstone Member cannot be differentiated from the underlying Mostyndale Mudstone Member, since the Riverstone Sandstone Member is absent.|
24386|Moorooloo Mudstone Member|Thickness range|Thickness of the Moorooloo Mudstone Member ranges from a maximum of 250 m in GSQ Springsure 7 and 8, to a minimum of 46 in HOM Fernless 1. The type section is 98 m thick. The unit is 99 m thick in AFO Arcturus 1 and 104 m thick in AFO Inderi 1.|
24386|Moorooloo Mudstone Member|Lithology|The Moorooloo Mudstone Member consists mainly of dark grey mudstone which grades upward into siltstone and fine grained sandstone. At outcrop, the mid to dark grey mudstone contains large silty, calcareous concretions, and some beds of brown, fine-grained sandstone occur.|
24386|Moorooloo Mudstone Member|Fossils|Marine fossils occur throughout the unit, but in the type section are most common towards the base. The fauna is dominated by brachiopods, with some bivalves, bryozoans, large foraminifera, and crinoid fragments. In GSQ Springsure 7, large foraminifera are common towards the top of the unit. As in the Mostyndale Mudstone Member, the range of these unusual fossils is apparently restricted to the siltier parts of the unit. The observed fauna is consistent with an Early Permian age.|
24386|Moorooloo Mudstone Member|Relationships and boundaries|The Moorooloo Mudstone Member conformably overlies the Riverstone Sandstone Member, and is conformably overlain by the Staircase Sandstone Member of the Cattle Creek formation. The lower boundary of the type section is taken at the base of the monotonous dark grey mudstone, which directly overlies a 3 m thick, sandy, bioturbated transitional bed. The upper boundary is placed immediately below the first thick sandstone bed above the predominantly silty section.|
24386|Moorooloo Mudstone Member|Identifying features|Wireline logs: The gamma-ray log shows many high frequency, low amplitude variations, and a response which gradually decreases upwards as a result of grain size increase. The resistivity log has a particularly distinctive 'wine glass' shape which also reflects the gradual upward increase in grain size.|

12305|Mopunga Group|Extent|MOUNT PEAKE, NAPPERBY, BARROW CREEK, ALCOOTA, HUCKITTA, TOBERMORY, HAY RIVER, MOUNT WHELAN.|
12305|Mopunga Group|Relationships and boundaries|Overlies Wonnadinnna Dolostone with inferred disconformity, and Oorabra Arkose (both of Keepera Group) with disconformity or slight angular unconformity; where these are absent, unconformable on Palaeoproterozoic rocks. Disconformably overlain by Mount Baldwin Formation and Octy Formation or where these are absent, Red Heart Dolostone (all of Shadow Group) or Thorntonia Limestone and Gum Ridge Formation (both of Narpa Group).|
12305|Mopunga Group|Age reasons|Stratigraphic position above Marinoan-equivalent glacigene units and below fossiliferous Cambrian units indicates terminal Neoproterozoic age. Ediacara fauna in Central Mount Stuart Fomation and ichnofossil fauna of simple horizontal trails in Grant Bluff, Elkera and Central Mount Stuart Fomations are consistent with this age assignment.|

12305|Mopunga Group|Comments|(Orig. Defn) The Mopunga Group of Noakes (1957) as redefined by Smith (1964) is here redefined. In Smith's definition it comprised the Elyuah, Grant Bluff and Mt Baldwin Formations. Major unconformities are now recognised between the  Elyuah Formation sensu stricto and its former member, the Oorabra Arkose, and between the Elkera Formation (former upper Grant Bluff Formation) and the Mount Baldwin Formation. The name Mopunga Group is here applied to the unconformity-bounded tectosome comprised of the following formations: Gnallan-a-gea Arkose, Elyuah Formation, Grant Bluff Formation, Elkera Formation and Central Mount Stuart Formation (excluding the basal diamictite). This definition retains the name for the bulk of the units previously included, and extends its use laterally from the Huckitta Sheet onto the Tobermory, Hay River, Mt Whelan, Alcoota Barrow Creek and Mt Peake 1:250 000 Sheet area.|

24387|Mostyndale Mudstone Member|Name source|The name is derived from Mostyndale Holding, 13 km north-northeast of Springsure, on the Springsure 1:250 000 Sheet area.|
24387|Mostyndale Mudstone Member|Unit history|The Mostyndale Mudstone Member was informally referred to as the Lower Mudstone Member of the Cattle Creek Formation by Power (1966). Mollan & other (1969) included the unit in the Stanleigh Formation on Phillips (1960).|
24387|Mostyndale Mudstone Member|Type section locality|The type section (holostratotype) of the Mostyndale Mudstone Member is defined as a composite section from the cored stratigraphic bores GSQ Springsure 8 and 9. These holes were drilled on Orion Creek at 24o16'S; 148o13'E and 24o16'; 148o12'E respectively (Gray, 1976). The lowermost 178 m of the unit is represented by the interval 32 to 210 m in GSQ Springsure 9, and the uppermost 71 m by the interval 273 to 344 m in GSQ Springsure 8. Total thickness of the type section is 249 m. The lowermost 78 m of the type section comprise sandstone (53 percent) interbedded with shale, mudstone, and siltstone (47 percent). The sandstone is light grey, very fine to fine grained and in part silty, and is labile with an argillaceous and calcareous matrix. Bedding is commonly destroyed by bioturbation. The sandstone contains shell fossils and plant remains. Mudstone clasts and calcite veining are common. Shale, mudstone and siltstone are grey to black and sandy, with carbonised plant fragments, fossil shells, and pyritic nodules. The upper 171 m of the type section comprise dark grey to black mudstone and shale with minor siltstone. Fossil shells, pyritic nodules, limestone fragments, and iron-rich, ?sideritic siltstone beds (up to 0.3 m thick) occur throughout. Reference section: Two reference sections (hypostratotypes), one a composite cored section, and the other a reasonably well-exposed outcrop section, are nominated for the Mostyndale Mudstone Member. 1. The cored section in GSQ Springsure 15 (located at 24o02'54"S; 148o11'15"E) from surface to 266 m, and in GSQ Springsure 16 (located at 24o02'36"S; 148o13'30"E) from 584 to 897 m (total depth) provide a complete, overlapping section of the Mostyndale Mudstone Member. Because the overlap occurs in a monotonous shaly sequence, precise correlation between these two bores is more difficult to establish than in the type section. The only major lithological difference between this reference section and the type section occurs in the lower part of the unit, which in the reference section is composed mostly of silty mudstone, with two isolated sandstone intervals. In the type section, the corresponding interval is considerably more sandy.  2. The outcrop reference section is located in Springsure Creek, on Mostyndale, between GR 637006 and 638007 on the Springsure 1:250 000 Sheet. The section, which comprises several individual outcrops with intervening intervals of no exposure, is dominated by blue-grey silty mudstone, in part ferruginised, with beds of burrowed, sandy siltstone. Fine, calcareous grains occur in both siltstone and mudstone. Scattered granules and pebbles occur at some levels, and sandstone stringers are common. Red-brown concretions up to 0.5 m in diameter occur in one outcrop. Gypsum, probably of pedogenic origin, occurs in sheet-like beds up to 15 mm thick.|
24387|Mostyndale Mudstone Member|Extent|Surface: Crops out very poorly, with exposures generally discontinuous and deeply weathered. Incomplete exposures occur in Springsure Creek on Mostyndale; in a small, southerly flowing gully 2 km northeast of Stanleigh homestead; and in a tributary of Minerva Creek, approximately 2.5 km east of Crystal Plains homestead. Subsurface: The Mostyndale Mudstone Member was intersected in stratigraphic bores GSQ Springsure 8 and 9, (Orion Creek; Gray, 1976), and GSQ Springsure 15 and 16 (Arcturus Road; Balfe, 1982). Also intersected in petroleum exploration wells AFO Arcturus 1, AFO Inderi 1, and HOM Fernlees 1. In AOE 1 (Reids Dome) and AOE 2 (Reids Dome), sandstone occurs in a position stratigraphically ;similar to the Riverstone Sandstone Member, but the continuity of these sandstone intervals has not been demonstrated, and their equivalence is not proven. The Mostyndale Mudstone Member is therefore only tentatively identified in Reids Dome. South of Reids Dome and in the Consuelo Anticline to the east, the Mostyndale Mudstone Member cannot be differentiated from the Moorooloo Mudstone Member, since the Riverstone Sandstone Member is absent.|
24387|Mostyndale Mudstone Member|Thickness range|The thickness of the Mostyndale Mudstone Member ranges from a maximum of 425 m in the composite reference section from GSQ Springsure 15 and 16 to a minimum of 244 m in AFO Inderi 1. The type section is 249 m thick, and in HOM Fernless 1 the unit is 276 m thick.|
24387|Mostyndale Mudstone Member|Lithology|The Mostyndale Mudstone Member is composed mainly of dark grey mudstone. The proportion of silty material in the mudstone increases towards the top of the un;it. A variable amount of very fine, light grey sandstone is present in the lower part of the unit. At outcrop, the unit generally shows a blue-grey colour, and ferruginised concretions occur.|
24387|Mostyndale Mudstone Member|Fossils|The type section contains marine shell fossils, mainly brachiopods, which are scattered throughout the unit but are particularly abundant toward the bottom. The cored reference section in GSQ Springsure 15 and 16 contains bivalves, brachiopods, gastropods, crinoids, bryozoans, and very large foraminifera, some of which are more than 10 mm long. The large foraminifera appear to be strongly facies controlled, being confined to the more silty intervals. Large foraminifera and fish scales are present in the outcrop reference section in Springsure Creek. The fauna observed is consistent with an Early Permian age.|
24387|Mostyndale Mudstone Member|Relationships and boundaries|The Mostyndale Mudstone Member conformably overlies the Reids Dome Beds, and is conformably overlain by the Riverstone Sandstone Member of the Cattle Creek Formation. The lower boundary is taken at the base of the first bed of bioturbated, marine mudstone above the Reids Dome Beds. The upper boundary is placed at the top of the monotonous marine mudstone, beneath the first thick bed of sandstone.|
24387|Mostyndale Mudstone Member|Identifying features|Wireline logs: Wireline logs of the Mostyndale Mudstone Member exhibit the following characteristics: 1. A clearly defined lower boundary on both gamma-ray and resistivity logs. 2. Strong log differentiation between sandstone and mudstone in the lower part of the unit, particularly on the resistivity log. 3. A gradual upward increase in resistivity and decrease in gamma-ray intensity reflecting the gradual increase in average grain size from mud to silt.|

12441|Mount Albert Group|Constituents|The Mount Albert Group consists of the Deighton Quartzite, White Blow Formation, Roxmere Quartzite and Knapdale Quartzite.|
12441|Mount Albert Group|Extent|The formations of this Group are exposed discontinuously in the area bounded by 20o12'S and 21o6'S latitude and 139o47'E and 140o36'E longitude. The Deighton Quartzite and White Blow Formation occur in a north-trending strip 15 km wide at the west of this area, the Roxmere Quartzite occurs in the southeast and the Knapdale Quartzite occurs in the northeast.|
12441|Mount Albert Group|Thickness range|The Deighton Quaratzite and White Blow Formation have a total thickness of up to 3700 m. The Roxmere Quartzite is at least 1500 m thick and the Knapdale Quartzite is at least 2000 m thick.|
12441|Mount Albert Group|Lithology|The Quartzites contain sublabile quartzite, pebbly quartzite, minor conglomerate, calcareous sandstone, micaceous sandstone and minor siltstone and shale and phyllite. The White Blow Formation contains micaceous siltstone, limestone, calcareous rocks, slate, phyllite, schist and minor quartzite.|
12441|Mount Albert Group|Relationships and boundaries|The Group contains discontinuous remnants of the youngest sedimentary cycle recognised in the Middle Proterozoic sequence of the eastern succession. The three Quartzite Formations overlie the Corella Formation with apparent conformity in most areas, but locally the Deighton Quartzite shows angular relationships with older rocks. Because of their similar stratigraphic position, similar lithologies, and similar air-photo pattern they are considered to be equivalent. The Group is possibly a correlative of units A to D in the Surprise Creek Beds (Wilson et al., in prep.), and to parts of the Mammoth Formation (Cavaney, 1975) west of the Kalkadoon-Leichhardt basement block. The Deighton Quartzite grades abruptly upwards into a finer grained sequence and a similar transition occurs near the top of the Knapdale Quartzite, where minor stratabound copper mineralisation is located. Both of these Quartzites overlie sulphide-bearing shales towards the top of the Corella Formation.|
12441|Mount Albert Group|Age reasons|Precambrian, probably Carpentarian (Middle Proterozoic).|

24390|Mount Angelay Granite|Name source|Named after Mount Angelay, a prominent mesa at GR 763535, situated 7.5 km to E of the granite, Mount Angelay 1:100 000 Sheet area, Duchess 1:250 000 Sheet area.|
24390|Mount Angelay Granite|Unit history|Like all other granites in the eastern part of the Duchess 1:250 000 Sheet area, the Mount Angelay Granite was mapped as Williams Granite by Carter & Opik (1963).|
24390|Mount Angelay Granite|Type section locality|Hilly terrain in the vicinity of GR 635555, 2.5 km NE of Eureka homestead, Mount Angelay 1:100 000 Sheet area. Here there are extensive exposures of partly foliated, pink hornblende-biotite granite and minor biotite-rich granite and pegmatite.|
24390|Mount Angelay Granite|Extent|The granite forms an elongate body 28 km long, trending NNW and covering about 200 km2, west of the Cloncurry Fault in the centralpart of Mount Angelay 1:100 000 Sheet area, Duchess 1:250 000 Sheet area.|
24390|Mount Angelay Granite|Lithology|Consists of pinkish, locally foliated, medium to coarse-grained, mainly even-grained but locally porphyritic granite containing hornblende and/or biotite and/or clinopyroxene, and minor leucogranite, porphyritic microgranite, contaminated grey mafic-rich granite, aplite and pegmatite.|
24390|Mount Angelay Granite|Relationships and boundaries|The granite intrudes Doherty Formation and Soldiers Cap Group, is cut by E-trending dolerite dykes, and is overlain by flat-lying Mesozoic sediments. Intrusive contacts with the Doherty Formation are locally highly irregular and in places the granite cannot easily be distinguished from calc-silicate rocks.|

26050|Mount Darcy Microgranodiorite|Name source|Mount Darcy, a small but prominent conical hill at GR 7561-407816 (Forest Home 1:100 000 Sheet area), 7 km northeast of Prestwood homestead. "Mount Darcy" here conforms with local usage; most topographic maps show "Mount Darcy" incorrectly as the highest (but relatively inconspicuous) point on a mesa of Mesozoic sandstone 3 km to the northeast.|
26050|Mount Darcy Microgranodiorite|Unit history|Mapped (in part) as part of the Prestwood Microgranite, and in part included in "Forsayth Granite" by White (1959) and Branch (1966).|
26050|Mount Darcy Microgranodiorite|Type section locality|A small tor 1 km southeast of Mount Darcy (GR 7561-416811). Two phases of intrusive rock are present; both are porphyritic microgranodiorite, containing phenocrysts of quartz, plagioclase, and biotite, but lacking hornblende. The younger, light grey porphyry contains large xenoliths of the older phase, a darker rock with a finer-grained groundmass and less abundant phenocrysts. The younger phase contains about 30 percent by volume phenocrysts including prominent ellipsoidal quartz phenocrysts, a characteristic of the Mount Darcy Microgranodiorite. The older phase contains slightly rounded bipyramidal B-quartz phenocrysts; it may have been intruded originally as a dyke swarm. Xenoliths of Forsayth Granite are also abundant in the Microgranodiorite.|
26050|Mount Darcy Microgranodiorite|Extent|Numerous small intrusive bodies in the Mount Darcy-upper Crooked Creek-upper Dismal Creek area; larger bodies to the south in the Somerset Creek area, on both sides of the Gulf Developmental Highway, where there are also numerous roof pendants and inclusions of Forsayth Granite; small bodies crop out between Mount Darcy and Mount Turner.|
26050|Mount Darcy Microgranodiorite|Lithology|The unit consists predominantly of the younger phase described above; it contains between 20 and 80 percent (by volume) phenocrysts. In the area either side of the highway between Somerset Creek and Crooked Creek, porphyritic hornblende-biotite microgranodiorite is intimately mixed with, and appears to intrude the biotite microgranodiorite, but could not be mapped out separately at 1:100 000 scale. Apart from a tendency for its quartz phenocrysts to be bipyramidal rather than ellipsoidal, the hornblende-bearing rock is difficult to distinguish from the biotite microgranodiorite in outcrop. A further, still younger phase occurs as narrow dykes cutting both the biotite and hornblende-biotite microgranodiorites in the Somerset Creek area. It is a green hornblende microgranodiorite containing about 20 percent by volume of hornblende and plagioclase phenocrysts; quartz phenocrysts are not common. Mount Darcy Microgranodiorite is commonly associatead with areas of brecciation, and of intense quartz-sericite (and, locally, potassic) alteration as affecting both porphyry and country rocks. At Mount Darcy itself, intensely sericitised porphyry surrounds a small breccia pipe. The "Phyllis May" and Mount Turner Cu-Mo prospects are associated with Mount Darcy Microgranodiorite.|
26050|Mount Darcy Microgranodiorite|Relationships and boundaries|Intrudes Proterozoic Aurora, Delaney, and Forsayth Granites. Occurs as small irregularly-shaped plutons ranging from several hundred metres to several kilometres across. Some of these "plutons" may be dyke swarms, but if so, the screens of granitic country rock rarely crop out. Mount Darcy Microgranodiorite intrudes Dismal Creek Volcanics, and is probably intruded by Prestwood Microgranite. The hornblende-bearing "phases" may, at least in part, be equivalent to Mount Sircom Microgranodiorite.|
26050|Mount Darcy Microgranodiorite|Age reasons|Probably Carboniferous. Intrudes Dismal Creek Volcanics, which are probably mid-Carboniferous, but is probably comagmatic with at least part of the Volcanics. At Mount Turner cuts rhyolite dykes that are related to the mid-Carboniferous Newcastle Range Volcanics (Black, 1973) or the time-equivalent(?) Maureen Volcanics.|

26315|Mount Helpman Member|Geomorphic expression|The unit forms gently to moderately hilly terrain and is commonly topographically more prominent than adjacent parts of the Robertson River Formation. Differential weathering and erosion have picked out well-defined bedding trends in some areas.|
26315|Mount Helpman Member|Type section locality|In Bull Creek from GR 723132 downstream to 714147 (inferred to be the base and top of the unit respectively).

The maximum thickness (if no repetition had occurred) is about 1200 m. However the sectionspecified is typical of the unit as presently mapped. The most accessible outcrops in the type section are in Bull Creek, near where it is crossed by the track between Robin Hood and the Forsayth-Agate Creek road, and are characteristic of the unit; they consist of alternating quartz-mica schist and micaceous quartzite layers from several centimetres to a metre thick. In some of the quartzite layers flattened ellipsoids containing calc-silicate minerals are present.|
26315|Mount Helpman Member|Extent|In the Forsayth 1:100 000 Sheet area, the unit has been mapped as a sinuous belt extending northwest from the site of Old Robin Hood homestead, along the Little Robertson River to near its junction with the Robertson River, and thence east-northeast towards the Newcastle Range, mainly on the southern side of the Robertson River, but extending north of it in the Quartz Blow Creek area. Two areas of outcrop have been assigned to the member in the Georgetown 1:100 000 Sheet area. One is a crudely triangular area extending south from the abandoned City of Glasgow gold mine to an easterly line from Lornevale homestead to the Newcastle Range. The other is an area 7.5 km by 6 km in the headwaters of Daniel Creek. In the Gilberton 1:100 0000 Sheet area the unit has not been mapped out, but its eqivalents have been recognised in several sections of the lower part of the Robertson River Formation which have been examined in detail: (a) in a reference section of the lower part of the Robertson River Formation along the Percy River (Withnall & Mackenzie, 1980);  (b) near the Eight Mile Waterhole on the Gilbert River;  and (c) along the Gilbert River for several kilometres upstream of its junction with Six Mile Creek.|
26315|Mount Helpman Member|Thickness range|The thickness of the unit as mapped cannot be determined because of the repetition by complex isoclinal folding. However the equivalent rocks in the Gilberton area are only of the order of several hundred metres thick.|
26315|Mount Helpman Member|Lithology|Quartz-mica schist and micaceous quartzite as in the type section are the main rock-types in the unit as presently mapped. Quartzite constitutes up to 30 percent of the unit. Spots of calc-silicate minerals are locally present in quartzite. The rocks are all metamorphosed in the amphibole facies. In the Gilberton area, the equivalents of the Mount Helpman Member are much lower in metamorphic grade and less deformed. They consist of cleaved shale and siltstone with prominent thick, laminated and trough cross-laminated sub-labile to quartzose sandstone beds, commonly containing ellipsoidal calcareous concretions up to 1 m across. Some of the beds are also calcareous.|
26315|Mount Helpman Member|Relationships and boundaries|The unit is a member of the lower part of the Robertson River Formation which is part of the Etheridge Group (Withnall & Mackenzie, 1980). The equivalents in the Gilberton area occupy a position midway between the base of the formation and the Dead Horse Metabasalt Member. A similar position is inferred in the Forsayth area. Amphibolite containing relict amygdales crops out in Bull Creek downstream from the type section. The Mount Helpman Member is recognised by a marked increase in the abundance of quartzite relative to schist, compared with the rest of the Robertson River Formation.|
26315|Mount Helpman Member|Age reasons|A minimum age of 1570+/-20 m.y. (mid-Proterozoic) was obtained for the Etheridge Group by dating the earliest deformational-metamorphic event in the Einasleigh Metamorphics (Black & others, 1979).|

24400|Mount Hogan Granite|Name source|Mount Hogan homestead at GR 976 791 (Gilberton 1:100 000 Sheet area); also the old Mount Hogan gold mines centred around GR 948 765 occur within the granite.|
24400|Mount Hogan Granite|Unit history|Previously mapped as Robin Hood Granite (White, 1962).|
24400|Mount Hogan Granite|Type section locality|Group of tors around GR 942 778, 2.5 km southwest of Mount Hogan homestead and 1.5 km northwest of the main group of gold mines. Cream to grey and pink medium to coarse equigranular biotite granite crops out.|
24400|Mount Hogan Granite|Extent|A roughly semi-circular pluton 7 km in diameter and 30 km2 in area centred at about GR 950 800 (Gilberton 1:100 000 Sheet area).|
24400|Mount Hogan Granite|Lithology|Mainly medium to coarse equigranular to slightly porphyritic biotite granite, grey when fresh but commonly pink or reddish brown, due to mild alteration. Aplite or fine grained pink leucogranite veins occur in the northern part of the pluton. Around the southeastern and southern margins the granite contains shallowly dipping zones of intense chlorite-sericite alteration which host gold-silver-uranium mineralisation in quartz veins.A characteristic feature of the granite is its high radiometric background (3 to 5 times as high as that in the metamorphics).|
24400|Mount Hogan Granite|Relationships and boundaries|Intrudes the Proterozoic Robertson River and Bernecker Creek Formations and also metadolerite sills within the former. Intruded by late Palaeozoic andesite, rhyolite and microdiorite dykes.|
24400|Mount Hogan Granite|Age reasons|Probably late Proterozoic. The pluton truncates and therefore post-dates large-scale folds outlined in the country rocks by metadolerite sills; mapping has demonstrated that these structures also fold the slaty cleavage produced by the first deformation in the area, and are therefore probably second or possibly third generation folds. The second and third deformations have been dated at about 1470 and 970 m.y. respectively (Black & others, 1979). An imprecise Rb/Sr total rock isochron on a sample of Mount Hogan Granite indicates the unit is more likely to be Precambrian than Palaeozoic in age (L.P. Black, pers. comm.).|

Warrina Park Quartzite: 35-150 m, orthoquartzite, feldspathic quartzite, conglomerate. Total of approximately 4800 m.|
12822|Mount Isa Group|Geomorphic expression|Most formations of the group form valleys; however, the Breakaway Shale forms a series of prominent hills and ridges, the Urquhart Shale is generally exposed as discontinuous, iron-stained ridges; and the Warrina Park Quartzite forms prominent silicified ridges and hogbacks.|
12822|Mount Isa Group|Type section locality|The upper seven formations in the Mount Isa Group were first described by Bennett (1965), but the location of their type sections have not been published. The following type sections are based on an unpublished report for Mount Isa Mines Ltd (Battey, 1962); metric grid references have been added. Magazine Shale: North of King Gully, from 6756-407172 to 6756-405172.  Kennedy Siltstone: North of King Gully, from 6756-410104 to 6756-407104. Spear Siltstone: At Spear Creek, from 6756-412145 to 6756-409145. Urquhart Shale: King Gully, from 6756-425107 to 6756-413103. Native Bee Siltstone: East of the Mount Isa Golf Course, from 6756-427030 to 6756-421030. Breakaway Shale: East of the Leichhardt River crossing on the Mount Isa-Lake Moondarra road, from 6856-444120 to 6756-433120. Moondarra Siltstone: Southeast of Lake Moondarra, from 6856-505195 to 6856-495201. These formations and the Warrina Park Quartzite are all present in an east-west reference section near Depot Creek and King Gully, 3.5 km north of Mount Isa Post Office.|
12822|Mount Isa Group|Extent|In a north-trending belt, 1 to 10 km wide, from a point 30 km south of Mount Isa to near the Leander Range, 48 km north of Mount Isa. An outlier of the Group was mapped by Carter et al. (1961) 80 km south of Mount Isa, and there is another outlier in the Crystal Creek area, 80 km north of Mount Isa.|
12822|Mount Isa Group|Relationships and boundaries|The Mount Isa Group overlies Myally Subgroup and Eastern Creek Volcanics unconformably, and 'Mammoth Formation' correlatives either conformably or unconformably. It is intruded by a few dolerite and diorite dykes.|
12822|Mount Isa Group|Age reasons|The Group is probably younger than 1570+/-12 m.y., the age of the Sybella Granite, which is overlain by rocks probably equivalent to the Mount Isa Group (Plumb & Derrick, 1975). Ages determined from lead in the Urquharat Shale range between 1500 and 1600 m.y. (Richards, 1963); Ostic et al., 1967; Cooper et al., 1969).|

24401|Mount Juliet Granite|Unit history|Previously mapped as Forsayth Granite (White, 1962).|
24401|Mount Juliet Granite|Type section locality|Outcrops in Ellendale Creek at GR 020541 (Mount Surprise 1:100 000 Sheet area) consist of coarse-grained porphyritic biotite-muscovite granite with abundant muscovite 'books' up to 1 cm across and sub-equant K-feldspar phenocrysts generally 1 to 2 cm, but up to 6 cm in size.|
24401|Mount Juliet Granite|Extent|A roughly circular pluton about 16 km2 in area, situated about 9 km east-northeast of Einasleigh.|
24401|Mount Juliet Granite|Lithology|Whitish-grey to pink, medium to coarse-grained equigranular to slightly porphyritic biotite-muscovite granite to granodiorite. Muscovite flakes are up to 1 cm across. Sparse white to pink K-feldspar megacrysts are found in places and are generally 1 to 2 cm in size (rarely up to 6 cm). Locally a foliation is present.|
24401|Mount Juliet Granite|Relationships and boundaries|The granite intrudes the Proterozoic Einasleigh Metamorphics. The eastern edge of the pluton is in contact with the Mount Webster Granodiorite; however, no contact relationships have been observed.|
24401|Mount Juliet Granite|Age reasons|The granite is probably Middle Proterozoic in age, because it is locally foliated. However, some known Siluro-Devonian granitoids, such as the Dumbano Granite, are weakly foliated, so that a Siluro-Devonian age is a possibility for the Mount Juliet Granite.|

12886|Mount Les Siltstone|Name source|From Mount Les, a small hill at grid ref. 857230, in the southwestern Hedleys Creek 1:100 000 Sheet area. The name is best known as applied to the Mt Les Prospect near Gorge Creek 0.5 km south of Mount Les.|
12886|Mount Les Siltstone|Unit history|Included by Carter (1959) in the Wollogorang Formation, a name now restricted to an older formation in the Tawallah Group in the McArthur Basin. Roberts et al. (1963) included Mount Les Siltstone in the Fickling Beds, which now become the Fickling Group.|
12886|Mount Les Siltstone|Type section locality|About 90 m of finely laminated shale and siltstone, with some dolomite interbeds. The base is at grid reference 906243, abut 5 km east-northeast of the Mt Les prospect; the section runs 450 m in a southeasterly direction along a mining company track.|
12886|Mount Les Siltstone|Extent|Exposed over 30 km in the southwestern Hedleys Creek 1:100 000 Sheet area, Queensland, and the eastern part of the adjacent Seigal Sheet area, Northern Territory.|
12886|Mount Les Siltstone|Thickness range|55-90 m|
12886|Mount Les Siltstone|Lithology|Black dolomitic siltstone and black and white shale; interbeds of pink and brown dolomite in western outcrops.|
12886|Mount Les Siltstone|Relationships and boundaries|Conformably overlies Walford Dolomite; boundary is sharp in most areas because the upper layers of the Walford Dolomite have been altered to chert. The boundary is gradational in places, as interbeds of dolomite occur in Mount Les Siltstone. The upper contact is a disconformity in most places, and around grid reference 135255 in the eastern Seigal Sheet area the Mount Les Siltstone has been completely eroded, and Doomadgee Formation lies unconformably on Walford Dolomite.|
12886|Mount Les Siltstone|Age reasons|Proterozoic-Carpentarian. Correlation of part of the underlying Peters Creek Volcanics with the Hobblechain Rhyolite Member of the Masterton Formation in the McArthur Basin suggest an age of less than 1575 m.y. (age of the Hobblechain Rhyolite Mbr). Younger age limit provided by 1280 m.y. old dolerites which intrude equivalents of the South Nicholson Group, which unconformably overlies Mount Les Siltstone.|

23827|Mount Newsome Granodiorite|Geomorphic expression|The granodiorite forms gentle to moderately undulating terrain with sporadic boulder-sized and rarer platform outcrop. The central part of the pluton is poorly exposed and unweathered outcrop is very rare.   The Mount Newsome Granodiorite is similar in character on Landsat TM images to the eastern area of the Kilmarnock Granodiorite, although the former does exhibit a brownish hue to the west where there is abundant Cainozoic wash. Moderate magnetic anomalies (lower than for the Kilmarnock Granodiorite) are associated with this unit. Significant decreases in magnetisation occur along and proximal to northwest and north trending lineaments. Radiometrically, the Mount Newsome Granodiorite contrasts strongly with the Kilmarnock Granodiorite. It has weak to moderate K and very low Th and U responses.|
23827|Mount Newsome Granodiorite|Type section locality|At 8351-505251 in the northwest of the pluton, 3 km west of Mount. The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.|18/MAR/08
23827|Mount Newsome Granodiorite|Description at type locality|Grey, fine to coarse-grained, porphyritic biotite-hornblende granodiorite.|
23827|Mount Newsome Granodiorite|Extent|A large subequant pluton, 380 km2 in area, from Mount Mica homestead in the north to Silver Hills homestead in the south.|
23827|Mount Newsome Granodiorite|Lithology|Dominantly a grey, fine to coarse-grained, equigranular to porphyritic biotite-hornblende granodiorite.|
23827|Mount Newsome Granodiorite|Relationships and boundaries|Intrudes the Anakie Metamorphic Group, the Gem Park Granite and Whitdale Granodiorite, and is probably intruded by the Keilambete Tonalite. An east-trending line of small, leucocratic, tourmaline-bearing granite bodies intrude the unit north of Mount Leura. The unit is unconformably overlain by the Late Devonian to Early Carboniferous Silver Hills Volcanics and sedimentary rocks of the Drummond Basin, and belts of Cainozoic sediments including gravels and silcrete, along and adjacent to Tomahawk Creek. Numerous small basalt plugs of the Hoy Basalt intrude the unit.  Local outcrop, up to 3 km2 in area, of light grey, fine-grained biotite granite similar to the Central Creek Granodiorite are also present. The origin of these granite outcrops is uncertain. They could later intrusions related to the Central Creek Granodiorite, or may be derived from the granodiorite by fractionation, or represent assimilation of metasedimentary rock like the Mount Observatory Granite.  South of Whitdale, cream to pink, fine to coarse-grained, equigranular garnet-muscovite-biotite granite dykes, and associated veins of aplite and pegmatite (up to 30 cm wide), intrude the Mount Newsome Granodiorite. The origin of the dykes and veins is uncertain. They could be a product of partial melting of metasedimentary country rocks by the granodiorite, or the intrusion of late-stage fractionated material.|07/FEB/11
23827|Mount Newsome Granodiorite|Age reasons|Webb & McDougall (1968) obtained a K-Ar biotite age corrected to 370 Ma. Rb-Sr dating of several biotite-whole rock samples by P. Carr (unpublished data) gave an age range of 372 to 382 Ma (Middle Devonian).|

Mount Norna is plotted incorrectly on the Cloncurry 1:250 000 topographic map (SF 54-2 edition 1) and on the Cloncurry 1:100 000 topographic map (7056) but it is shown in its correct position on the 1:39 600 topographic map in Honman (1939). The Mount Norna mine (otherwise known as the Mountain Home or Mount Norma mine) occurs on the northeast slopes of the mountain.|
12978|Mount Norna Quartzite|Geomorphic expression|This formation is generally ridge forming and has a rugged to gently rounded surface. The metabasalt and dolerite are mostly expressed as valleys.|
12978|Mount Norna Quartzite|Type section locality|The middle portion of the type section that was used by Carter et al. (1961) to define the Soldiers Cap Formation is the proposed type section of the Mount Norna Quartzite. It commences at a point 800 m southeast of the Mountain Home (Mount Norna) mine at latitude 20o55'20"S, longitude 140o42'10"E (7056 690862) and exteands for 2.5 km in an east-northeasterly direction to a point at latitude 20o54'40"S, longitude 140o43'30"E (7056 713875). This section contains from west to east, 650 m of cross-bedded quartzite, meta-siltstone and phyllite, 150 m of metabasalt with thin quartzite intercalations, and about 1500 m of cross-bedded quartzite, phyllite, chert and silicified siltstone.|
12978|Mount Norna Quartzite|Extent|The Mount Norna Quartzite occurs in a complex tightly folded zone and crops out discontinuously between 8 km north and 120 km southeast of Cloncurry. Outcrop in the Cloncurry 1:100 000 Sheet area has been mapped in detail by Glikson & Derrick (1970); exposures in the Mount Angelay & Selwyn 1:100 000 Sheet areas have been delineated by private company work and air-photo interpretation.|
12978|Mount Norna Quartzite|Thickness range|The thickness of this formation ranges from 1300 m in the north to 2700 m in the south.|
12978|Mount Norna Quartzite|Lithology|Metamorphosed cross-bedded sandstone, feldspathic sandstone, siliceous siltstone and phyllite, with numerous intercalations of metabasalt and amphibolites. Skarn, quartzofeldspathic gneiss and gahnite quartzite are associated with zinc mineralisation in a belt extending from the Fullarton River south to the McKinlay River.|
12978|Mount Norna Quartzite|Relationships and boundaries|The Mount Norna Quartzite overlies the Llewellyn Creek Formation conformably, and is overlain conformably by the Toole Creek Volcanics and unconformably by the Corella Formation, Roxmere Quartzite and Mesozoic sediments.

12978|Mount Norna Quartzite|Comments|Remarks: Honman (1939) included this unit in his Upper or Volcanic stage of the Soldiers Cap series. Carter et al. (1961) described this succession as "interbedded metabasalts and medium-grained quartzite (with subordinate pelites)", but did not formally define it as a subdivision of the Soldiers Cap Formation. Glikson & Derrick (1970) used the name Weatherly Creek Quartzite for these rocks in an unpublished BMR Record but Glikson (1972) later published the informal stratigraphic term Mount Norna Quartzite. In Plumb & Derrick (1975) the unit is called the Weatherly Creek Quartzite. The publication by Glikson (1972) of the geographic term Mount NOrna has precedence over the alternative term, Weatherly Creek. The Mount Norna Quartzite appears to be host to stratabound zinc mineralisation of the Broken Hill type.B43|

23828|Mount Observatory Granite|Geomorphic expression|The granite forms gentle to moderately undulating terrain, with local tors, such as at Mount Observatory in the northwest where extensive rocky platforms cover about 1 km2. Such exposures are rare, the granite mostly forming isolated boulder-sized outcrop.  On the Landsat 5 TM (1-4-7 BGR) image, the Mount Observatory Granite is represented by a diffuse bluish hue.

23828|Mount Observatory Granite|Lithology|Grey to light grey, fine to medium-grained biotite granite with common metasedimentary xenoliths up to 1 m and sparse quartz eyes. Biotite clots or glomercrystic intergrowths up to 4 mm across are also a characteristic feature.|
23828|Mount Observatory Granite|Relationships and boundaries|Intrudes the Monteagle Quartzite of the Anakie Metamorphic Group. It is faulted against the Kilmarnock Granodiorite along the Kettle Creek Fault, but the intrusive relationships with that unit are unknown.

13029|Mount Philp Breccia|Name source|Revision of Mount Philp Agglomerate defined by Carter & others (1961) and revised by Derrick, Wilson & Hill (1977). Derivation: Named after Mount Phillp in S of Mary Kathleen 1:100 000 Sheet area, Cloncurry 1:250 000 Sheet area (Carter & others, 1961).|
13029|Mount Philp Breccia|Unit history|Mount Philp Agglomerate (Carter & others, 1961; Carter & Opik, 1963; Derrick & others, 1977).|
13029|Mount Philp Breccia|Type section locality|As selected by Carter & others (1961) the type section for the Mount Philp Agglomerate is from the edge of the unit, southeast of Ballara, to the waterhole at Latitude 20o58'25"S, Longitude 139o59'20"E. Derrick & others (1977), in their revision of the unit, stated that the type section extends 2.5 km SE from the edge of the outcrop of the formation about 0.5 km SE of the abandoned township of Ballara to a large waterhole on Read Creek. However, the waterhole referred to by Carter & others is probably Pelican Waterhole rather than one on Reid Creek some 2 km to the north. Pelican Waterhole is at about Latitude 20o59'00"S, Longitude 139o58'20"E, GR 932792, Mary Kathleen 1:100 000 Sheet area. The best exposures of the unit are rock plataforms at Pelican Waterholeand for about 200 m upstream to the west, and it is proposed that these exposures be considered the type area for the Mount Philp Breccia. Here the unit consists of angular to slightly rounded fragments mostly of amphibolitic metabasalt, calc-silicate rocks and pegmatite, enclosed in a bright pink, fine-grained igneous-textured rock containing small euhedral amphibole and magnetite phenocrysts.|
13029|Mount Philp Breccia|Extent|The main outcrop of the un;it covers about 15 km2 in SE corner of Mary Kathleen and NE corner of Duchess 1:100 000 Sheet areas, and other outcrops are present to the S, in the E part of the Duchess 1:100 000 Sheet area, Cloncurry and Duchess 1:250 000 Sheet areas.|
13029|Mount Philp Breccia|Lithology|The unit consists of breccia formed of disoriented and mainly angular fragments, some several metres across, of various rock types - metabasalt, amphibolite, banded and massive calc-silicate granofels, quartzite, micaceous schist, albitite, quartz-feldspar pegmatite - enclosed in a pink to red igneous-textured groundmass formed of small euhedral amphibole and magnetite phenocrysts and fine-grained subhedral albite laths. Most of the rock types present as fragments in the breccia can be matched with rock types present in adjacent Corella Formation.|
13029|Mount Philp Breccia|Relationships and boundaries|The breccia cuts banded calc-silicate rocks mapped as Corella Formation and is intruded by meta-dolerite.|
13029|Mount Philp Breccia|Age reasons|Proterozoic.|
13029|Mount Philp Breccia|Proposed publication|Blake & others, in prep. - see References|
13029|Mount Philp Breccia|Comments|Remarks: Fragments in the breccia are mostly derived from the adjacent Corella Formation, and were metamorphosed before being incorporated in the breccia. The unit is therefore much younger than the Corella Formation, and is no longer regarded as part of the Mary Kathleen Group. Textures and field relationships indicate an intrusive rather than an extrusive origin;. For these reasons the name of the unit is changed from Mount Philp Agglomerate (which implies a volcanic origin) to Mount Philp Breccia (a descriptive, rathern than genetic, lithological designation).|

24404|Mount Sircom Microgranodiorite|Name source|Mount Sircom pastoral holding, within which the southern parts of the microgranodiorite crop out; Mount Sircom, a prominent, solitary group of hills, at GR 7561-433578, however the unit is not exposed at this locality.|
24404|Mount Sircom Microgranodiorite|Unit history|Interpreted by White (1959) and Branch (1966) as part of the Prestwood Microgranite, which is a biotite microgranite rather than a biotite-hornblende microgranodiorite.|
24404|Mount Sircom Microgranodiorite|Geomorphic expression|Forms subdued rolling grasslands with areas of alluvium or boggy black soil, and low knolls covered with rounded boulders mostly about 30 to 60 cm in diameter.|
24404|Mount Sircom Microgranodiorite|Type section locality|Hills just north of McDonald Creek, about GR 7561-498667; this area is representatiave of the most common, more biotite-rich variant of the microgranodiorite.|
24404|Mount Sircom Microgranodiorite|Extent|Crops out over an area of about 15 km2 between the Gilbert River and the Cumberland Range (lower to middle reaches of McDonald Creek, and two unnamed creeks joining the Gilbert River to the south) in a hook-like shape. Extremities are at GR 7561-510680, -490607, -444610, and 453656, with the 3 km-deep embayment of the "hook" in the southeast.|
24404|Mount Sircom Microgranodiorite|Lithology|Strongly porphyritic biotite-hornblende microgranodiorite,* with large phenocrysts of quartz, plagioclase and alkali feldspar, and smaller phenocrysts of altered hornblende and biotite. The rock is commonly pink or grey in hand specimen, with pink alkali feldspar and green plagioclase phenocrysts. Richer in hornblende and poorer in biotite in places (e.g. central western portion).|
24404|Mount Sircom Microgranodiorite|Relationships and boundaries|Intrudes Robertson River and Townley Formations, without noticeable contact effects. In one place there is indisputable evidence that it intrudes part of the Cumberland Range Volcanics, which are similar to and correlated with (in time, at least) some of the Newcastle Range Volcanics, dated by Black (1973) at 318+/-5 m.y.  The Mount Sircom Microgranodiorite is therefore considered to be mid-Carboniferous.  Somewhat similar rocks, which may in part be equivalent, occur in the Mount Darcy Microgranodiorite.|

26058|Mount Start Member|Type section locality|A section from west to east across Mount Start, latitude 20o59'S, longitude 140o17'E. This section consists of 90 m of intricately folded laminated fine-grained calcareous sandstone and siliceous shale.|
26058|Mount Start Member|Extent|In the Marraba 1:100 000 Sheet area this member forms a nearly continuous thin band in the Duck Creek and Bulonga anticlines. It probably extends south into the Malbon 1:100 000 Sheet area.|
26058|Mount Start Member|Thickness range|Thickness ranges from about 120 m in the east to about 10 m in the west.|
26058|Mount Start Member|Lithology|Laminated fine-grained calcareous sandstone, quartzite, crenulated siliceous shale, friable decalcified sandstone. Some of the crenulated bedding may be of algal origin. Leaching and silicification are restricted to the elevated parts of the member.|
26058|Mount Start Member|Relationships and boundaries|The Mount Start Member is underlain conformably by the Cone Creek Metabasalt Member, and overlain conformably by the Timberoo Member of the Marraba Volcanics.|
26058|Mount Start Member|Comments|Remarks: The Mount Start Member is present as a narrow, low ridge in the vicinity of the Marraba Volcanics type section (I.e., near latitude 20o53'S, longitude 150o14'E (Carter et al., 1961) but this outcrop is not wide enough to be shown on the Marraba 1:100 000 Geological Sheet. The member has been delineated 11 km along strike to the southwest of the type section and in areas to the north and east.|

24405|Mount Webster Granodiorite|Type section locality|Along the north-south trending fence-line, about 2 km west of Sandy Creek, from where it meets another fence at GR 152666 (Mount Surprise 1:100 000 Sheet area) south to where it turns east at GR 147610. Outcrops consist of pale pinkish-grey medium-grained, equigranular, muscovite-biotite granodiorite, which is slightly foliated in places and locally cut by pegmatitic veins.|
24405|Mount Webster Granodiorite|Description at type locality|GR 123450 (Einasleigh 1:100 000 Sheet area), where pinkish-grey fine to medium-grained equigranular biotite granodiorite containing minor muscovite is exposed. The granodiorite in this area is characterised by a strong, locally intense, steeply plunging lineation defined by elongate quartz and mica grains.|
24405|Mount Webster Granodiorite|Extent|An elongate batholith, about 200 km2 in araea, in the southern part of the Mount Surprise 1:100 000 Sheet area and extending into the Einasleigh Sheet area. The batholith has several large screens or roof pendants of metamorphics; and there is a northeast-trending 'hook'-shaped extension at its southern end.|
24405|Mount Webster Granodiorite|Lithology|As described at the type area and reference locality: pinkish-grey, fine to medium-grained, equigranular muscovite-biotite granodiorite, locally grading into granite. The rocks are weakly to strongly foliated and in thin section a mortar texture is commonly developed. Towards the southern end of the batholith a strong lineation defined by elongate quartz grains and mica aggregates is present. Enclaves of Einasleigh Metamorphics are locally abundant and large screens or roof pendants up to several kilometres long have been mapped.|
24405|Mount Webster Granodiorite|Relationships and boundaries|The unit intrudes the Proterozoic Einasleigh Metamorphics. On its western edge it is in contact with the Mount Juliet Granite but the intrusive relationship is not known. It is intruded by numerous uralitised dolerite dykes of probable late Palaeozoic age.|
24405|Mount Webster Granodiorite|Age reasons|Probably Middle Proterozoic, because of the local strong deformation evidenced by the lineation and mortar texture. A Siluro-Devonian age is a possibility, although nearby Siluro-Devonian granitoids such as the Puppy Camp Granodiorite do not show such intense deformation.|

13449|Munduran Creek Member|Unit history|Part of The Narrows Beds (Kirkegaard et al, 1970) and part of the Rundle Formation (Henstridge and Missen, 1982).|
13449|Munduran Creek Member|Type section locality|36 m of oil shale with minor interbeds of claystone and rare impersistent dolomite; from 83.8 to 120.3 m in drill hole ERD 169 (GR 300,999E, 7,380,998N Gladstone 1:100 000 topographic sheet). The dark yellowish-brown to olive brown oil shale contains two major greyish-green claystone beds (from 99.0 to 102.0 m and 111.2 to 115.9 m in type section). Minor clayey oil shale occurs interlayered with the claystone. Other claystone to clayey oil shale beds are recorded from 93.2 to 94.1 m and 96.1 to 97.0 m in type section. A rare yellowish-grey impure dolomite concentration is contained within the type section from 113.8 to 114.0 m. Cyclicity of lithologies is a feature, with oil shale grading upwards through clayey oil shale to claystone, commonly overlain by minor carbonaceous material. Cyclic alternation of lithologies occurs more frequently in the upper oil shale unit.|
13449|Munduran Creek Member|Extent|Subcrops in an area of about 36 km2 in The Narrows Graben, NW of Gladstone, Queensland. Spase weathered outcrops are recorded. The member has been identified from drill hole core.|
13449|Munduran Creek Member|Thickness range|36.5 m (estimated true thickness 35.9 m corrected for an apparent dip of 9o in ERD 169) in type section. Range of true thickness of the member as intersected in drill holes is 24.1 m to 52.0 m.|
13449|Munduran Creek Member|Lithology|Oil shale, dark yellowish-brown to olive brown; calcareous, carbonaceous and clayey cyclicity; very thinly to very thickly bedded (up to 5 m); laminated, brecciated and peloidal in part. Minor interbeds of greyish-green claystone; rare discontinuous yellowish-grey impure dolomite concentrations and very rare dark grey carbonaceous shale. Oil shale beds attenuate towards the east in The Narrows Graben with a corresponding increase in the commonly silty to sandy claystone. Claystone and brecciated clayey oil shale beds often show bioturbation features. Ostracode tests are abundant with minor gastropods, vertebrate remains (crocodile, turtle), fish elements and coprolites.|
13449|Munduran Creek Member|Relationships and boundaries|The member is conformable with the underlying Humpy Creek Member and is the generally sharp contact between calcareous oil shale and claystone. The upper boundary is conformable with the Telegraph Creek Member and is the contact between oil shale and claystone or, in places, the sharp contact between oil shale and dolomite. The member is faulted against Devonian to Carboniferous rocks of the Curtis Island Group along the western edge of The Narrows Graben.|

13635|Myally Subgroup|Name source|(For original definition see Carter, et al., 1961, p.97).  From Myally Creek, 185 km north of Mount Isa.|
13635|Myally Subgroup|Type section locality|The old type section of Myally Beds near Myally Creek is incomplete and faulted (Carter et al. 1961). A new type section of the subgroup cannot be specified because of slight variation in the distribution of the type sections of the constituent formations. However, two excellent reference sections can be noted; one, between Paroo and Conglomerate Creeks along the Mount Isa-Julius dam road, contains all type sections of the constituent formations, but not the type section of the Police Creek Siltstone Member, which is nevertheless present in the reference section. The centre of the section is 16 km southwest of Julius dam or 56 km north-northeast of Mount Isa, latitude 20o15'S, 139o37'E, and its thickness is 3770 metres. A second reference section is located along a line trending due west for 4 km from the Lochness mineral lease, 32 km northwest of Julius dam and 90 km north of Mt Isa. It contains all the constituent formations, and is about 3000 m thick.|
13635|Myally Subgroup|Extent|The subgroup extends from near Mount Isa up to 200 km north to the Myally Creek-Gregory Downs area. The belt is up to 70 km wide in the north, but narrows to an average width of 20 km in the south. Total extent of the subgroup is near 4000 km2.|
13635|Myally Subgroup|Thickness range|From top to bottom, the constituent formations and their thickness range are as follows: Lochness Formation - siltstone, sandstone, dolomite 400-1200 m.  Police Creek Siltstone Member - siltstone, rhyolite 0-400 m. Whitworth Quartzite - feldspathic quartzite 650-2000 m. Bortala Formation - quartzite, siltstone 80-700 m. Alsace Quartzite - quartzite 70-600 m.|
13635|Myally Subgroup|Lithology|The subgroup is a sandstone-siltstone sequence.|
13635|Myally Subgroup|Relationships and boundaries|The subgroup forms part of the Haslingden Group. It conformably overlies the Eastern Creek Volcanics, and is overlain unconformably by the Mount Isa Group, and conformably or disconformably by the Surprise Creek Beds. The Judenan Beds are probable equivalents of the Myally Subgroup, but until they are redefined, they are excluded from it.|
13635|Myally Subgroup|Age reasons|Carpentarian: minimum age of about 1650 m.y. set by Sybella Granite intrusive into the time equivalent units west of Mount Isa. Maximum age possibly near 1700 m.y. (Plumb & Derrick, 1975).|

Cavaney, pers. comm., 1975). Some areas of the Myally Beds are now mapped as Surprise Creek Beds.|
13663|Mytton Formation|Name source|Parish of Mytton, County of Philp.|
13663|Mytton Formation|Unit history|The unit was previously mapped as part of the Broken River Formation (now Group) (White, 1959, 1962, 1965).  The name was first published and described by Withnall & others (1988), but was not formally defined.|
13663|Mytton Formation|Geomorphic expression|.  Because of the abundant resistant sandstone beds, the unit generally forms hilly topography with well-defined strike ridges.|
13663|Mytton Formation|Type section locality|In the Broken River between 7859-589449 (base) and 578447 (top).  The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.   REFERENCE SECTION: (1) Gorge Creek between 7859-668513 (base) and 632517 (top) - the section is complexly folded, but is at least 940 m thick; (2) GSQ Clarke River 2 borehole from 139 m to 389.89 m (Law, 1986).|07/FEB/11
13663|Mytton Formation|Description at type locality|The section consists of 450 m of alternating mudstone and mainly fine-grained, medium to thick-bedded sublithic arenite.  See Withnall & others (1988, figure 31, and pages 64-66).|07/FEB/11
13663|Mytton Formation|Extent|A sinuous folded belt from the hinge of the Atherton Anticlinorium at about 7859-580550 around the hinge of the Broken River Anticlinorium to about 7858-670380 near 'Craigie'.  It also occurs in a narrow belt about 10 km long west of 'Pandanus Creek'.  The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.|
13663|Mytton Formation|Thickness range|450m at type section.|
13663|Mytton Formation|Lithology|Grey mudstone and very fine to coarse-grained sublithic arenite, and lesser granule to pebble conglomerate, oncolitic/oolitic conglomerate, and oolitic and bioclastic limestone.  The mudstones are massive and bioturbated or laminated, ripple cross-laminated with wave and current ripple marks.  Arenites are typically massive, graded, or laminated with dish structures, hummocky cross-stratification, flutes, and ripple marks.|
13663|Mytton Formation|Fossils|The Mytton Formation mainly contains lycopod fragments, and also minor tabulate corals, crinoid ossicles, brachiopods, bivalves, bryozoans, and rare stromatoporoids, trilobites and fish fragments.  In the Broken River-Gorge Creek area, the unit is nearly barren of fossils.|
13663|Mytton Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The Mytton Formation is the uppermost part of the Broken River Group.  It apparently conformably overlies the Papilio Mudstone, and is overlain with a slight angular unconformity by the Bulgeri Formation of the Bundock Creek Group.  It contains the Stanley Limestone Member. Near 'Pandanus Creek', it apparently conformably overlies the Chinaman Creek Limestone.|
13663|Mytton Formation|Age reasons|The age is late Givetian and possibly Frasnian (Mawson & Talent, unpublished data) based on fossil evidence.|

24415|Myubee Igneous Complex|Unit history|Mapped as dolerite and Wonga Granite by Carter & Opik (1963).|
24415|Myubee Igneous Complex|Type section locality|About 16.5 km N of Duchess, from GR 775546 to GR 798535. Here the complex consists of an outer zone of foliated, medium-grained biotite-hornblende granite with some aplite, leucogranite and pegmatite (mainly as veins), and an inner zone of gabbro; the lithologies are described below.|
24415|Myubee Igneous Complex|Extent|The complex forms a small circular outcrop about 1.5 to 2 km in diameter, 9 km NE of Myubee railway siding.|
24415|Myubee Igneous Complex|Lithology|The complex consists of a gabbro plug or stock, partly encircled by granite similar to the Revenue and Overlander Granites. The gabbro contains olivine, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, hornblende, plagioclase, primary biotite and opaque minerals, and locally, large inclusions of calc-silicate rocks. It is differentiated from olivine-rich norite through pyroxene gabbro, hornblende gabbro and hornblende leucogabbro containing small segregations of pegmatoidal diorite rich in coarse green hornblende and white feldspar grains, to pegmatoidal hornblende diorite. The gabbro is converted locally to medium-grained amphibolite around the margins where it is in contact with the granite, and is cut by veins of aplite, biotite leucogranite, foliated biotite granite, and pegmatite. The granite associated with the gabbro is porphyritic (in feldspar) to even-grained, medium-grained, generally strongly foliated and, locally, relatively rich in hornblende and especially biotite. It contains rare inclusions of coarse-grained granite and large pendants of calc-silicate rocks.|
24415|Myubee Igneous Complex|Relationships and boundaries|The Myubee Igneous Complex intrudes the Corella Formation and is cut by an apparently unmetamorphosed dolerite dyke.|
24415|Myubee Igneous Complex|Age reasons|Proterozoic.|
24415|Myubee Igneous Complex|Proposed publication|Blake & others, in preparation.|
24415|Myubee Igneous Complex|Comments|Remarks: The gabbro of the complex may be correlated with the dolerite of the Mount Erle Igneous Complex to the south, and with the Lunch Creek Gabbro in the Marraba 1:100 000 Sheet area to the northeast (Derrick, 1980). The potassic granite may be a correlative of the Revenue and Overlander Granites. The gabbro forms a net-veined complex with the granite. An analogous relationship exists to the south where the dolerite of the Mount Erle Igneous Complex is interpreted to be younger than the associated granite, and to the northeast where Derrick (1980) regarded the Lunch Creek Gabbro to be probably older than the closely associated Burstall Granite.|

24416|Mywyn Granite|Type section locality|A group of hills within grid square 3215 (Einasleigh 1:100 000 Sheet area). Grey, strongly foliated porphyritic biotite granite is exposed. The foliation is defined by aligned K-feldspar megacrysts up to 3 cm long and by flattened and aligned quartz grains. Some pegmatite veins and xenoliths of biotite gneiss occur in places.|
24416|Mywyn Granite|Extent|A small irregularly shaped pluton with maximum dimensions of 12 by 5 km, centred about 10 km east-southeast of Mywyn homestead; it has a strongly embayed margin and numerous roof pendants.|
24416|Mywyn Granite|Lithology|Grey to pink, generally strongly foliated, porphyritic biotite granite as described for the type area. K-feldspar megacrysts constitute almost 50 percent of the rock in some places. Where the foliation is weaker, the megacrysts are randomly orientated.|
24416|Mywyn Granite|Relationships and boundaries|The Mywyn Granite intrudes the Einasleigh Metamorphics.|
24416|Mywyn Granite|Age reasons|Probably Middle Proterozoic because of the strong foliation which mainly trends northeast to southeast. Foliation in the Siluro-Devonian granitoids, where present, is weaker and generally trends north to north-northeast.|

27295|Nancy Lee Sandstone Member|Name source|Nancy Lee mine, one of the abandoned mines of the Golden Gate group, GR 7361-270930.|
27295|Nancy Lee Sandstone Member|Unit history|Branch (1966) regarded the sandstone as an inlier of subvolcanic basement. Mackenzie (1983) informally named and described the 'Nancy Lee sandstone member').|
27295|Nancy Lee Sandstone Member|Geomorphic expression|The sandstone occurs in area of gentle slopes at the foot of rugged volcanic terrain farther to the east.|
27295|Nancy Lee Sandstone Member|Type section locality|The type section is the discontinuous creek-bed exposures of medium to coarse quartzofeldspathic, micaceous feldspathic, and, near the top, silicified quartzose sandstone between GR 7361-269934 (base) and -273935 (top). The section is about 140 m thick, based on an average dip of 20o.|
27295|Nancy Lee Sandstone Member|Extent|Outcrop is limited to an area about 3 km long and 0.5 km wide straddling Golden Gate Creek immediately east of the Golden Gate group of mines.|
27295|Nancy Lee Sandstone Member|Thickness range|The maximim thickness of the unit is estimated to be about 150 m based on an average dip of 20o; however, dip may be up to 30o, and maximum thickness 200 m. The unit lenses out less than 2 km north of Golden Gate Creek.|
27295|Nancy Lee Sandstone Member|Lithology|The unit consists of thinly bedded yellow-brown to purplish-brown medium to coarse quartzofeldspathic sandstone, banded pinkish-buff micaceous feldspathic sandstone, and silicified sandstone close to upper contact. A few silty layers up to 1 cm thick are present in places.|
27295|Nancy Lee Sandstone Member|Relationships and boundaries|Contacts with adjacent formations are not exposed, but the easterly dip of bedding indicates that the sandstone overlies the Parrot Camp Rhyolite to the west and is overlain by the Carron Rhyolite to the east. Spoil of Esmeralda Granite from the mines immediately to the west of the sandstone outcrop indicates that the sandstone is probably intruded by the granite.|
27295|Nancy Lee Sandstone Member|Age reasons|The age is Middle Proterozoic as for the rest of the Croydon Volcanic Group.|

24432|Nonda Granite|Unit history|The Nonda Granite was previously included in the Esmeralda Granite (White, 1959; Branch, 1966); it was informally named 'Nonda granite' and described by Mackenzie (1983).|
24432|Nonda Granite|Type section locality|2.5 km northeast of where Nonda Creek crosses the road from Croydon to Esmeralda homestead (about GR 7460-675493); outcrops consist of grey, fine-grained porphyritic biotite granite with sporadic graphitic and mafic inclusions.|
24432|Nonda Granite|Extent|Irregular stocks and apophyses ranging from a few hundred metres to several kilometres across crop out in the following areas: the Mount Cassiterite area (southeast Croydon); east of Stanhills Battery, and in the area surrounding Brennans Knob (southwest Gilbert River); on either side of the road to Esmeralda homestead, from Nonda Creek southward to Six Mile Waterhole (northwest Esmeralda); and about 18 km west-northwest of Glenora homestead (southeast Esmeralda).|
24432|Nonda Granite|Lithology|Grey, fine to medium, slightly porphyritic biotite granite to microgranite which typically outcrops as subangular to subrounded boulders less than 0.5 m across. The rock commonly contains graphite and/or lithic inclusions and tends to be quite dark in colour even though it generally has low mafic content and in some cases is actually leucocratic; dark colour may be due to disseminated graphite. Alteration is extensive; biotite is commonly chloritised and plagioclase is almost invariably seriticised. Graphic intergrowths of quartz and K-feldspar are common.|
24432|Nonda Granite|Relationships and boundaries|The Nonda Granite is considered to be a chilled marginal (roof) phase of the Esmeralda Granite, although a contact relationship has not been observed. It intrudes the Proterozoic Croydon Volcanic Group (specifically the Idalia Rhyolite, including the Democrat Rhyolite Member, and Carron Rhyolite), and is unconformably overlain by the Jurassic Hampstead Sandstone and Loth Formation, and the Jurassic-Cretaceous Gilbert River Formation.|
24432|Nonda Granite|Age reasons|The Nonda Granite is probably mid-Proterozoic in age; as mentioned above it is considered to be a marginal variant of the Esmeralda Granite which has a Rb-Sr muscovite age of 1444 Ma* (Black, 1973).   *Corrected using the 87Rb decay constant of 1.42 x 10-11yr-1 recommended by Steiger and Jager (1977).|

14388|Nundah Granodiorite|Name source|The formation is named after Nundah Creek which rises in and traverses a large area of granite country in the northwestern part of MUNGANA.|
14388|Nundah Granodiorite|Unit history|It was previously mapped as part of the Dargalong Metamorphics (Best, 1962;  de Keyser & Wolff, 1964;  de Keyser & Lucas, 1968) apart from the large pluton exposed about 9 km southwest of Chillagoe, which was tentatively assigned to the Forsayth Granite (Best, 1962).  The granitic rocks in the Cardross to Butterfly Spring area were informally referred to as Nundah Granite by Goudie (1976, 1978).|
14388|Nundah Granodiorite|Geomorphic expression|Hilly to gently undulating country with coarse gravelly soils and scattered rounded boulders and bouldery outcrops is extensively developed on the unit.  The granodiorite shows mainly as pale tones on aerial photographs.  Locally, medium tones predominate and in these areas the granodiorite is commonly very difficult to distinguish from Dargalong Metamorphics on aerial photographs.Subunit LP gnp forms low hilly country with scattered boulders and is characterised by pale tones on aerial photographs.|
14388|Nundah Granodiorite|Type section locality|The designated type locality is at GR 1935 81013, about 0.5 km southwest of Butterfly Spring, on the northern side of the track and east of a northerly trending tributary of Poison Creek, MUNGANA.|
14388|Nundah Granodiorite|Description at type locality|The formation is well exposed in this general area.  At Butterfly Spring it is unconformably overlain by an outlier of Mesozoic sandstone (Gilbert River Formation of the Carpentaria Basin sequence) and to the south it intrudes schist, gneiss and amphibolite of the Dargalong Metamorphics.|
14388|Nundah Granodiorite|Extent|The granodiorite crops out over ~510 km2 in northern MUNGANA and southern BELLEVUE.The granodiorite has two distinct modes of occurrence:(1)	as large discrete plutons whose contacts with the Dargalong Metamorphics are fairly sharp and discordant, and readily delineated on aerial photographs, and(2)	as irregular to elongate stocks containing numerous inclusions of metamorphic rocks (particularly in marginal zones) and as thin lenses and dykes oriented mainly parallel to the foliation in the metamorphics.  These units commonly form migmatitic complexes with quartzofeldspathic gneisses of the Dargalong Metamorphics and they are generally difficult to distinguish from the metamorphics on aerial photographs.SubunitLP gnp crops out over <5 km2, north of Muldiva Creek and about 13 km west of Mungana.|
14388|Nundah Granodiorite|General description|The granodiorite is cut by numerous faults and shear zones, particularly in the area between Butterfly Spring and Cardross dam.  A metamorphic foliation or, more rarely, a schistosity is commonly developed in the sheared granite (sensu lato) which tends to form ridges that are difficult to distinguish from rhyolite dykes on aerial photographs.  Some relatively long narrow zones of quartz-muscovite schist, interpreted as extensively sheared and altered granodiorite, have also been mapped.The Nundah Granodiorite shows abundant evidence (e.g., recrystallisation of grains - in particular quartz grains, undulose extinction in quartz and muscovite grains, bent muscovite and biotite flakes) of extensive deformation.  Most outcrops show a tectonic foliation defined mainly by the alignment of mica flakes.  Locally quartz grains in the granodiorite have recrystallised to elongate 'ribbons' which 'wrap around' large feldspar grains.MINERALISATION:  Fluorspar veins and small deposits of copper minerals are common along fractures and in shear zones which cut the Nundah Granodiorite.  Minor copper mineralisation has been found in the Nundah Granodiorite in the Dargalong - Mount Delaney area, southwest of Chillagoe.  The deposits are in veins filling fractures in the granodiorite and the lodes consist mainly of gossany chalcedony or vuggy quartz.  Gold has been mined at Mount Wandoo where the host rock is hydrothermally altered Nundah Granodiorite.  Books of muscovite, up to 30 cm square, in pegmatite veins and segregations have been reported from several localities.  The most productive mines were in the Mount Kitchen area, but reserves are low.  Rutile is patchily distributed throughout aplite and minor pegmatite of subunitLP gnp.  Minor deposits of antimony, arsenic, lead, tin, tungsten and zinc minerals have also been reported; most, if not all of these, are fracture controlled.|
14388|Nundah Granodiorite|Lithology|The formation in the type locality consists of white to pale grey, medium-grained biotite-muscovite granodiorite containing euhedral white potassium feldspar phenocrysts and coarse muscovite flakes.  Elsewhere the granodiorite is mainly medium to coarse grained, although pegmatitic and fine-grained variants also occur.  Textures range from megacrystic to equigranular;  porphyritic and seriate textures are common.  The granodiorite is locally heterogeneous, both texturally and compositionally, particularly adjacent to contacts with the gneissic country rocks of the Dargalong Metamorphics - granodiorite exposed near contacts with the Dargalong Metamorphics commonly contain biotite-rich schlieren and large (up to ~2 m x 1 m) inclusions of mica schist, gneiss and amphibolite.  The unit also contains minor pegmatite, as dykes and segregations and rare aplite (as pods).Quartz occurs mainly as anhedral, irregular grains which show highly undulose extinction.  Plagioclase (mainly oligoclase) is the dominant mineral in most outcrops.  Champion (1991) reported plagioclase compositions ranging from An16 to An27 in granites of the Blackman Gap Complex.................Biotite (pleochroic from dark red-brown or dark brown to pale yellow) forms mainly anhedral, ragged flakes, as well as scattered euhedral grains.  It occurs as discrete grains and small aggregates of flakes (commonly with minor muscovite)..............Muscovite is the most abundant mica in most outcrops. It occurs as small flakes scattered throughout the groundmass, as coarse flakes and megacrysts (up to 3 cm across), and as a partial replacement of plagioclase..............Accessory and secondary minerals include ilmenite, apatite, zircon, garnet, sphene, sericite, muscovite (secondary), chlorite, epidote and calcite.  Garnet is relatively common in some muscovite-rich leucogranites (sensu lato).............SubunitLP gnp consists of white to pink, fine to medium-grained, rutile-bearing aplite, together with minor pegmatite (as small irregular pods and segregations), muscovite leucogranodiorite and quartzofeldspathic gneiss................ALTERATION:  The granodiorite has undergone extensive hydrothermal alteration in several places, involving mainly sericitisation and silicification.  The alteration appears to be mainly fracture controlled and is probably related to the emplaced nearby of Late Palaeozoic rhyolite dykes and pods of porphyritic microgranite (sensu lato).|
14388|Nundah Granodiorite|Relationships and boundaries|The Nundah Granodiorite intrudes the Dargalong Metamorphics and is cut by numerous dykes of rhyolite (commonly flow banded) and dolerite (locally amygdaloidal) of probable Late Carboniferous age.|
14388|Nundah Granodiorite|Age reasons|The Nundah Granodiorite (as well as the granite of the Blackman Gap Complex - the other member of the Blackman Gap Supersuite) had, until recently, been interpreted to be Proterozoic.  A specimen collected from the pluton exposed east of the Dargalong group of mines reportedly yielded a K-Ar isotopic age (adjusted) of 1072 Ma (Table    ; Richards & others, 1966).  Subsequently, Silurian-Devonian ages were obtained on biotites from this specimen using Rb-Sr and K-Ar isotopic dating techniques (Black, 1973).  Black (1973) interpreted the relatively young ages to have most probably resulted from extensive resetting of both K-Ar and Rb-Sr mineral ages during a regional heating event at ~400 Ma.U-Pb zircon ion microprobe (SHRIMP) ages of ~430 Ma and 426 ± 7 Ma have recently been obtained on samples of the Nundah Granodiorite and Blackman Gap Complex, respectively (Table  ).  These indicate the Blackman Gap Supersuite was indeed emplaced in the Early Silurian and not the Proterozoic as previously thought.  The ages are similar to that (431 + 10- 21 Ma) obtained for the Dido Tonalite, in the Georgetown Province to the south (Black & McCulloch, 1990).|
14388|Nundah Granodiorite|Comments|The Nundah Granodiorite is characterised by relatively high Na2O, Sr, and Ba contents, and low K2O contents (Champion, 1991).  These characteristics indicate the granodiorite is infracrustal in origin (i.e., an I-type) despite its relatively high ASI (cf. White & others, 1986) and normative corundum contents.|

Between the yards and about GR 852050 medium-grained porphyritic biotite granodiorite crops out; from here to the Einasleigh-Kidston road, equigranular hornblende-biotite tonalite predominates; outcrops of calc-silicate gneiss are common along the first kilometre of the track, and leucogranite crops out between GR 848063 and GR 848057.|

14458|Oak River Granodiorite|Lithology|Grey medium grained biotite granodiorite with pink K-feldspar megacrysts; locally foliated. Subordinate grey foliated hornblende-biotite tonalite.|
14458|Oak River Granodiorite|Lithology|The unit consists of two main lithologies; a grey medium-grained porphyritic biotite granodiorite and an equigranular, locally hornblende-bearing, biotite tonalite. The porphyritic biotite granodiorite contains locally abundant, pink microcline megacrysts which are zoned, subsequent to lath-shaped crystals generally a few centrimetres long but up to 6 cm in places. Weak alignment of the megacrysts locally defines a foliation in the granodiorite. The equigranular hornblende-biotite tonalite which is most common in the eastern half of the batholith is characterised by ellipsoidal to spheroidal quartz grains up to 1 cm long and common mafic segregations, generally 2-3 cm long. The tonalite commonly has a foliation defined by biotite and the elongate quartz grains. A mortar texture is commonly developed.|

14458|Oak River Granodiorite|Relationships and boundaries|The unit intrudes the Proterozoic Einasleigh Metamorphics and associated leucogranitoid bodies. It is in contact with Proterozoic of Siluro-Devonian Eleven-B Granite and Quinine Spring Granite but the intrusive relationships are not known. Intruded by the Beverly Hills Granite and other leucogranitoids containing biotite and/or muscovite as well as mica-poor varieties. Intruded by numerous late Palaeozoic microgranite and rhyolite dykes. Unconformably overlain by the Carboniferous Newcastle Range Volcanics, Jurassic-Cretaceous sandstone and Cainozoic basalt.|
14458|Oak River Granodiorite|Age reasons|Proterozoic; intruded by the Proterozoic Digger Creek Granite (new name).|
14458|Oak River Granodiorite|Age reasons|The age of the Oak River Granodiorite is uncertain. It is intruded by the Beverly Hills Granite, a muscovite granite previously assigned to the Digger Creek Granite by Bain & others (1976) and Withnall & others (1976). The Digger Creek Granite is Precambrian in its type area and the Oak River Granodiorite was therefore also thought to be Precambrian. Four biotite/total rock pairs from the Oak River Granodiorite give Early Devonian Rb/Sr ages between 388 and 400 Ma (Black & Holmes, in preparation). Most samples of Oak River Granodiorite show thin section evidence of deformation and it is difficult to tell whether these are primary ages or have been reset. However, the whole lrock 87Sr/86Sr ratios are dissimilar to known Precambrian granitoids from the area and are almost identical to those for the Siluro-Devonian Robin Hool Granodiorite, suggesting that the Oak River Granodiorite is also of Siluro-Devonian age.|

14590|One Tree Granite|Unit history|Previously mapped as Kalkadoon Granite (Carter & Opik, 1963).|
14590|One Tree Granite|Type section locality|In vicinity of GR 733037, about 1 km W of station track, 12 km SSE of Stanbroke homestead, and 3 km NW of One Tree Tank, Dajarra 1:100 000 Sheet area. Here a southerly draining creek, a tributary of Boundary Creek, marks an approximate contact between the two main rock types of the unit: pink medium to coarse biotite granite, which forms tors and boulder-strewn hills to the west, and grey finer grained biotite-rich granite forming more subdued terrain to the east.|
14590|One Tree Granite|Extent|The unit crops out in a broad band 40 km long and up to 10 km wide trending N to NNW in the central part of Dajarra 1:100 000 Sheet area, Duchess 1:250 000 Sheet area.|
14590|One Tree Granite|Lithology|Consists mainly of grey, foliated, medium to fine-grained biotite-rich granite which commonly contains small feldspar phenocrysts, and massive to locally foliated commonly porphyritic coarser biotite granite; both are commonly xenolithic. Some microgranite, aplite, and pegmatite are also present.|
14590|One Tree Granite|Relationships and boundaries|The granite is inferred to intrude Plum Mountain Gneiss (new name) and may also intrude undivided Tewinga Group. It is intruded by mafic and porphyritic felsic dykes, and probably by Wills Creek Granite (new name), and is overlain by Leichhardt Volcanics and Cambarian sediments.|

24445|Oroopo Metabasalt|Unit history|Mapped as Eastern Creek Volcanics and Sybella Granite by Noakes & others (1959).|
24445|Oroopo Metabasalt|Type section locality|From GR 158792 to GR 124747, in the SW of the Ardmore 1:100 000 Sheet area. The section extends from about 2 km S of the track extending west from Rufus Tank in a SW direction to a major unnamed tributary of Quita Creek. A complete section from the base to the top of the formation has not been found. The type section consists mainly of amygdaloidal and massive metabasalt and interlayered lenses of meta-arenite and quartzite. It also contains some flow-margin breccia and scoriaceous metabasalt.|
24445|Oroopo Metabasalt|Extent|Exposed mainly in the SW of the Ardmore 1:100 000 Sheet area, and extends S into the Glenormiston 1:250 000 Sheet area. Some small outcrops in the central-north of the Ardmore Sheet area are also tentatively regarded as forming part of this unit.|
24445|Oroopo Metabasalt|Thickness range|Unknown; probably at least 1300 m. A complete section has not been found and there is a general absence of facing evidence and a lack of useful marker beds.|
24445|Oroopo Metabasalt|Lithology|The rocks are generally as in the type section. The formation also contains beds of recrystallised limestone, calcareous meta-arenite, ?dolomite, and metasiltstone.|
24445|Oroopo Metabasalt|Relationships and boundaries|The unit appears to concordantly overlie Saint Ronans Metamorphics; however, the contact is poorly exposed. It is cut by metadolerite dykes, and by rare veins of pegmatite and non-foliated to foliated, porphyritic to non-porphyritic biotite granite similar to the Sybella Granite elsewhere in the Ardmore Sheet area. The Oroopo Metabasalt is unconformably overlain by Cambrian sedimentary rocks of the Georgina Basin succession.|
24445|Oroopo Metabasalt|Age reasons|Precambrian, probably Proterozoic.|
24445|Oroopo Metabasalt|Proposed publication|Blake & others, in preparation|
24445|Oroopo Metabasalt|Comments|Remarks: The Oroopo Metabasalt is confined to within, and W of, the Rufus Fault Zone, which forms part of a major right-lateral fracture system extending to the SW and NNE (the Gorge Creek-Mount Remarkable Fault of Derrick & others, 1980). The Oroopo Metabasalt closely resembles the Eastern Creek Volcanics in the E part of the Ardmore 1:100 000 Sheet area. However, one of the noteworthy differences is the presence in the Eastern Creek Volcanics of abundant conglomerate and conglomeratic sediments containing clasts of felsic volcanics. Also, the Eastern Creek Volcanics apparently conformably overlie the Mount Guide Quartzite, a thick sequence of quartzose, feldspathic, and sericitic meta-arenite, whereas the Oroopo Metabasalt appears to be concordant on a sequence of mainly argillaceous metasediments and felsic and mafic metavolcanics (Saint Ronans Metamorphics). Such differences may be the result of facies variations from east to west, or they may indicate that the two formations are not equivalent.|

26091|Overhang Jaspilite|Geomorphic expression|The formation crops out as low, dark, strike ridges of jaspilite and calcareous metasediments, separated by valleys underlain by shale and siltstone. The formation has a soft, dark grey tone on black-and-white air photographs, and a distinctive dark blue-grey coloration on colour air photographs.|
26091|Overhang Jaspilite|Type section locality|Extending northeast for about 500 m from a point 17 km west southwest of Cloncurry, 4 km south of the Barkly Highway, latitude 20o45'20"S, longitude 140o21'5"E (6956 324049). The base of the section is 0.5 km north of a track joining Butcher Bore and the Malbon road. At the type locality the pale buff and greenish siltstone at the top of the Mitakoodi Quartzite grade into calcareous siltstone of the Overhang Jaspilite. Dips are from 45o to 50o to the northeast. The calcareous siltstone contains sporadic resistant laminae of ferruginous quartzite or chert, and is overlain by dark manganese-stained limestone with quaratzite laminae, tightly cross-folded jaspilite in laminated limestone, and dark green pyritic siltstone. In nearby outcrops this part of the sequence contains stromatolitic domes up to 2 m in diameter and one metre high. They are overlain by a recessive unit of greenish grey, laminated, slightly pyritic shale, which is overlain by another sequence of limestone and jaspilite. These sediments are overlain by varve-like shales with minor jaspilite beds and limestone, both of which become less common higher in the sequence. The top of the formation is not exposed in the type section due to folding, and elsewhere the top of the formation is generally obscured by minor faulting. However, the sections examined in detail are believed to be almost complete. A good reference section is located at Overhang Mine; in this section a thin quaratzite is exposed at the top of the section and is separated from the overlying Corella Formation by minor faulting. Barite veins are a characteristic feature of parts of the Overhang Jaspilite.|
26091|Overhang Jaspilite|Extent|The main exposures of the Overhang Jaspilite are in the Duck Creek and Bulonga Anticlines and in the Fox Mountain Dome (Fig. 3). It has been mapped in the Marraba and Mary Kathleen 1:100 000 1:100 000 Sheet areas and is known to occur in the Duchess and Malbon 1:100 000 Sheet areas. Jaspilitic rocks at the top of the Soldiers Cap Group on the Cloncurry 1:100 000 Sheet area may also belong to the Overhang Jaspilite.|
26091|Overhang Jaspilite|Thickness range|In the type section almost 200 metres of section is exposed; in the reference section about 500 metres of section is present but sections up to 850 m have been measured in other parts of the formation (Derrick et al., 1971).|
26091|Overhang Jaspilite|Relationships and boundaries|The Overhang Jaspilite conformably overlies the Mitakoodi Quartzite, except possibly in the south of the Bulonga Anticline, where the contact appears disconformable. The relationship of the Overhang Jaspilite with overlying units is uncertain as most boundaries are locally faulted or concealed. It appears to be conformably or disconformably overlain by the Corella Formation; the Chumvale Breccia contains jaspilitic fragments and appears to be derived from the Overhang Jaspilite by a process of brecciation, decalcification, and silicification.|

26091|Overhang Jaspilite|Comments|The relationships between the Overhang Jaspilite and the overlying Corella Formation has not been completely clarified by the detailed mapping. The evidence avalable at present favours a conformable relationship. However, regional considerations, such as the unconformities between the Mary Kathleen Group and Tewinga Group in the west of the basin, and between the Mary Kathleen Group and the Soldiers Cap Group (part of which is equivalent to the Malbon Group) in the east of the basin, and in unconformity of similar age in the western succession, indicate the possibility of an unconformity between the Overhang Jaspilite and the Corella Formation. Also, in several localities a thin conglomeratic quartzite is present at the base of the Corella Formation, overlying the Overhang Jaspilite. If further work substantiates this unconformity the Overhang Jaspilite will need to be redefined as part of the Malbon Group.|

24446|Overlander Granite|Name source|Named after the Overlander group of prospects and small mines in NE Duchess 1:100 000 Sheet area (Duchess 1:250 000 Sheet area).|
24446|Overlander Granite|Unit history|Mapped as Wonga Granite by Carter & Opik (1963).|
24446|Overlander Granite|Type section locality|From about GR 850745 to GR 859743, where the granite is very well exposed in the gorge cut by the Malbon River. Here the unit consists mainly of medium-grained foliated biotite leucogranite commonly showing well-developed joints. The granite contains scattered, sparse, small feldspar phenocrysts away from contacts with country rocks.|
24446|Overlander Granite|Extent|The granite forms several discrete elongate plutons in NE of the Duchess 1:100 000 Sheet area, the largest of which has an area of about 10 sq. km.|
24446|Overlander Granite|Lithology|The Overlander Granite is white, pink or grey, leucocratic, medium to coarse-grined, even-grained to slightly porphyritic, massive to foliated, and commonly partly recrystallised. The main mafic minerals are biotite and hornblende. Swarms of tourmaline-bearing, graphic, quartz-pink feldspar pegmatite dykes in the adjacent Corella Formation ar thought to be related to the Overlander Granite, because, although some pegmatite veins cut the plutons and were obviously intruded after the granite was emplaced, a few appear to be marginal facies of the granite and merge into it.|
24446|Overlander Granite|Relationships and boundaries|The Overlander Granite intrudes the Corella Formation and some amphibolitic metadolerite bodies. It is cut by an apparently unmetamorphosed dolerite dyke.|

24447|Oweenee Rhyolite|Name source|The name is derived from Mount Oweenee, at GR 8059-452604.|
24447|Oweenee Rhyolite|Unit history|Originally defined as the Oweenee Granite by White (1959) and referred to as such by Wyatt & others (1970).|
24447|Oweenee Rhyolite|Geomorphic expression|The Oweenee Rhyolite is clearly identifiable on aerial photographs, forming higher, more rugged hills compared to the lower hills of the Malmesbury Microgranite and Silurian-Devonian sedimentary rocks of the Broken River Province.|
24447|Oweenee Rhyolite|Type section locality|The type area for the Oweenee Granite by White (1959) was a 'good section along the telegraph line, 14 miles (23 km) south of Blue Range Station in Stenhouse Gap'. White's type area stands as the type area for the Oweenee Rhyolite. However, because the section in Stenhouse Gap is roughly parallel to strike and is topographically low, it probably does not contain a significant vertical section through the unit. Therefore several reference sections are also designated. Reference section: The base of the Oweenee Rhyolite is well exposed at GR 7959-380545 in a gully on the western slopes of Mount Mackay, and the section from there to the summit of Mount Mackay at 7959-389542 is designated a reference section. At the base, 5 m of buff to pale grey, moderately crystal-rich rhyolitic ignimbrite, overlies purple, medium to very coarse-grained, thick-bedded lithic sandstone (probably volcaniclastic) of the Lyall Formation. The sandstone dips east at about 20o. The remainder of the section (approximately 600 m) consists of dark grey to pink, generally crystal-rich rhyolitic ignimbrite. Another reference section is along the Kidston power line at 8059-449650 where the basal parat of the unit is exposed. At the base, 5 to 10 m of pink to green crystal-rich rhyolitic ignimbrite containing common flamme up to 10 cm long is inferred to unconformably overlie the Greenvale Formation, although the actual contact does not crop out. This unit is overlain by 5 to 10 m of buff, moderately crystal-rich ignimbrite with smaller fiamme. The uppermost unit is dark grey, moderately crystal-rich to crystal-rich ignimbrite with smaller fiamme, although a eutaxitic foliation is etched out on weathered surfaces. The total thickness of this upper unit has not been determined. Gowrie Creek from GR 8059-438589 to 8059-425612 is the third proposed reference section. In this section, coarse, recrystallised, crystal-rich, biotite rhyolitic ignimbrite are exposed. Variations include the presence of clasts of sedimentary rocks and/or intrusive rocks. Dykes of porphyritic microgranite intrude the ignimbrite.|
24447|Oweenee Rhyolite|Extent|The Oweenee Rhyolite covers approximately 260 km2 and is restricted to the area south of the Sybil Graben, from near Spring Park homestead in the south, to at least as far north as the Gregory Developmental Road.|
24447|Oweenee Rhyolite|Thickness range|The thickness is difficult to determine because of the lack of dip information. At least 600 m is exposed in the section at Mount Mackay where the sequence dips 20o east. Assuming a constant easterly dip of 20o, the thickness exposed between the western contact and the topographic high on the east side of Stenhouse Gap, is 1000 m. The total thickness must therefore, be considerably greater.|
24447|Oweenee Rhyolite|Lithology|Crystal-rich rhyolitic ignimbrite, commonly recrystallised.|
24447|Oweenee Rhyolite|Relationships and boundaries|The Oweenee Rhyolite is intruded by, but is probably co-magmatic with the Malmesbury Microgranite. This is postulated largely on the basis of their close spatial association rather than geochemical or petrographic evidence. After eruption, the Oweenee Rhyolite was intruded by the remaining magma (i.e. the Malmesbury Microgranite) possibly by a stoping mechanism in which blocks of the overlying ignimbrite fell into the underlying magma. The relationships between the Malmesbury Microgranite and the Oweenee Rhyolite can be seen in the Silver Spray mine area where ignimbrite is intruded by porphyritic microgranite dykes. Similar relationships occur 4 km southeast of Mount George, where dykes of porphyritic microgranite cut the ignimbrite, adjacent to the contact with the Malmesbury Microgranite. Along its northwestern margin the Oweenee Rhyolite unconformably overlies the Silurian Greenvale Formation of the Broken River Province. In Sandy Creek and gullies west of Spring Park Homestead and north to near Mount Mackay the ignimbrite overlies (apparently conformably) sedimentary and volcanic rocks of the Lyall Formation of the Clarke River Group (Scott and Withnall, 1987). The Meath Rhyolite Member, a significant unit in the middle of the Lyall Formation could be a distal equivalent of the Oweenee Rhyolite. It consists of approximately 40 m of biotite bearing, moderately crystal-rich ignimbrite and some sandstone. However, alternative sources for the Meath Rhyolite Member may be some of the rhyolitic plugs within the Clarke Rivr Basin. If so, some of the airfall tuffs in the sequence may be distal equivalents of the Oweenee Rhyolite.|
24447|Oweenee Rhyolite|Identifying features|The Oweenee Granite was defined by White (1959). He described it as "coarse, pink, porphyritic granite to microgranite, frequently containing zoned feldspars and xenoliths of quartz-biotite hornfels. Grades marginally into a grey, flow banded rhyolite". It was described in more detail by Wyatt & others (1970) who extended the name to include granite which forms the Coane Range to the northeast of the Sybil Graben. Mapping by the Mines Department Officers during the 1986 field season, mainly to the south of the Sybil Graben, has led to a redefinition of the Oweenee Granite as defined by White (1959). Three main lithologies were delineated. These are: (1) crystal-rich rhyolitic ignimbrites; (2) porphyritic microgranite; and (3) an equigranular to rarely porphyritic, coarse biotite granite. Remapping of the type area of White (1959) has shown it to be rhyolitic ignimbrite. Branch (1966) recognised that the Oweenee Granite included some ignimbrite, at least along its western margin, but did not know its full extent. The ignimbrite is now known to be extensive and also includes Mount Oweenee, the feature after which the Oweenee Granite was named. It is therefore proposed that the rhyolitic ignimbrite be named the Oweenee Rhyolite, and that the porphyritic microgranite, which makes up the remainder of the area of White's "Oweenee Granite" to the southeast of the Sybil Graben be named the Malmesbury Microgranite. The equigranular to rarely porphyritic biotite granite, and other granitoids north of the Sybil Graben, all of which were included in Oweenee Granite by Wyatt & others (1970), will not be renamed until further work has been done.|
24447|Oweenee Rhyolite|Structure and Metamorphism|South of the Daintree mine eutaxitic layering, destroyed in most other places by recrystallisation, indicates a local dip of 8o southwest. Along the Kidston power line dips of 15o south-southeast are indicated by large fiamme. In the Mount Mackay area, a basal ignimbrite rests apparently conformably on sandstone of the Lyall Formation which dips 20o east. A similar relationship occurs in the Spring Park area, where the sedimentary rocks dip 15o southeast. The Oweenee Rhyolite is strongly jointed, most common orientations being northwest and northeast.|
24447|Oweenee Rhyolite|Age reasons|The age of the Oweenee Rhyolite is not known exactly. However, as suggested above, the Oweenee Rhyolite may be co-magmatic with the Malmesbury Microgranite. Webb (1969) suggested a Middle Carboniferous age (342+/-7 Ma) for the granite on the basis of a Rb/Sr isochron. This age would be consistent with the correlation of the Oweenee Rhyolite with the Meath Rhyolite Member and/or other tuffs in the Lyall Formation. The Lyall Formation is a volcaniclastic unit and is largely Visean in age (Scott, 1985; Playford and Jell, 1985).|

25377|Pall Mall Granite|Unit history|The original name for this unit, the "Pall Mall Adamellite", was first published by Wyatt & Jell (1967) but was not formally defined. The unit was also described by Wyatt & others (1970). The name has been changed to Pall Mall Granite to conform with IUGS recommendations (Le Maitre, 1989).|
25377|Pall Mall Granite|Geomorphic expression|The granite is well exposed and forms large boulders and tors. Residual sand and gravel, as well as minor Tertiary basalt cover a small part of the pluton.|
25377|Pall Mall Granite|Type section locality|The type locality is beside the Hervey Range Road at 8159-128438 just east of the Dotswood Homestead turnoff.  The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.|
25377|Pall Mall Granite|Description at type locality|Boulders and a few low tors of mottled cream and pink, medium to coarse-grained, moderately porphyritic biotite granite occur at this locality.|
25377|Pall Mall Granite|Extent|The Pall Mall Granite is an oval-shaped pluton in the southern part of ROLLINGSTONE extending into the northern part of DOTSWOOD. It is roughly 16km long, 10km wide and covers an area of approximately 155km2. It lies 4 to 10km west of Keelbottom Creek and is dissected by Brinagee (Brummagy) Creek.|
25377|Pall Mall Granite|Lithology|The Pall Mall Granite is a mottled cream and pink, medium to coarse grained, moderately to abundantly porphyritic biotite granite. The Pall Mall Granite has sparse, dark grey, fine-grained, rounded, dioritic xenoliths up to 15cm long.|
25377|Pall Mall Granite|Relationships and boundaries|The Pall Mall Granite intrudes the Proterozoic(?) Argentine Metamorphics, sedimentary rocks of the Late Devonian Dotswood Group, and the Ravenswood Granodiorite Complex. A small portion of the pluton is overlain by Tertiary-Quaternary sediments and Tertiary basalt.|
25377|Pall Mall Granite|Age reasons|Webb (1969) determined a K-Ar biotite age of 289 Ma for the Pall Mall Granite, close to the Carboniferous - Permian boundary.|

23891|Paluma Rhyolite|Name source|The unit is named after the Paluma Range and also the township of Paluma.|
23891|Paluma Rhyolite|Unit history|Wyatt & others (1970) previously termed these rocks the "Unnamed Dark Grey Volcanics" (Cuy). Our mapping has not greatly altered the unit's boundaries in the northern part of ROLLINGSTONE, but rocks in the southeast portion of the sheet that were previously mapped as Cuy are not included in the Paluma Rhyolite.|
23891|Paluma Rhyolite|Type section locality|A road cutting on the Paluma Ewan Road (8159 107969) about 6km west of Paluma township provides good exposure.  The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.|
23891|Paluma Rhyolite|Description at type locality|Dark grey, very crystal-rich rhyolitic ignimbrite.|
23891|Paluma Rhyolite|Thickness range|The thickness of the Paluma Rhyolite cannot be accurately measured. Orientation of fiamme indicate that the unit is relatively flat lying. It crops out from near sea level to the top of the Paluma Range, suggesting that the unit is up to 900m thick.|
23891|Paluma Rhyolite|Lithology|The Paluma Rhyolite is predominantly a dark grey, crystal-rich to very crystal-rich rhyolitic ignimbrite. Crystal content is generally over 50% consisting of quartz (25-30%), K-feldspar (15 20%), plagioclase (10-15%) and mafic minerals (<5%). The ignimbrite contains sparse fiamme (<5%) up to 2cm long and rare andesitic or dacitic lithic clasts up to 1.5cm.|
23891|Paluma Rhyolite|Relationships and boundaries|Spatial relationship and dips measured in the Blue Gum Creek area suggest that the Paluma Rhyolite unconformably overlies the Saint Giles Volcanics. To the west it is intruded by the Coane Range Granite Complex and to the east it has been intruded by the Clemant Microgranite. Geochemical data suggest the Paluma Rhyolite is co-magmatic with the Clemant Microgranite (Gunther & Withnall, 1992) and is part of a suite that includes most of the Early Carboniferous granites in the region. M. Fanning (Appendix 1) obtained a U-Pb zircon (SHRIMP) age of 337±6 Ma for the Clemant Microgranite|
23891|Paluma Rhyolite|Age reasons|Based on relationships detailed above, the Paluma Rhyolite is therefore inferred to be Early Carboniferous.|

14851|Papilio Mudstone|Extent|A narrow southwest-trending belt from near Jessey Springs at about 7859-675517 to the Broken River.  South of the Broken River, it is intricately folded with other units of the Broken River Group from the headwaters of Dosey Creek to about 2 km west of Spanner Hill.|
14851|Papilio Mudstone|Thickness range|200m at type section.|
14851|Papilio Mudstone|Lithology|.  Calcareous mudstone and generally minor fine-grained calcareous sandstone and nodular limestone.  The proportion of sandstone increases to the southwest.  A thick unit of limestone southwest from Pages Creek to Spanner Hill is assigned to the Spanner Limestone Member.  Limestone is also well developed south of the Broken River between 7859-580436 and 591449, and is also assigned to this member.|
14851|Papilio Mudstone|Fossils|The unit contains common to locally abundant brachiopods, solitary rugose and tabulate corals, stromatoporoids, bivalves, gastropods, crinoids, conodonts, and plant fragments.|
14851|Papilio Mudstone|Relationships and boundaries|The Papilio Mudstone is the uppermost formation in the Wando Vale Subgroup of the Broken River Group.  South of the Broken River it conformably overlies the Dosey Limestone, whereas to the north, between the river and Jessey Springs it conformably overlies the Burges Formation.  Thin mudstone intervals overlying the Lockup Well and Dip Creek Limestones are also equated with the Papilio Mudstone, but are mostly too thin to map out.  The unit contains the Spanner Limestone Member between Pages Creek and Spanner Hill.  The Papilio Mudstone is conformably overlain by the Mytton Formation.|

14857|Paradise Creek Formation|Name source|Paradise Creek which joins Gunpowder Creek at 6758-210135.|
14857|Paradise Creek Formation|Unit history|The rocks now included in the redefined Paradise Creek Formation were previously part of the Paradise Creek Formation of de Keyser (1958). In the Lawn Hill and northern part of the Camooweal 4-mile Geological Sheets they were included in the Ploughed Mountain Beds by Carter & others (1961). Cavaney (1975) proposed to name these rocks "Paradise Formation".|
14857|Paradise Creek Formation|Type section locality|Holostratotype: Along Paradise Creek from 195146 (base) to 137170 (top) in the Mammoth Mines 1:100 000 Sheet area.The base of the holostratotype is about 1.5 km along Paradise Creek from its junction with Gunpowder Creek. The Paradise Creek Formation in the type section has been subdivided into four subunits, the lowermost of which is defined as the Mount Oxide Chert Member; the other three subunits remain informal. The four subunits are, from top to bottom: Subunit 4: Approximately 350 m of dolomite, stromatolitic dolomite and intraclast dolomite containing "cauliflower chert" structures (replacements after anhydrite) and minor chert nodules.  Subunit 3: Middle stromatolite marker (informal); stromatolitic chert and sandstone.  Subunit 2: Approximately 1000 m of interbedded dolomite and siltstone, stromatolitic dolomite, intraclast dolomite, chert and minor sandstone.  Subunit 1: Mount Oxide Chert Member: Two metre thick bed of laminated to thinly bedded chert. It forms the base of the Paradise Creek Formation.|
14857|Paradise Creek Formation|Extent|The unit crops out extensively in the eastern parts of the Lawn Hill and Riversleigh 1:100 000 Sheet areas. It is best exposed along the western margin of the Mount Oxide 1:100 000 Sheet area, and also crops out extensively in the Mammoth Mines, Kennedy Gap and Yelvertoft 1:100 000 Sheet areas.|
14857|Paradise Creek Formation|Thickness range|The maximum thickness recorded is 850 m in the type section. In the Lawn Hill 1:100 000 Sheet area, the thickness is 500 m. It is thickest in the western part of the Mammoth Mines 1:100 000 Sheet area where it is 1400 m thick.|
14857|Paradise Creek Formation|Lithology|The lithology of the Unit throughout the region differs little from the type section. The Mount Oxide Chert Member is present everywhere except in the northernmost outcrops. The middle stromatolite marker is not always present and may be a facies equivalent of the massive quartz sandstone which occurs at about this stratigraphic level in the Kennedy Gap, Mount Oxide and western part of the Mammoth Mines Sheet areas.|
14857|Paradise Creek Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The Paradise Creek Formation conformably overlies the Gunpowder Creek Formation. This boundary is placed at the base of the Mount Oxide Chert Member which occurs in most basal sequences and is easily recognised as it forms a low but persistent ridge. The Paradise Creek Formation is conformably overlain by the Esperanza Formation. This boundary is placed at the base of the lowermost of a series of massive stromatolitic cherts.|

24451|Parrot Camp Rhyolite|Name source|Parrot Camp dam; GR 7361-425027.|
24451|Parrot Camp Rhyolite|Unit history|The rhyolite is a previously undifferentiated part of the Croydon Volcanics (Branch, 1966). Mackenzie (1983) informally named and described the 'Parrot Camp rhyolite'.|
24451|Parrot Camp Rhyolite|Geomorphic expression|The unit occurs in areas of moderate to gentle relief with relatively sparse tree cover compared to surrounding units. Bouldery outcrops are common.|
24451|Parrot Camp Rhyolite|Type section locality|The type section extends from GR 7361-412065 (base) south to -416048, thence southwest to -404025. It is made up of about 300 m of dark grey to greenish-grey, medium-coarse-grained, moderately crystal-rich rhyolitic ignimbrite overlain by about 10 m of very dark-grey, medium to fine-grained, crystal-rich dacitic ignimbrite. The base of the section is a conformable (?) contact with very dark grey, medium to coarse-grained, crystal-poor, intensely recrystallised rhyodacitic ignimbrite (B Creek Rhyolite), and the top of the section is an abarupt, concordant, possibly paraconformable transition into massive, medium to dark-grey, fine-grained, crystal-poor rhyolitic ignimbrite (Carron Rhyolite).|
24451|Parrot Camp Rhyolite|Extent|The unit crops out in a belt extending from west and northwest of Parrot Camp dam to about 3 km east of the Near Carron River, and also to the south and southwest of the dam around the head of Dead Horse Creek. Similar rocks, which occupy the same stratigaraphic position and are therefore correlated with the unit, occur in a small area near Golden Gate Creek, 8 km northwest of Croydon.|
24451|Parrot Camp Rhyolite|Thickness range|The thickness ranges up topossibly 200 or 300 m, but is difficult to estimate because of the generally massive nature of the formation. The topographic relief in the type area indicates a minimum thickness there of about 60 m. The unit lenses out completely to the east of the Near Carron River.|
24451|Parrot Camp Rhyolite|Lithology|The rock is a dark-grey to green-grey, coarse, moderately crystal-rich rhyolitic ignimbrite with abundant crystals (up to 4 mm) of quartz, pale greenish altered plagioclase, and white K-feldspar; pellets (up to 1 cm across) of graphite are common. The rock is commonly massive, but in some places has an irregular eutaxitic structure consisting of alternating lenses of paler and darker rock (e.g. outcrop at GR 420039, 1.3 km northwest of Parrot Camp Dam). The rock is very similar in appearance, mineralogy and composition to another unit in the Croydon Volcanic Group, the Idalia Rhyolite.|
24451|Parrot Camp Rhyolite|Relationships and boundaries|The unit is interpreted as overlying the B Creek Rhyolite from its geographical distribution between this rhyolite and the overlying Carron Rhyolite. The relationship with the Carron Rhyolite is indicated to the south and southwest of Parrot Camp Dam, where the Carron Rhyolite forms ridges and in some places cliffs above the Parrot Camp Rhyolite in the valleys below, and where the contacts tend to follow contours levels.|
24451|Parrot Camp Rhyolite|Age reasons|The age is Middle Proterozoic as for the rest of the Croydon Volcanic Group.|

23894|Peak Vale Granodiorite|Geomorphic expression|Relief is low compared with the surrounding metamorphic rocks, and the area is gently undulating. Outcrop is good in Theresa Creek, forming platforms up to tens of metres across, but is poor elsewhere because of a thick weathering profile and extensive deposits of alluvial gravels, especially in the north.  The Peak Vale Granodiorite is delineated on the Landsat 5 TM (1-4-7 BGR) image by cleared areas that have a yellowish hue. The unit exhibits complex magnetic anomalies with strongest responses along the northern and southern margins, and very low anomalies in the central portion. K, Th and U responses are strongest in the south and central area of outcrop, but are generally low elsewhere.|
23894|Peak Vale Granodiorite|Type section locality|At 8351-326347, 3 km west of Peak Vale Homestead.  The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.|18/MAR/08
23894|Peak Vale Granodiorite|Description at type locality|Two rock types, representative of the unit, are exposed; a biotite-hornblende granodiorite and biotite-hornblende quartz diorite or monzodiorite.|
23894|Peak Vale Granodiorite|Extent|An east-west trending oval pluton, 8 km by 5 km, on the central-west margin of the Retreat Batholith.|
23894|Peak Vale Granodiorite|Lithology|Two main rock-types make up the Peak Vale Granodiorite - grey, fine to coarse-grained, subequigranular to porphyritic pyroxene-biotite-hornblende granodiorite, and subordinate quartz monzodiorite of similar texture and composition. The quartz monzodiorite is found only in the southern half of the pluton.|
23894|Peak Vale Granodiorite|Relationships and boundaries|Largely surrounded by and intrudes the Anakie Metamorphic Group. To the east, it probably intrudes the Kilmarnock Granodiorite.|
23894|Peak Vale Granodiorite|Age reasons|Ages of 369 Ma and 376 Ma were obtained from Rb-Sr dating of biotite-whole rock pairs from the granodiorite and quartz monzodiorite respectively. The age is therefore Middle Devonian and similar to ages from the Kilmarnock Granodiorite.|
15032|Pemberton Grange Basalt|Name source|The name is derived from the locality of Pemberton Grange approximately 10 km east of Bundaberg on the Bundaberg-Elliott Heads road. Pemberton Grange is located at GR 442488 Bundaberg 1:100 000 Sheet area (latitude 24o52'26"S, longitude 152o26'46"E, Bundaberg 1:250 000 Sheet SG 56-2). The basalt cropping out at the surface at Pemberton Grange is Hummock Basalt but it is in this area that the maximum thickness of subsurface basaltic lava has been intersected in water bores in the Bundaberg Trough.|
15032|Pemberton Grange Basalt|Type section locality|The type section of the Pemberton Grange Basalt is taken as the 45 m of cored volcanics extending from 69 m to 114 m in Fairymead NS1 drillhole drilled 4.2 km north of Fairymead Sugar Mill at GR 353619 Bundaberg 1:100 000 Sheet area. The top is defined by red clay, the decomposition product vesicular basalt. The base is defined by weathered vesicular basalt. The material designated as the type section is stored at the Queensland Mines Department core storage library at Redbank under the designation Fairymead NS1. The hole was drilled by the Drilling Branch of the Mines Department at the request of the Geological Survey of Queensland.|
15032|Pemberton Grange Basalt|Extent|The unit is not exposed at the surface. It is known to occur over a distance of more than 40 km extending from Moore Park to south of the Elliott River in the Bundaberg Trough, and that its subsurface extent on land probably exceeds 80 km2.|
15032|Pemberton Grange Basalt|Thickness range|The maximum thickness intersected is 45 m in Fairymead NS1.|
15032|Pemberton Grange Basalt|Lithology|Microporphyritic olivine basalt occurring as both the massive and vesicular varieties and varying in colour from black to grey black when unweathered. The upper part of the unit has been altered to a red clay to a depth of approximately 4.6 m. In thin section, olivine (10 percent) occurs as altered euhedral to subhedral microphenocrysts of up to 2 mm diameter set in a fine-grained groundmass of labradorite feldspar (50 percent), augite (15 percent), glass (20 percent) and opaques (5 percent).The euhedral to subhedral labaradorite laths average 0.3 mm in length, but may attain a length up to 1.2 mm while the subophitic grains of augite rarely exceed 0.5 mm in diameter partly enclosing as well as interstitial to plagioclase.|
15032|Pemberton Grange Basalt|Relationships and boundaries|Basalt unconformably overlies the Cretaceous Burrum Coal Measures and is unconformably overlain by late Early Eocene sediments (informally named Fairymead beds). The base of the unit is taken as the change from sediments of the Burrum Coal Measures to volcanic material. The upper boundary is fixed by the change from basalt or its weathering products to sediments.|
15032|Pemberton Grange Basalt|Identifying features|Geophysical characteristics: No geophysical investigations have been conducted on the unit.|
15032|Pemberton Grange Basalt|Age reasons|The basalt unconformably overlies the Burrum Coal Measures of late Aptian to Albian age (Ellis & Whitaker, 1976) and is nonconformably overlain by late Early Eocene sediments. Based on stratigraphic and tectonic evidence for the formation of the Bundaberg Trough, the age of the Pemberton Grange Basalt is tentatively given as Paleocene to Early Eocene. Isotopic data are not available.|

15163|Pickwick Metabasalt Member|Name source|Pickwick' pastoral blocks of the Whitworth holding 56 km north of Mount Isa situated between 20o2'S latitude and 20o23'S latitude and between 139o27'E longitude and the Leichhardt River. The name "Pickwick Beds" was introduced as an informal name by Robinson (1968); since this unit is generally well exposed, and its relationships to other units is readily determined, it is proposed that the unit become a formal member.|
15163|Pickwick Metabasalt Member|Type section locality|No type section was nominated by Robinson (1968) but an area 48 km north-northeast of Mount Isa, between Paroo and Conglomerate Creek would be suitable. It is 19 km south-southwest of Julius dam, and is traversed by the Mt Isa-Julius dam pipeline road; GR 581565 in the Prospector 1:100 000 Sheet area, latitude 20o27'20"S, longitude 139o38'E to latitude 20o16'45"S, longitude 139o38'45"E. The type section contains 750 m of massive and amygdaloidal breccia, basalt, and white to dark grey quartzite. At least three quartzite interbeds are present - a 10 m to 60 m thick white quartzite, a 3 m and a 5 m thick dark grey quartzite, 130 m, 315 m and 600 m from the base of the member, respectively. Other complete sections of the Pickwick Metabasalt Member occur 10 to 15 km northeast of Mount Isa.|

22657|Pinchgut Granite|Name source|The unit was named by Richards (1981) after Pinchgut Pinnacle, a prominent knoll of granite about 12.5 km east-northeast of Chillagoe.|
22657|Pinchgut Granite|Unit history|Formerly mapped as part of the Almaden Granite (Best, 1962;  de Keyser & Wolff, 1964;  de Keyser & Lucas, 1968).|
22657|Pinchgut Granite|Extent|:  The granite forms a roughly ovoid, northeasterly trending pluton of 2 km2 east of Pinchgut Creek.  The small pod of granite 1.5 km to the south is tentatively mapped as Pinchgut Granite.|07/MAY/08
22657|Pinchgut Granite|General description|STRUCTURE AND METAMORPHISM:: The Pinchgut Granite is cut by several faults and by numerous joints and small-scale fractures.  Mouthier & Schumacher (1981) reported that the northern pluton is cut by an easterly trending mylonite zone, about 4 m wide.MINERALISATION::  Minor uranium mineralisation has been reported from several places in the northern pluton (Mouthier & Schumacher, 1981).  According to Mouthier & Schumacher (1981) the anomalous zone is 1.5 km long and 1 km wide and the main areas of mineralisation are located along an easterly trending mylonite zone.  The principal uranium mineral identified is novacekite, a yellow hydrated magnesium uranyl arsenate [Mg(UO2)2 (AsO4)2.9H2O].  A green radioactive mineral (torbenite?) is also present in places.  The uranium minerals are generally associated with pyrite and psilomelane, and occur mainly along joints and fractures in the granite.  In 1981, AFMECO Pty Ltd drilled 36 shallow (3 m) percussion holes in the two main radiometric anomalies.  The drilling indicated that yellow and pale green secondary uranium-bearing minerals persisted in the granite to depths of at least 3 m.|
22657|Pinchgut Granite|Lithology|(after Richards, 1981;  Mouthier & Schumacher, 1981):  The unit consists mainly of coarse-grained biotite leucogranite characterised by a relatively high K feldspar content.Quartz forms large irregular, locally composite grains up to 8 mm across.  K-feldspar is orthoclase microperthite or microcline microperthite and forms simply twinned grains up to 10 mm long.  Granophyric intergrowths are reportedly present in parts of the pluton.  Plagioclases are mainly subhedral laths, up to 8 mm long, with sericitised cores of andesine (~An42) mantled mainly by normally zoned oligoclase (~An20-An14).  Oscillatory zoning is rare and, where present, weakly developed.  Some plagioclase grains lack andesine cores.  Plagioclases in contact with K-feldspar commonly have an outer rim of albite either in optical continuity with the enclosed plagioclase grains or as aggregates of small (0.5 to 1 mm across) grains.  Albite is also reported to form coarse perthitic lamellae, and is commonly associated with quartz in myrmekitic intergrowths.Biotite, pleochroic from straw yellow to brown, forms subhedral grains up to 4 mm long.The main accessory minerals are apatite, zircon, and magnetite containing ilmenite lamellae.The Pinchgut Granite has undergone some hydrothermal alteration.  Feldspars are commonly clouded and calcic plagioclase cores and biotite grains are commonly partly replaced by sericite and chlorite, respectively.  Less common secondary minerals reported are muscovite, calcite, fluorite, and iron oxides (commonly forming aggregates of small grains).Enclaves are small (average diameter about 1.5 cm) and rare, and consist of granular aggregates of anhedral plagioclase, quartz and biotite grains in about the same abundance, and subordinate K feldspar.  Accessory minerals are scarce.|
22657|Pinchgut Granite|Relationships and boundaries|The granite intrudes the Ruddygore Granodiorite.  The pluton tentatively assigned to this formation south of Pinchgut Pinnacle may also intrude the Featherbed Volcanics.|
22657|Pinchgut Granite|Age reasons|The granite is most probably Late Carboniferous.  It has not been isotopically dated.|
22657|Pinchgut Granite|Comments|The Pinchgut Granite is a member of the Ootann Supersuite.  The common occurrence of exsolved albite in the K-feldspar grains, the presence of granophyric intergrowths and the narrow contact metamorphic aureole indicate that the Pinchgut Granite was emplaced at relatively high crustal levels, possibly to within 6 to 3 km of the surface (Richards, 1981).  It is a subvolcanic granite using the classification of White & others (1964).|

A central, irregularly shaped ring-like intrusion has its northern, eastern, southern and western extremities at GR 7561-395759, -460705, 415687 and 0337777. There are small "outliers" at -366757 and -337765, and dykes at -441752and -4507055. An outer arcuate dyke crops out through Quaternary cover in the Riverview area (GR 7561-307770) and thence south and southeast to -320633, where it narrows and becomes finer-grained (rhyolitic), and thence east to -351617 where it splays into a number of small rhyolite dykes. A small but prominent "outlier" on the northern side of the Gilbert River, opposite Riverview has also been mapped as part of this dyke.|
27682|Prestwood Microgranite|Lithology|Pink or grey generally strongly porphyritic biotite microgranite, with large phenocrysts of quartz, orthoclase or sanidine, sodic plagioclase and small phenocrysts of chloritized biotite in a fine-grained mosaic of quartz, alkali feldspar, plagioclase, and other (minor) phases. The feldspars are generally partly to heavily sericitised.|
27682|Prestwood Microgranite|Relationships and boundaries|Intrudes Robertson River, Townley, and Heliman Formations, Forsayth Granite, and Aurora Granite and probably Mount Darcy Microgranodiorite. Does not appear to have undergone significant metamorphism or structural disturbance. |
27682|Prestwood Microgranite|Identifying features|Original definition: The term "Prestwood Microgranite" was first used by White (1959), who gave as its type locality an area "one mile [1.6 km] northeast of Prestwood Homestead on the northern side of the Georgetown-Croydon highway".  The problem: We have inspected and sampled a location 800 m north of the highway and 500 m east of Crooked Creek (GR 7561-364783) corresponding to White's (1959) type area, and found there a grey porphyritic microgranodiorite containing phenocrysts of quartz, plagioclase, hornblende, and biotite. White's description of the lithology of the Prestwood Microgranite is "light grey porphyritic microgranite with phenocrysts of quartz, orthoclase and biotite". His distribution corresponds with ours, but includes the Mount Sircom Microgranodiorite. Branch (1966) described the Prestwood Microgranite as a pink porphyritic biotite adamellite, stressing that biotite was the sole ferromagnesian mineral, and mentioned a locality 5 km southeast of Prestwood Homestead. We have confirmed that the porphyritic intrusive rocks south and southeast of Prestwood homestead are biotite microgranite (or "microadamellite", an obsolete term), but many other porphyritic intrusive bodies assigned by White (1959) and Branch (1966) to the Prestwood Microgranite belong to other units (Mount Darcy Microgranodiorite or Mount Sircom Microgranodiorite.|
27682|Prestwood Microgranite|Age reasons|Probably Carboniferous; probably a late-stage intrusive related to the Cumberland Range Volcanics (Branch, 1966) which are closely similar to the mid-Carboniferous Newcastle Range Volcanics (Black, 1973).|
27682|Prestwood Microgranite|Comments|Both original authors of the name "Prestwood Microgranite", D A White and C D Branch, have been contacted and have agreed to our proposal that the type area be changed.|

24464|Puppy Camp Granodiorite|Unit history|Previously mapped as Forsayth Granite (White, 1962).|
24464|Puppy Camp Granodiorite|Type section locality|In Telegraph Creek and its tributaries from the railway bridge at GR 980693 downstream to GR 964700 (Mount Surprise 1:100 000 Sheet area), where whitish-grey medium-grained equigranular to slightly porphyritic biotite granodiorite crops out.|
24464|Puppy Camp Granodiorite|Extent|The Puppy Camp Granodiorite crops out in the southwestern part of the Mount Surprise 1:100 000 Sheet area as an oblong-shaped pluton with a northeasterly trending axis. It is exposed over an area of about 150 km2.|
24464|Puppy Camp Granodiorite|Lithology|Whitish-grey, massive medium-grained, equigranular to slightly porphyritic muscovite-biotite and biotite granodiorite with sparse white K-feldspar megacrysts which are generally 2 to 4 cm long and rarely up to 8 cm. Biotite 'clots', generally 1 to 3 cm long, are present locally. Pinkish-white muscovite leucogranite veins are common throughout the granodiorite. Muscovite-biotite granodiorite crops out mainly in the southwestern half of the batholith.|
24464|Puppy Camp Granodiorite|Relationships and boundaries|The unit intrudes the Proterozoic Einasleigh Metamorphics and small unassigned leucogranite bodies. It is overlain by the Carboniferous Newcastle Range Volcanics and locally intruded by large Palaeozoic microgranite dykes. It is overlain by Cainozoic basalt.|
24464|Puppy Camp Granodiorite|Age reasons|Probably Silurian to Devonian; the unit has a massive unfoliated character and is petrographically similar to the White Springs Granodiorite (Withnall & others, 1976), which is now known to be of Siluro-Devonian age (Black & Holmes, in preparation).|

25420|Purkin Granite|Name source|Parish of Purkin, County of Percy.|
25420|Purkin Granite|Unit history|White (1962) mapped the rocks as unassigned late Palaeozoic granite. Branch (1966 p.99) equated them with the Elizabeth Creek Granite which they resemble. Smart (1973) used the name Purkin Igneous Complex for the outer part of the stock, the core being interpreted as Dumbano Ganite. He did not define the unit, however. Our mapping has shown the "complex" to be relatively uniform and that the stock and batholith are not significantly different in character. Therefore the name is changed to Purkin Granite and applied to the rocks of both the batholith and stock.|
25420|Purkin Granite|Type section locality|Between GR 137481 and 138451 in Goat Gorge, formed where the Gilbert River cuts through the granite in the batholith. Grey to pink, medium grained, equigranular biotite granite, and some porphyritic and coarse grained varieties locally cut by aplite veins, crop out in the gorge.|
25420|Purkin Granite|Extent|Crops out in a batholith and a large stock along the northern edge of the Gilberton Plateau. The batholith is irregular in outline and has an area of 300 km2. The stock, which is roughly circular in Outline, 10 to 12 km in diameter and about 100 km2 in area, occurs to the west of the batholith, south of the old Gorge Creek Outstation, and centred at about GR 890 420 (Gilberton 1:100 000 Sheet area).|
25420|Purkin Granite|Lithology|As for the type area; porphyritic varieties are mainly restricted to the batholith where some grey to dark grey and very coarse grained varieties are also present.|
25420|Purkin Granite|Relationships and boundaries|Intrudes the Proterozoic Einasleigh Metamorphics and various leucogranite phases associated with them. Partly overlain by Mesozoic sediments of the Eulo Queen Group and Gilbert River Formation.|
25420|Purkin Granite|Age reasons|Carboniferous; Richards & others (1966) obtained a K-Ar biotite age of 350 m.y. on a sample of the granite.|

29321|Quaker Granite|Name source|The unit is named after Quaker Creek which drains the northern part of the adamellite.|
29321|Quaker Granite|Unit history|Previously mapped as Elizabeth Creek Granite (Best, 1962;  de Keyser & Wolff, 1964).|
29321|Quaker Granite|Type section locality|The proposed type locality is at GR 2407 80916 on the eastern side of Quaker Creek.  The locality is ~11 km south-southeast of Chillagoe and on the southern side of a station track extending west from Quaker Bore.|
29321|Quaker Granite|Description at type locality|The adamellite forms undulating and dissected hilly country with numerous scattered boulders, bouldery outcrops and rock pavements.  It is characterised by medium tones on aerial photographs.|
29321|Quaker Granite|Extent|The Quaker Granite forms an ovoid, northerly trending pluton of ~40 km2, about 15 km south-southeast of Chillagoe.|
29321|Quaker Granite|General description|STRUCTURE AND METAMORPHISM:: The Quaker Granite forms a massive, discordant pluton.  Despite its massive appearance the adamellite displays petrographic evidence of slight to moderate deformation.  Most quartz phenocrysts are characterised by undulose extinction, and many of the larger biotite flakes also locally show undulose extinction|
29321|Quaker Granite|Lithology|The unit consists mainly of pale grey, fine-grained, slightly to moderately porphyritic (hornblende ) biotite adamellite.  Plagioclase is the most abundant phenocryst - as euhedral to subhedral grains up to 2 cm long.  Oscillatory zoning is common in the plagioclase phenocrysts, some of which have narrow rims of normally zoned albite(?).  Small inclusions of quartz, hornblende and biotite occur in the phenocrysts.  Quartz forms rounded phenocrysts, 1-5 mm across.The fine-grained groundmass consists mainly of quartz, plagioclase, and K-feldspar.  Biotite is the dominant mafic mineral and has two modes of occurrence:  1) as scattered well-formed, relatively large (0.5 - 1.5 mm) discrete flakes and, 2) as aggregates up to ~1 cm across, of relatively small flakes.  Some of the larger clots also contain traces of hornblende.Hornblende is scarce and is absent from some specimens.  It has been extensively replaced by biotite and, less commonly, by actinolite.  Zircon, opaque oxide, and allanite are the most common accessory minerals.  Most samples show slight to moderate alteration; sericite, chlorite, epidote/clinozoisite, sphene, muscovite, and calcite are the most abundant and widespread secondary minerals.The adamellite contains scattered rounded mafic enclaves up to ~75 cm across|
29321|Quaker Granite|Relationships and boundaries|The unit intrudes the Chillagoe Formation and Ootann Granite, and probably also the Muldiva Quartz Monzodiorite (with which it locally forms net-veined complexes).  It is cut by the Carrs Granite.  The adamellite appears to be truncated by the Palmerville Fault.|
29321|Quaker Granite|Age reasons|The adamellite has not been isotopically dated.  It is most probably Late Carboniferous and about the same age (~300 Ma) as the other granites of the Ootann Supersuite.|
29321|Quaker Granite|Comments|The Quaker Granite is a member of the Ootann Supersuite of Champion (1991).|

15764|Quilalar Formation|Name source|Parish of Quilalar, which surrounds Kajabbi Township, near 20o2'S latitude, 140o00'E longitude, 6857-953845*. The Quilalar Fault truncates the Quilalar Formation near 20o11'S latitude, 139o00'E longitude, 6857-710677.|
15764|Quilalar Formation|Geomorphic expression|Quartzite and sandstone in the Quilalar Formation form a distinctive series of about three close-spaced ridges; the silty, dolomitic and ferruginous upper part of the formation is recessive, forming low hills and valleys between the major quartzite units.|
15764|Quilalar Formation|Type section locality|In Prospector, about 55 km north-northeast to Mount Isa, and 5 km north-northwest of old Glenroy homestead, near the Junction of Conglomerate Creek and the Leichhardt River. The base of the section is at latitude 20o17'25"S, longitude 139o42'00"E (6857-644558); the top of the section is 2.5 km to the northeast, at latitude 20o16'35"S, longitude 139o43'10"E (6857-644573). The type section (holostratotype) exposes, from top to base: 120 m of purple siltstone, friable fine-grained feldspathic sandstone, calcareous siltstone, and laminaated shale (Pqx).  500 m of orthoquartzite and massive medium-grained feldspathic quartzite, with minor siltstone partings - the unnamed orthoquartzite member (Pqx).  335 m of dolomitic siltstone and sandstone, dolomite, stromatolitic dolomite, brown feldspathic sandstone, purple shale and siltstone (Pqx).  360 m of massive brown to white feldspathic and clayey sandstone with pebbly beds and minor siltstone (Pqx). This section is overlain disconformably by pebbly beds of the Fiery Creek Volcanics, and underlain by ferruginous sandstone and siltstone of the Lochness Formation of the Myally Subgroup.  Reference Sections (hypostratotypes) are necessary to illustrate the facies variations within the Quilalar Formation. In Mount Oxide, a reference section is located 3 km west-southwest of Alhambra homestead overlying Myally Subgroup rocks. From the base at 6759-308798, 500 m of feldspathic quartzose and dolomitic sandstone are overlain to the north by at least 300 m of dolomite, dolomitic and ferruginous siltstone and sandstone with halite casts; this dolomitic sequence is capped by 50 m of orthoquartzite, the top of which terminates the reference section at 6759-296819. The basal sandstone contains a 50 m-thick trachybasalt unit, the unnamed volcanic member of the Quilalar Formation; the orthoquartzite at the top of the section is probably equivalent to the unnamed orthoquartzite member in the type section. The second reference section is located 17 km west-southwest of Dobbyn, in Alsace from 6858-807028 (base) northwest for 2 km to 6858-795042. Here, 600 m of feldspathic sandstone with basal arkose disconformably overlie acid volcanics of the Argylla Formation; the sandstone is overlain by 450 m of ferruginous sandstone and siltstone, and dolomitic siltstone with thin interbeds of rhyolitic tuff or ashstone. It is overlain unconformably by pebbly sandstone of the Fiery Creek Volcanics.|
15764|Quilalar Formation|Extent|In open to moderately tight anticlines and synclines north, west and southwest of Alhambra (MOUNT OXIDE, GREGORY DOWNS); in a tight to isoclinal 2 to 6 km wide synclinal fold belt extending for about 80 km along the western edge of the Ewen Block; and in tight to moderately tight synclines separated by an anticline in a north-trending belt 10 to15 km wide and 60 km long between the Ewen and Kalkadoon-Leichhardt basement blocks (MYALLY, ALSACE, PROSPECTOR). These two latter fold belts are faulted together south of the Ewen Block, and terminate against the Quilalar and Mount Remarkable Faults. Some Quilalar Formation is present in MARY KATHLEEN, where it is shown as Surprise Creek Beds south of the Gorge Creek-Mount Remarkable Fault, mainly 15 to 20 km southeast of Mount Isa. This belt also extends southwards onto DUCHESS.|
15764|Quilalar Formation|Thickness range|500 to 1500 m; the basal sandstone unit varies from almost zero thickness along the eastern side of the Ewen Block, to 600 m; the dolomitic unit, exclusive of the orthoquartzite member, ranges from 100 to 520 m; the orthoquartzite member varies from 30 m in the northwest to 750 m near Julius Dam, in Prospector.|
15764|Quilalar Formation|Lithology|The basal part of the formation consists of white, grey or bff, medium to coarse-grained feldspathic quartzite, orthoquartzite, fine-grained feldspathic sandstone, clayey sandstone and minor siltstone, shale, conglomerate and trachybasalt; in areas near the Ewen Block the basal rocks include arkose and grit, pyritic sandstone and minor acid tuff and basalt. The upper part is mainly stromatolitic dolomite, brown dolomitic sandstone and siltstone, ferruginous sandstone and siltstone, purple-grey siltstone, siltstone with fine-grained sandstone lenses, orthoquartzite, shale-clast conglomerate and minor green to grey rhyolitic tuff or ashstone. Calc-silicate rocks occur in Pqx in the aureole of the Weberra Granite in Mount Oxide.|
15764|Quilalar Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The Quilalar Formation conformably overlies the Lochness Formation of the Myally Subgroup, and undivided Myally Subgroup; Wilson & others (1977) suggest this contact may also be disconformable, since the underlying Lochness Formation is locally a massive, structureless and mottled siltstone, possibly a palaeosol. The Quilalar Formation overlies basement rocks unconformably. In Alsace, Quilalar Formation quartzite with basal arkosic grit and pebble conglomerate directly overlies ?Leichhardt Metamorphics at Hendersons Soak (6858-720946) and elsewhere along the eastern edge of the Ewen Block; in Prospector, Quilalar Formation arkose and quartzite overlie small inliers of ?Leichhardt Metamorphics unconformably at 6857-7209762, and also overlie Kalkadoon Granite unconformably at Sunday Gully (6857-730573), where cleaved conglomeratic siltstone is also present in the sequence. In Alsace, the formation rests disconformably on acid volcanics of the Argylla Formation, in a series of north-plunging anticlines 15 to 25 km southwest of Dobbyn, and along the eastern edge of the Ewen Block at Mistake Creek (6858-743316). The Quilalar Formation is overlain unconformably by pale pink to purple conglomeratic sandstone of the Fiery Creek Volcanics; this contact is an angular unconformity in many areas of Mount Oxide, west of and just east of Alhambra, but is a disconformity throughout Alsace and Prospector. Where the Fiery Creek Volcanics are absent, basal conglomeratic quartzite of the Surprise Creek Formation overlies the silty and dolomitic sequence of the Quilalar Formation unconformably or disconformably. Weberra Granite intrudes dolomitic rocks of Quilalar Formation in Mount Oxide, a few kilometres west-northwest of Alhambra.|
15764|Quilalar Formation|Age reasons|Between 1780 m.y. (Argylla Formation) and 1680 m.y. (Carters Bore Rhyolite, a probable correlative of the Fiery Creek Volcanics) (Page, 1978).|
15764|Quilalar Formation|Correlations|Probably equivalent to the Ballara Quartzite and Corella Formation of the Mary Kathleen Group; possibly equivalent to Stanbroke beds and Makbat Sandstone.|

24467|Quinine Spring Granite|Type section locality|Outcrops of medium-grained equigranular to porphyritic biotite-muscovite granite along Four Mile Creek from GR 249523 (Einasleigh 1:100 000 Sheet area) downstream to a fence-line at GR 271558 (Mount Surprise 1:100 000 Sheet area).|
24467|Quinine Spring Granite|Description at type locality|Reference locality: At GR 276425 (Einasleigh 1:100 000 Sheet area), medium to coarse-grained porphyritic biotite-muscovite granite, with coarse muscovite 'books' 1 to 2 cm across and subsequent K-feldspar megacrysts up to 3 cm in size, crops out.|
24467|Quinine Spring Granite|Extent|The unit crops out in two main areas. The largest is an irregularly shaped batholith about 140 km2 in area which extends from approximately 2 km southwest of Rosella Plains homestead to about 15 km northeast of Carpentaria Downs homestead. The other main outcrop area extends along the western side of the Einasleigh River, northwest of Twelve Mile Swamp, from GR 010410 (Einasleigh 1:100 000 Sheet area) in a southeasterly direction to near Washpool Lagoon (GR 092350).|
24467|Quinine Spring Granite|Lithology|Medium to coarse-grained equigranular to porphyritic biotite-muscovite granite. The granite is pegmatitic in places, and locally a foliation is present. Muscovite 'books', in places up to 2 cm across, are common, particularly in the southern part of the main outcrop area, for example in the reference locality. The porphyritic variety contains pink K-feldspar megacrysts up to 3 cm across. In the northern part of the main outcrop area the unit is most commonly equigranular.|
24467|Quinine Spring Granite|Relationships and boundaries|The granite intrudes the Proterozoic Einasleigh Metamorphics and is in contact with the Oak River Granodiorite; however, no intrusive relationship has been observed. It is overlain by Cainozoic basalt.|
24467|Quinine Spring Granite|Age reasons|Uncertain; Middle Proterozoic or Siluro-Devonian. The porphyritic granite bears some resemblance to the Siluro-Devonian Dumbano and McKinnons Creek Granites to the south. These granites are locally weakly foliated.|

23931|Quinton Formation|Unit history|The unit was previously mapped as part of the Graveyard Creek Formation (now Group) (White, 1959, 1962, 1965).  The name was first published and fully described by Withnall & others (1988), but was not formally defined.|
23931|Quinton Formation|Geomorphic expression|The unit generally subdued topography, especially where mudstone is dominant.  Strike lines are better developed in the Chinaman Creek area in the west, where arenite is dominant.|
23931|Quinton Formation|Type section locality|Chinaman Creek (shown on some maps as Graveyard Creek), between 7859 665696 (base) and 610696 (top).  See Withnall & others (1988, figure 26 and page 40) for more details.|
23931|Quinton Formation|Description at type locality|About 5000 m of lithofeldspathic arenite, mudstone, and conglomerate are exposed, with no obvious repetition by folding.  The arenites are generally coarse-grained and thick to very thick-bedded (relatively proximal turbidite facies).  See Withnall & others (1988, figure 26 and page 40) for more details|
23931|Quinton Formation|Extent|From 'Pandanus Creek' in the west to Tomcat creek in the east, and from the head of Graveyard Creek in the north to the large laterite plateau in central part of BURGES   a total area of approximately 300 km2.|
23931|Quinton Formation|Thickness range|The unit is about 5000 m thick in the type section, but it thins eastwards and is probably less than 2000 m in the Top Hut-Tomcat Creek area.|
23931|Quinton Formation|Lithology|Lithofeldspathic arenite and mudstone, local conglomerate and limestone. Arenites are thin to very thick bedded, commonly graded, with erosive bases, planar and ripple cross laminae, and soft sediment folds (Bouma cycles).  Rocks become more distal in aspect (i.e. thin-bedded and finer grained) east of Martins Well.  Minor volcaniclastic rocks occur in the area south and east of Top Hut Yards.  Further brief notes on lithology included in Relationshipsboundaries section....|
23931|Quinton Formation|Fossils|Llandovery graptolites, corals, trilobites, and conodonts have been found in the lower part, and Ludlow to Pridoli corals and conodonts occur in the Magpie Creek Limestone Member.  See Withnall & others (1988) for more details.|
23931|Quinton Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The Quinton Formation conformably overlies the Crooked Creek Conglomerate, and locally unconformably overlies the Judea Formation.  It is overlain possibly disconformably by the Shield Creek Formation which is predominantly feldspathic arenite.  The distal facies of the Quinton Formation is easily distinguished from the latter by being generally thin-bedded arenite and mudstone.  The proximal facies is more difficult to distinguish, but arenites in the Quinton Formation are more lithic.  Polymictic conglomerate is less abundant than in the Crooked Creek Conglomerate.|
23931|Quinton Formation|Age reasons|Llandovery graptolites, corals, trilobites, and conodonts have been found in the lower part, and Ludlow to Pridoli corals and conodonts occur in the Magpie Creek Limestone Member.  See Withnall & others (1988) for more details.|

28949|Ramsay Crossing Member|Name source|Ramsay Crossing (a low-water ford of The Narrows channel); GR 303,000E, 7,784,500N, Gladstone 1:100 000 topographic sheet.|
28949|Ramsay Crossing Member|Unit history|Part of The Narrows Beds (Kirkegaard et al, 1970) and part of the Rundle Formation (Henstridge and Missen, 1982).|
28949|Ramsay Crossing Member|Type section locality|69 m of oil shale with lesser interbeds of claystone and minor impure dolomite; from 266.3 to 335.1 m in drill hole ERD 169 (GR 300,999E, 7,380,998N Gladstone 1:100 000 topographic sheet). The dark yellowish-brown to olive-brown oil shale contains two major greenish-grey claystone beds (from 266.3 to 272.0 m and 390.1 to 299.2 m in the type section). Lesser moderately thick to very thick claystone and clayey oil shale beds occur interbedded within the upper and basal oil shale units (from 274.9 to 278.6 m, 282.7 to 283.8 m, 286.2 to 287.2 m and 310.0 to 310.5 m, 313.0 to 314.3 m, 325.0 to 326.0 m in the type section respectively). A yellowish-grey impure dolomite concentration is contained within the type section from 274.5 to 274.9 m. Cyclicity of lithologies is a feature with oil shale grading upwards through clayey oil shale to claystone, commonly overlain by minor carbonaceous material.|
28949|Ramsay Crossing Member|Extent|Subcrops in an area of about 73 km2 in The Narrows Graben, NW of Gladstone, Queensland. Part of the unit is exposed in a shallow excavation (slot cut) located between 7,380,611N to 7,380,592N and 303,847E to 304,242E. Very sparse weathered outcrops are recorded. The member has been identified from drill hole core.|
28949|Ramsay Crossing Member|Thickness range|68.8 m (estimated true thickness 67.8 m corrected for an apparent dip of 9o in ERD 169) in type section. Range of true thickness of the member as intersected in drill holes is 30.1 m to 81.2 m.|
28949|Ramsay Crossing Member|Lithology|Oil shale, dark yellowish-brown to olive-brown; brecciated and peloidal, well laminated to poorly laminated in part; very thinly to very thickly bedded (up to 2 m); calcareous, clayey and carbonaceous cyclicity. Major and minor interbeds of calcareous greyish-green claystone, rare discontinuous yellowish-grey impure dolomite concentrations and traces of very dark grey carbonaceous shale. Dolomite concentrations tend to be very thick (up to 2.5 m) and are in greater abundance to the northwest and east in The Narrows Graben. Along the southeastern margin of the graben the oil shale beds become attenuated and there is also an associated thickening of the commonly silty to sandy claystone. Claystone and brecciated clayey oil shale generally show bioturbation features. Ostracode tests are abundant with mino gastropods, vertebrate remains (crocodile, turtle), fish fragments and coprolites. Plant remains in the more carbonaceous material include reedy monocots.|

15955|Red Mountain Formation|Name source|Red Mountain, which lies 2 km north of Rubyvale (723114 m, Rubyvale 1:100 000 Sheet area).|
15955|Red Mountain Formation|Unit history|No other names have been applied to the unit. Robertson (1974) described them under the name Red Mountain Beds in an unpublished report and the name "Red Mountain Beds" appears on a map in Siemon (1977).|
15955|Red Mountain Formation|Type section locality|The western scarp of Red Mountain (723114 m, Rubyvale 1:100 000) where 13 m of lateritised poorly sorted pebbly sandstone and claystone overlie 1 m of massive silcrete and the Devonian Retreat Granite. The top of the mountain is a flat, partly stripped lateritised poorly sorted pebbly sandstone and claystone overlie 1 m of massive silcrete and the Devonian Retreat Granite. The top of the mountain is a flat, partly stripped lateritised planation surface and could approximate the final depositional surface of the unit.|
15955|Red Mountain Formation|Extent|Isolated mesas extending northeast and north from Red Mountain on the Rubyvale 1:100 000 Sheet area. About 15 km2 in all.|
15955|Red Mountain Formation|Thickness range|The maximum measured thickness is 15 m, however the unit may exceed 30 m in places, where its base is concealed by colluvial cover.|
15955|Red Mountain Formation|Lithology|In the type area Robertson (1974) records under the name Red Mountain Beds a sequence of coarse, angular, consolidated gravels with a silty clayey matrix. The pebbles include angular fragments of metamorphics, highly weathered volcanics, granite, and rounded pebbles and boulders of billy (silcrete) and of 'Kettle beds' (now though to be Permian). However, the dominant lithology in most areas is a ferruginised or mottled, ill-sorted pebbly sandy mudstone. The angular pebbles and poor sorting are diagnostic in distinguishing the unit from Permian sediments which occur in the area. The deposits are probably of fluvial origin and derived from local sources.|
15955|Red Mountain Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The Red Mountain Formation is flat lying and overlies a silicified surface or is unconformable on Palaeozoic granites and on the Permian "Kettle Conglomerate member" of the Aldebaran Sandstone. The top of the formation is a lateritised surface of low relief. The relationship between the formation and Tertiary basalts or the Emerald Beds is not known. Robertson (1974) thought that the "Red Mountain Beds" might be younger than the "sapphire wash" of this area, but this seems unlikely in view of its position in the landscape and the well developed laterite.|
15955|Red Mountain Formation|Age reasons|No fossils have been found. The unit is tentatively regarded as mid Tertiary as it overlies a silcrete bed and predates a lateritised surface. The laterites of this region would seem to be of mid to late Tertiary age, from their relationships to dated basalts, and silcretes overlie an early Tertiary unit further to the north (cf Grimes, in press). The relationship between the formation and the basalt flows and plugs in the area or to the Emerald Beds (both of which are of mid Tertiary age) is unfortunately not known.|

22751|Retchford Granite|Name source|The unit is named after the Retchford gold mine located ~300 m south of the pluton (Richards, 1981).|
22751|Retchford Granite|Unit history|The pluton was previously included in the Almaden Granite (Best, 1962;  de Keyser & Wolff, 1964;  Branch, 1966).|
22751|Retchford Granite|Geomorphic expression|The Retchford Granite forms undulating to hilly terrain with scattered boulders and bouldery outcrops.  It is characterised by pale to medium tones on aerial photographs.|
22751|Retchford Granite|Extent|The Retchford Granite forms several small elongate plutons exposed over an area of ~2 km2, 4 km east-northeast and north of Fluorspar.|
22751|Retchford Granite|General description|STRUCTURE AND METAMORPHISM:: The Retchford Granite forms an essentially unmetamorphosed, massive, discordant pluton.MINERALISATION:: No mineral deposits are known in the adamellite.|
22751|Retchford Granite|Lithology|Fine to medium-grained, pale pink (hornblende-) biotite adamellite is the main rock type.  Minor aplite as small pods and dykes is also present.The main minerals present in the adamellite are quartz, plagioclase, and K-feldspar, together with minor biotite, opaque oxide(s) and pyrite.  The one thin section of a sample from this pluton examined also contained traces of hornblende (mainly as small inclusions in large plagioclase grains), but according to Richards (1981) much of the pluton is devoid of amphibole.  Most grains are between 0.5 and 1 mm in length, but quartz and plagioclase grains range up to 3 mm across.  Granophyric intergrowths are common.  Quartz grains show undulose extinction.  Plagioclases form subhedral laths with cores of andesine (~An40; Richards, 1981), commonly mantled by rims of zoned, more sodic plagioclase.  The designated type locality is at GR 2495 80917, ~700 m northeast of the Retchford gold mine (abandoned).Plagioclase grains in contact with K-feldspar are locally rimmed by a thin selvage of more sodic plagioclase (albite).  A similar feature was described in samples of Ootann Granite by Richards (1981) who determined the composition of the selvage to be ~An7.  A few of the larger plagioclase grains contain subhedral grains (0.2 mm long) of hornblende, pleochroic from dark green to pale yellowish green.  The cores of relatively calcic plagioclase are commonly partly to extensively replaced by sericite, locally accompanied by rare epidote/clinozoisite.K-feldspar is mainly orthoclase microperthite which forms euhedral to anhedral grains up to 2 mm long and relatively small, anhedral grains granophyrically intergrown with quartz.Biotite forms subhedral grains, typically 0.5 to 1 mm in length.  The grains are pleochroic from very dark brown to pale yellowish brown (straw), contain sparse small inclusions of opaque oxide, and are commonly partly replaced by chlorite and secondary muscovite.  Aggregates of smaller, ragged biotite grains similar to those found, for example, in the Ruddygore and Almaden Granodiorites were not observed in the thin section examined.Scattered grains of pyrite, commonly altered to secondary iron oxides are fairly common.|
22751|Retchford Granite|Relationships and boundaries|The adamellite intrudes the Redcap Dacite (Volcanics) and Almaden Granodiorite.  Its relationship with the Hiker Granodiorite is unknown.  The pluton is cut by dykes and small pods of aplite.|
22751|Retchford Granite|Age reasons|The unit is most probably Late Carboniferous.  The adamellite has not been isotopically dated, but it post-dates the Almaden Granodiorite which has yielded Rb/Sr isotopic ages ranging between 301 Ma and 302 Ma (Richards, 1981).|
22751|Retchford Granite|Comments|The Retchford Granite forms a small heterogeneous pluton and is a member of the Ootann Supersuite.  According to Richards (1981) it is similar mineralogically to the Ootann Granite exposed farther south.|

24471|Revenue Granite|Name source|The granite is named after the Revenue group of mines and prospects, about 8-9 k, NNW of Duchess, Duchess 1:100 000 Sheet area (Duchess 1:250 000 Sheet area).|
24471|Revenue Granite|Unit history|Previously mapped was Wonga Granite (Carter & Opik, 1963).|
24471|Revenue Granite|Type section locality|About 11.5 km N of Duchess, from GR 813496 to GR 823496, drained by unnamed tributaries of the Little Burke River. Here the granite consists mainly of medium to coarse-grained, foliated biotite leucogranite together with some non-foliated aplite and pegmatite (mainly around the margins).|
24471|Revenue Granite|Extent|The granite crops out mainly as an elongate pluton, up to 3.5 km wide, about 6 to 18 km N of Duchess. The small pod of granite mapped as part of this unit about 4 km NW of Duchess may be part of the main body displaced along the Saint Andrews Fault.|
24471|Revenue Granite|Lithology|Mainly medium to coarse-grained, even-grained to slightly porphyritic, foliated, commonly partly recrystallised biotite leucogranite. In places, for example, at GR 793456, the marginal zone of the granite consists of pink, fine to medium-grained, even-grained, non-foliated aplite which grades towards the centre of the pluton into pink medium-grained, even-grained, non-foliated aplite which grades towards the centre of the pluton into pink medium-grained, even-grained biotite leucogranite with a primary flow foliation. The granite contains sparse mafic xenoliths and large inclusions and pendants of mainly calc-silicate rocks probably derived from the enclosing Corella Formation. A gneissic foliation developed in the granite NE of the Revenue group of mines shows crenulations with wave lengths of about 30 cem and amplitudes of about 15 cm. The assertions by Joplin & Walker (1961) that this crenulated gneissic granite represents metasomatised calc-silicate rocks seems unlikely, because contacts between calc-silicates of the Corella Formation and crenulated granite are sharp (resolvable within 1 to 2 cm) and appear cross-cutting. Swarms of tourmaline-bearing, graphic quartz-feldspar pegmatite dykes in the adjacent Corella Formation hav ebeen mapped as part of the Revenue Granite.|
24471|Revenue Granite|Relationships and boundaries|The Revenue Granite intrudes the Corellla Formation and some amphibolitic metadolerite bodies.|
24471|Revenue Granite|Age reasons|Proterozoic|
24471|Revenue Granite|Proposed publication|Blake & others, in preparation (R233)|
24471|Revenue Granite|Comments|The Revenue Granite may be a correlative of the Burstall and Overlander Granites and of the granites of the Myubee and Mount Erle Igneous Complexes. Calc-silicates of the Corella Formation adjacent to the granite SE of Green Creek Tank (GR 795521) have been extensively metasomatised and converted to skarns.|

24472|Riversleigh Siltstone|Name source|From Riversleigh station; the homestead is located 2 km southwest of the junction of the Gregory and O'Shannassy Rivers at 6659-620941.|
24472|Riversleigh Siltstone|Unit history|The rocks now mapped as Riversleigh Siltstone were previously assigned to the Ploughed Mountain Beds, Pradise Creek Formation and Pilpah Sandstone by Carter & others (1961).|
24472|Riversleigh Siltstone|Type section locality|Holostratotype: A composite type section comprising a holostratotype covering the upper 2400 m and a parastratotype covering the basal 800 m is defined. The holostratotype is situated 13 km due north of Riversleigh homestead and exteands from 604073 (base) to 576070 (top) in the Lawn Hill 1:100 000 Sheet area. It can be subdivided into four informal subunits:  200 m - fine clayey siltstone (top).  400 m - leached carbonaceous shale.  300 m - fine to coarse grained gritty sandstone.  1500 m - laminated siltstone, thinly interbedded with coarse siliceous siltstone and minor dolomite (base).  Parastratotype: The parastratotype is situated 8 km south of the holostratotype and extends from 6660-1012 (base) to 6660-624007 (top). It is 800 m thick and comprises coarse quartz siltstone with three fine grained clayey dolomitic sandstone beds each between 100 and 150 m thick.|
24472|Riversleigh Siltstone|Extent|Discontinuously as a long narrow belt of broadly folded rocks from Musselbrook Creek in the Bowthorn 1:100 000 Sheet area, through the Mount Oscar, Lawn Hill, Riversleigh, Mount Oxide, Mammoth Mines, Kennedy Gap and Undilla 1:100 000 Sheet areas to the Yelvertoft 1:100 000 Sheet area in the south. It is best exposed in the southern part of the Lawn Hill and Riversleigh Sheet areas where it crops out in the cores of numerous basins and domes.|
24472|Riversleigh Siltstone|Thickness range|The unit is 3200 m thick in the combined type sections but is only 800 m thick in the Ploughed Mountain anticline. A minimum of 300 to 400 m is present between the southern part of the Riversleigh Sheet area and the northern part of the Undilla Sheet area.|
24472|Riversleigh Siltstone|Lithology|South of the type sections, only the lower part of the Riversleigh Siltstone crops out. These rocks mainly comprise coarse quartz siltstone and fine to medium clayey sandstone. To the north of the type sections in the Ploughed Mountain anticline, about 800 m of laminatead siltstone, fine sandstone and carbonaceous shale crop out.|
24472|Riversleigh Siltstone|Relationships and boundaries|The unit conformably overlies the Shady Bore Quartzite. Usually the boundary is sharp but in places siltstone of the Riversleigh Siltstone intertongues with orthoquartzite of the Shady Bore Quartzite. Conformably overlying the Riversleigh Siltstone is massive arenite of the Termite Range Formation. In the type section this boundary is sharp but intertonguing of the two units occurs to the north. South of the Gregory River, the Riversleigh Siltstone is the youngest outcropping formation in the McNamara Group. Here it is unconformably overlain by Cambrian sediments.|

25745|Robertson River Subgroup|Unit history|Robertson River Metamorphics (White, 1959, 1965) and Robertson River Formation (Withnall & Mackenzie, 1980) as outlined in the Introduction.|
25745|Robertson River Subgroup|Constituents|The constituent formations of the Robertson River Subgroup are, in ascending stratigraphic order, the Daniel Creek Formation, Dead Horse Metabasalt, Corbett Formation, and Lane Creek Formation.|
25745|Robertson River Subgroup|Extent|Crops out as a broad belt, 50 km wide and 150 km long, extending from around Gilberton homestead to near Dagworth homestead, and mostly between the Gilbert River and the Newcastle Range. The total area is about 5000 km2.|
25745|Robertson River Subgroup|Thickness range|The thickness of the subgroup is difficult to determine because of the intense multiple deformation which has affected much of its outcrop area. A composite section made up of the type and reference sections of its constituent formations is about 4000 m thick. This is only a rough order of magnitude because the constituent units range considerably in thickness. For example, the Dead Horse Metabasalt, which is up to 1000 m thick, pinches out entirely in the northern half of the outcrop area.|
25745|Robertson River Subgroup|Lithology|Mainly cleaved mudstone, siltstone, fine-grained sandstone, and metabasalt grading eastwards into mica schist, quartzite and amphibolite. The sedimentary rocks are locally calcareous and the finer grained rocks are locally variably carbonaceous.|
25745|Robertson River Subgroup|Relationships and boundaries|The Robertson River Subgroup, which is part of the Etheridge Group, conformably overlies the Bernecker Creek Formation, and is overlain conformably by the Townley Formation. Criteria for recognising these boundaries are included in the definitions of the Daniel and Lane Creek Formations, respectively. The subgroup is intruded by the Proterozoic Cobbold Metadolerite, by a variety of Proterozoic and Siluro-Devonian granitoids, and by various late Palaeozoic igneous rocks. It is overlain unconformably by various late Palaeozoic volcanic units and the Jurassic Hampstead Sandstone.|
25745|Robertson River Subgroup|Age reasons|The minimum age of 1570+/-30 Ma (mid-Proterozoic) obtained by dating the earliest deformational-metamorphic event in the Etheridge Group (Black & others, 1979), also applies to the Robertson River Subgroup and its constituent formations.|
25745|Robertson River Subgroup|Proposed publication|Queensland Government Mining Journal|
25745|Robertson River Subgroup|Comments|White (1959, 1965) gave the name Robertson River Metamorphics to an area of metamorphic rocks in the Robertson River area. Subsequent work by the joint BMR-GSQ party and James Cook University staff and students demonstrated that these graded westwards into low-grade metasedimentary correlatives. Having established the stratigraphic position of these low-grade correlatives in the Etheridge Group, Withnall & Mackenzie (1980) changed the name of the unit to Robertson River Formation, and redefined it to include both the low and high-grade metamorphic rocks. They informally divided it into upper and lower subunits. The lower subunit was effectively subdivided into two more metasedimentary subunits by the Dead Horse Metabasalt Member. Each of these three metasedimentary subunits is lithologically distinct and it is now considered desirable to name them as formations. The Dead Horse Metabasalt Member is also redefined as a formation. The Robertson River Formation is redefined as a subgroup. The name is retained because, although the formations are readily distinguished in their low-grade parts, the distinctions become less apparent at higher grades. Consequently some workers may find it useful to have an overall term for the high-grade metamorphic rocks. Field work was completed in the higher grade parts of the subgroup before the detailed stratigraphy was established in the low-grade rocks. The boundaries can be extrapolated into the high-grade areas, but have not been mapped in detail. Criteria which could be applied by subsequent field workers to locate the boundaries more accurately, are given with definitions of the individual formations.|

16185|Robin Hood Granodiorite|Name source|"Robin Hood" Homestead at GR 853 146 (Forsayth 1:100 000 Sheet area).|
16185|Robin Hood Granodiorite|Unit history|Robin Hood Granite (White 1959; 1962b, c; 1965).|
16185|Robin Hood Granodiorite|Type section locality|The type area given by White (1959) was "one mile (1.6 km) west of Robin Hood Homestead on the Forsayth track". However as this point lies within the Robertson River Metamorphics it is suggested that a more appropriate type area should be given. Excellent exposures of grey hornblende-biotite granodiorite with quartz phenocrysts crop out along the Robin Hood-Fish Hole track between GR 861 151 and 865 220; this is designated the new type area.|
16185|Robin Hood Granodiorite|Extent|Crops out in a belt 50 km long and up to 20 km wide between "Robin Hood" and "Percyvale" Homesteads.|
16185|Robin Hood Granodiorite|Lithology|Pink to grey, massive, hornblende-biotite granodiorite with quartz phenocrysts. The unit is remarkably uniform over the whole outcrop area.|
16185|Robin Hood Granodiorite|Relationships and boundaries|Intrudes the Proterozoic Einasleigh Metamorphics, Robertson River Metamorphics and Digger Creek Granite (new name). Unconformably overlain by the Carboniferous Newcastle Range Volcanics, Permian Agate Creek Volcanics and Jurassic-Cretaceous sandstone.|
16185|Robin Hood Granodiorite|Age reasons|Probably Silurian or Devonian. Rb/Sr dating on a biotite sample gave a minimum age of 426 million years (Black, 1973).|
16185|Robin Hood Granodiorite|Comments|Discussion: White (1959) defined the Robin Hood Granite as "a hornblende-biotite granite". Petrographic studies show that the unit is a hornblende-biotite granodiorite rather than a granite. Granodiorite is therefore considered a more appropriate lithological term and the name of the unit is changed to Robin Hood Granodiorite. Areas of muscovite leucogranite and pegmatite were included in the Robin Hood Granite on the Georgetown and Gilberton 1:250 000 Geological Series Maps (White, 1962b, c) although this lithology was not mentioned in either the map legend or the explanatory notes. Recent mapping (Bain et al. in prep), isotopic dating (Black, 1973) and geochemical studies (Sheraton and Labonne, in press) show that the muscovite leucogranite is easily mappable as a unit, separate from the hornblende-biotite granodiorite, that it is probably much older and that it is probably derived from a different magma to that of the granodiorite.|

16201|Rockfields Member|Name source|Parish of Rockfields, County of Clarke (Clarke River 1:250 000 Cadastral map).|
16201|Rockfields Member|Unit history|The member was previously mapped as part of the Bundock Creek Formation (now Group) (White, 1959, 1962, 1965).  The name was first published by Withnall & others (1988), and described in full but not formally defined.|
16201|Rockfields Member|Geomorphic expression|The unit forms a series of low strike ridges, sparsely vegetated with stunted silver leaf ironbark and quinine bush.  Individual bands of white and brownish tones on the aerial photos correspond with tuffs and redbeds, respectively.|
16201|Rockfields Member|Type section locality|In the type section of the Bulgeri Formation in the Broken River between 7859 578447 (base) and 560444 (top).  The grid reference is based on the Agd66d datum.|
16201|Rockfields Member|Description at type locality|The section is 795 m thick, and begins with a polymictic, pebble to cobble conglomerate overlain by red and drab, fine to medium-grained lithofeldspathic sandstone, grey mudstone, variegated and greyish red fine-grained redbeds, thin, reworked, fine-grained tuff beds, and minor rip-up-clast conglomerate.  See Withnall & others (1988, figure 52 and page 81) and Lang (1985, 1986a) for more details.|
16201|Rockfields Member|Extent|A sinuous folded belt from about 7858-485335 near Pages Dam in the south to about 7859-585545 in the hinge of the Atherton Creek Anticlinorium.  The grid reference is based on the AGD datum.|
16201|Rockfields Member|Thickness range|795 m in the type section, thinning progressively to the northeast until it wedges out near the hinge of the Atherton Creek Anticlinorium at about 7859-587545.  The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.|
16201|Rockfields Member|Lithology|Fine to medium-grained lithofeldspathic sandstone, mudstone, fine-grained redbeds, reworked tuff, and rip-up-clast conglomerate as in the type section.  Polymictic conglomerate also occurs at the base of the unit.  Towards the Clarke River Fault in the south, the unit becomes coarser grained until it contains lithofacies assemblages indistinguishable from the rest of the Bulgeri Formation.|
16201|Rockfields Member|Fossils|Rare Cyrtospirifer sp. and bivalves have been found near the base in both outcrop and in GSQ Clarke River 2 (Lang, 1985, 1986a; Law, 1986).  Rare plant remains, usually indeterminate but including some lycopod casts, are present.  Non-marine fish remains occur sporadically throughout the unit, in both the fine-grained redbeds and foresets and channel lags in the sandstone.|
16201|Rockfields Member|Relationships and boundaries|The Rockfields Member forms the basal part of Bulgeri Formation, overlying the Mytton Formation of the Broken River Group with slight angular unconformity (a few degrees) to disconformity. The base is generally marked by a pebble conglomerate containing abundant quartz and quartzite clasts.  The sandstones are less lithic than those in the underlying Mytton Formation and are commonly interbedded with redbeds.  The member is distinguished from the rest of the Bulgeri Formation by being generally finer grained and containing abundant soft-sediment deformation.  The unit is generally overlain by white, pebble conglomerate and very coarse sandstone of the undivided Bulgeri Formation. However, between the north branch of Gorge Creek at 7859-641537 and where it wedges out in the hinge of the Atherton Anticlinorium, it is conformably overlain by the Stopem Blockem Conglomerate Member.|
16201|Rockfields Member|Age reasons|The unit is most likely of Late Devonian (Famennian) age because of Cyrtospirifer, although it could be as old as Frasnian.|

23943|Rollingstone Granite|Unit history|Wyatt & others (1970) included the Rollingstone Granite in an unnamed granitoid unit, C-Pg, which contained granite, adamellite and some granodiorite.|
23943|Rollingstone Granite|Geomorphic expression|The granite generally forms part of the steep, rugged coastal scarp. Areas of outcrop are very rocky, consisting of abundant large boulders and tors.|
23943|Rollingstone Granite|Type section locality|A hill at (8159-357934), just west of Rollingstone township.  The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.|
23943|Rollingstone Granite|Description at type locality|Composed of mottled, cream and pink, fine-grained, slightly to moderately porphyritic, biotite granite.|
23943|Rollingstone Granite|Extent|The Rollingstone Granite crops out as several irregularly shaped bodies in the north of ROLLINGSTONE. One body, 7km2 in area, crops out on the eastern side of the Paluma Range between the townships of Kinduro and Rollingstone (from which the name is derived). Three small bodies (each up to 1km2) lie just to the south of Rollingstone. A larger body (approximately 9km2) crops out in the Little Crystal Creek National Park area and extends north of ROLLINGSTONE. In addition, an area of some 3km2 has been interpreted from aerial photography and company report data (C.R. 6852) in dense tropical rainforest near the headwaters of Blue Gum Creek.|
23943|Rollingstone Granite|Lithology|The Rollingstone Granite is a mottled cream and pink, fine to medium-grained, slightly to abundantly porphyritic, biotite granite. Phenocrysts are quartz, K-feldspar, plagioclase up to 2cm.|
23943|Rollingstone Granite|Relationships and boundaries|The Rollingstone Granite intrudes both the Paluma Rhyolite and Clemant Microgranite.|
23943|Rollingstone Granite|Age reasons|A sample from the Rollingstone Granite was included in the Rb/Sr isochron of Webb (1969) and Wyatt & others (1970) that suggested an Early Carboniferous age (342±7 Ma) for the "Oweenee Granite". Although this age is probably not reliable because of the mixing of samples from different units, an Early Carboniferous age is consistent with the relationships.

23948|Ruddygore Granodiorite|Name source|The unit was named by Richards (1981) after Ruddygore copper mine, which is located in the granodiorite about 3 km northeast of Chillagoe.|
23948|Ruddygore Granodiorite|Unit history|Previously mapped as part of the Almaden Granite by Best (1962), de Keyser & Wolff (1964), and Branch (1966).|
23948|Ruddygore Granodiorite|Geomorphic expression|The unit forms mainly gently undulating terrain with scattered boulders and bouldery hills.  Prominent bouldery hills of black weathering granodiorite occur north of Chillagoe and are known locally as 'metal hills' because of the metallic ring produced when the boulders are struck with a hammer.  Most areas underlain by the granodiorite are characterised by open drainage patterns and pale to medium tones on aerial photographs.|
23948|Ruddygore Granodiorite|Type section locality|The proposed type area is Coonbeta Hill, around GR 2380 81028.  The unit is well exposed in this area and readily accessible from Chillagoe.|
23948|Ruddygore Granodiorite|Extent|The granodiorite forms an ovoid pluton of about 350 km2 (Richards, 1981).  It extends from about 2.5 km north of Calcifer (abandoned site) to north of the Walsh River.|
23948|Ruddygore Granodiorite|General description|Alteration:  Most, if not all, of the Ruddygore Granodiorite has undergone slight to extensive hydrothermal alteration.  The most common secondary minerals are sericite, muscovite, chlorite, epidote/clinozoisite, actinolite and sphene.  Calcic plagioclase grains are extensively replaced by sericite, generally accompanied by epidote/clinozoisite and rare muscovite and sphene, whereas rims of more sodic plagioclase are little altered.  Biotite grains are commonly partly replaced by secondary muscovite and partly to completely replaced by chlorite, generally accompanied by some epidote/clinozoisite and/or sphene.  Hornblende grains are partly to extensively replaced by actinolite or chlorite, commonly with some associated sphene and epidote/clinozoisite. Scattered secondary iron oxide-stained patches are present locally in the granodiorite.  The secondary iron oxides have probably replaced sulphide minerals.  The alteration is reported to display a crude zonation in places (Broadhurst, 1949;  Richards, 1981).  According to Richards the first indication of alteration in the outer zone is a change from brown to red-brown in the colour of biotite grains.  This is followed by conversion of biotite to chlorite, epidote/clinozoisite and sphene.  Orthoclase, plagioclase and hornblende remain virtually unaffected.  In more extensively altered rocks, such as those exposed in the Ruddygore mine area, the mafic minerals are generally completely altered and feldspar grains are cloudy or replaced by sericite.  Chlorite grains commonly have a bleached appearance (Stillwell, 1947).  ENDOSKARNS::  consist mainly of metasomatically altered granodiorite which formed adjacent to contacts with calcareous units of the Chillagoe Formation, are not as extensively developed in the Ruddygore Granodiorite as in the Almaden Granodiorite to the south.  Several small outcrops of extensively modified granodiorite occur in the Zillmanton area.STRUCTURE AND METAMORPHISM::  The Ruddygore Granodiorite is an essentially massive, unmetamorphosed, discordant pluton.  Richards (1981) reported a vertical foliation in the granodiorite near the Walsh River, at about GR 2405 81109.MINERALISATION:: The Ruddygore Granodiorite contains the Ruddygore copper deposit and the Metal Creek copper prospect, both of which represent examples of porphyry copper-type mineralisation.  Jensen (1941) reported that traces of alluvial gold, and a thin gold-bearing quartz veins had been found in the granodiorite southwest of the Ruddygore mine.|
23948|Ruddygore Granodiorite|Lithology|Grey, medium-grained, slightly porphyritic hornblende-biotite granodiorite is the dominant rock type.  Rounded inclusions of mafic granodiorite or diorite, up to 2 m in diameter (generally <15 cm) are locally abundant. The granodiorite consists mainly of a network of euhedral to subhedral plagioclase, biotite and hornblende grains which are partly enveloped by and poikilitically enclosed in irregular quartz and K-feldspar grains. Plagioclases range from 1 mm to 1.5 cm in length, and generally show well-developed polysynthetic twinning. Quartz grains commonly show slightly undulose extinction, and some K-feldspar grains contain inclusions of microperthitic albite(?). Hornblendes range from 0.5 to 8 mm in length, are commonly twinned, contain scattered small inclusions of plagioclase, quartz, opaque oxide and apatite, and are pleochroic from yellow-green to dark green or, more rarely, blue-green.  Some of the larger grains are partly rimmed and replaced by biotite.  Accessory minerals include apatite, zircon, opaque minerals, sphene, dark brown allanite, and tourmaline (as small needles in quartz and orthoclase).  The opaque oxide is mainly magnetite with exsolution lamellae of ilmenite; discrete ilmenite grains are rare (Richards, 1981).  The opaque oxides are commonly associated with the mafic minerals, particularly biotite.  Locally, e.g., at GR 2340 81117 and in the Ruddygore mine area, the Ruddygore Granodiorite contain miarolitic cavities up to 15 cm long and 8 cm wide.  At GR 2340 81117 some are filled with an outer layer of pale pink potassium feldspar and an inner zone of quartz, whereas in the Ruddygore mine area the cavities are filled or partly filled mainly with quartz crystals, commonly with minor associated calcite and malachite.  Vuggy quartz veins are also common in the granodiorite exposed in the Ruddygore mine area. ENCLAVES:: Xenoliths are of variable composition, but mafic granodiorite, diorite, or quartz diorite are by far the most common.  These have the same mineralogy as the host but the minerals are of finer grainsize and are present in different proportions.  Average grainsize ranges from 1 mm up to about 2 mm.  Plagioclases and mafic minerals tend to form a mesh of euhedral to subhedral grains poikilitically enclosed by relatively large, highly irregular quartz and K-feldspar grains.  Irregular quartz and K-feldspar grains also fill interstices.  Plagioclase and hornblende predominate in inclusions with relatively low quartz contents.  The mafic minerals occur mainly as discrete grains, rarely as aggregates of grains.  Accessory apatite, as fine needles, is relatively common, but zircon is reported to be rare (Richards, 1981).  Minor myrmekite is also present in some xenoliths.  Plagioclase grains are commonly partly replaced by sericite and minor muscovite, and biotite flakes by chlorite.|
23948|Ruddygore Granodiorite|Relationships and boundaries|The granodiorite truncates the Chillagoe and Hodgkinson Formations, the Doolan Creek Rhyolite, the Redcap Dacite (Redcap Volcanics on the preliminary map), and Late Carboniferous units in the Featherbed Volcanics Group.  A knife-sharp intrusive contact between the Ruddygore Granodiorite and Jamtin Rhyolite (Featherbed Volcanic Group) is well exposed in the bed of Chillagoe Creek at Chillagoe.  Contacts between the granodiorite and the Early Permian Fisherman Rhyolite (Featherbed Volcanics Group) are faulted.  The granodiorite intrudes several unnamed stocks of mafic granodiorite or diorite (exposed mainly in the north) and is inferred to intrude the Almaden Granodiorite.  It is cut by the Bungabilly Granite, Pinchgut Granite, fine-grained porphyritic felsic intrusives of the Doolan Creek Ring Complex, by several unnamed stocks and dykes of aplite, leucogranite and leucoadamellite(?), by numerous rhyolite dykes, and by rare dykes and pods of dolerite (at least some of which is probably Cainozoic).  Small felsic intrusions are relatively common north and south of the Walsh River.|
23948|Ruddygore Granodiorite|Age reasons|The Ruddygore Granodiorite has yielded isotopic (Rb-Sr biotite) ages ranging between 301 Ma and 302 Ma (Richards, 1981).|
23948|Ruddygore Granodiorite|Comments|The Ruddygore Granodiorite closely resembles the Almaden Granodiorite and is one of the major units of the northern Tate batholith of Richards (1981).  According to Richards (1981) it is the most complex pluton in the batholith.|

24481|Rundle Formation|Lithology|A kerogen-rich sequence of claystone that has been informally subdivided into six kerogenous seams and a claystone unit. There are minor limestone and carbonaceous to coaly shale beds. All six oil shale seams contain varying amounts of interbedded claystone, but the unit is dominantly claystone. The oil shale ranges from dark yellowish-brown through moderate yellowish-brown to olive-grey. It is moderately hard, sectile, silty in part and ranges from massive to shaly. It is sporadically calcareous. The claystone is dominantly dark greenish-grey to greyish blue, green, massive, and ranges from soft (puggy) to moderately hard. It is calcareous in part.|
24481|Rundle Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Conformable with the informally named Worthington beds (below) and the Curlew Formation (above). The lower boundary of the Rundle Formation is the base of the lowermost oil shale bed in the type section. The upper boundary is gradational. The oil shale grades into carbonaceous oil shale over a stratigraphic interval up to 5 m thick at the base of a thick interbedded carbonaceous shale and grey claystone bed of the overlying Curlew Formation. The formation is faulted against Palaeozoic rocks (basement) at the western margin of The Narrows Graben.|

23953|Saint Giles Volcanics|Name source|The name is derived from the Parish of Saint Giles, County of Wilkie Gray.|
23953|Saint Giles Volcanics|Unit history|Rocks of the Saint Giles Volcanics were previously included in the "Unnamed Acid Volcanics" (Cuv) of Wyatt & others (1970). Curent mapping has assigned other parts of this unit to the Tareela Volcanics, Carboniferous to Permian intrusive rhyolites and the Watershed North Rhyolite|
23953|Saint Giles Volcanics|Type section locality|The type area is in the headwaters of the Little Star River upstream from 8159-247784 on the North Branch and 8159-271772 on the South Branch.  The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.|
23953|Saint Giles Volcanics|Description at type locality|Outcrop in this area consists of moderately crystal-rich to crystal-rich, moderately lithic-rich rhyolitic ignimbrite and tuff and minor slightly porphyritic rhyolite.|
23953|Saint Giles Volcanics|Extent|The Saint Giles Volcanics crop out along the Paluma Range from just north of Thornton Gap to Mount Halifax, about 27km to the north. The area also includes various plutons which have intruded the volcanic rocks. Scattered outcrop also occurs to the northwest, arcing across the upper reaches of the Star River.|
23953|Saint Giles Volcanics|Thickness range|The thickness of the Saint Giles Volcanics is very difficult to determine because of lack of information due to inaccessibility and dense rainforest cover. Dips measured in the headwaters of Little Star and Star Rivers suggest that the unit comprises moderately dipping sheets. This information and the fact that the unit crops out from near sea level to the top of the Paluma Range puts its thickness at over 1000m and possibly up to 3500 m.|
23953|Saint Giles Volcanics|Lithology|The Saint Giles Volcanics consist of grey to dark grey, crystal-poor to crystal-rich, lithic-poor to moderately lithic-rich dacitic to rhyolitic ignimbrite and minor lapilli breccia and flow-banded, spherulitic, slightly to moderately porphyritic rhyolite. The rhyolites are probably equivalent to some of the felsic intrusions which have been mapped throughout the area. Because of poor access and thick forest cover, boundaries of the felsic intrusions could not be delineated, and these rocks were included in the Saint Giles Volcanics.  The dominant rock type of this unit is a dacitic to rhyolitic ignimbrite. Crystal and lithic content covers a wide range. Given the diverse range of crystal, lithic and fiamme content the unit undoubtedly comprises different ignimbrite sheets. However, due to poor access and thick rainforest cover these sheets have not been delineated. Overall the Saint Giles Volcanics contain more lithics and less crystals than the Paluma Rhyolite.|07/FEB/11
23953|Saint Giles Volcanics|Relationships and boundaries|The Saint Giles Volcanics are intruded by numerous Carboniferous to Permian granite and rhyolite bodies including the Clemant Microgranite (337±6 Ma) and unnamed granite. They are faulted against and unconformably overlie Proterozoic and early Palaeozoic metamorphics and granitoids. Rocks in the Bog Hollow Pocket area may be equivalent to upper subunits of the Tareela Volcanics. Dips in the Blue Gum Creek area suggest that the unit is overlain by the Paluma Rhyolite.|
23953|Saint Giles Volcanics|Age reasons|The stratigraphic position and intrusive relationships of the Saint Giles Volcanics suggest an Early Carboniferous age.|

27230|Saint James Volcanics|Unit history|The name "Saint James Volcanics" was first used by Wyatt & others (1970).  The Saint James Volcanics were included in the Glenrock Group by Hutton & others (1994).|
27230|Saint James Volcanics|Constituents|Our mapping has subdivided the Saint James Volcanics into five unassigned units (Cs1, Cs2, Cs3, Cs4, Cs5) that crop out in the north-west corner of the Parish of Saint James.|
27230|Saint James Volcanics|Type section locality|Wyatt & others (1970) did not give a type section for the Saint James Volcanics. A type section is herein designated across the western limb of the syncline between 8159-253536 and 268540, and thence along a gully, which trends approximately in the same direction as the fold hinge, to its headwaters at the boundary with the Watershed Rhyolite at 282547.  The grid references are based on the AGD66 datum.|
27230|Saint James Volcanics|Description at type locality|From the base upwards the section consists of the following informal units: - about 50m of dark grey, mainly aphyric basalt (porphyritic at the base) (Cs1); - about 50m of coarse to pebbly, volcaniclastic sandstone (Cs2); - about 200m of cream, rhyolitic breccia (Cs3); - about 200m of dark grey, aphyric, amygdaloidal basalt and basaltic breccia (Cs4); - about 1000m of pale green, moderately crystal and lithic-rich rhyolitic ignimbrite, aphyric and spherulitic flow-banded rhyolite and dark green, crystal and lithic-rich rhyolitic lapilli breccia (Cs5).|07/FEB/11
27230|Saint James Volcanics|Extent|The two basaltic units, Cs1 and Cs4, are recessive forming low dark soil country, vegetated by good grass cover and narrow leaf ironbarks. The felsic units are more resistant, particularly the breccia unit (Cs3) which forms a low ridge along the western limb of the syncline. Vegetation cover is poor consisting of less grass than over the basic units and stunted, broad-leaf ironbarks.|
27230|Saint James Volcanics|Thickness range|The Saint James Volcanics are estimated to be approximately 1500m thick in the type section. The constituent units vary considerably in thickness along strike.|
27230|Saint James Volcanics|Lithology|Five informal units have been recognised in the Saint James Volcanics as described in the type section. The lowest unit Cs1 is composed of a dark grey, mainly aphyric basalt, that is locally porphyritic, particularly at the base.  Cs2 consists of grey to pale green coarse to pebbly volcaniclastic sandstone, chert and rhyolitic breccia. The volcaniclastic sandstone contains felsic volcanic pebbles which tend to be fissile and are commonly imbricated. Local very thin to thin internal bedding has been noted but overall bedding is thick to very thick.  Unit Cs3 is a cream to pale pink, rhyolitic breccia.   Cs4 comprises dark grey, aphyric to abundantly porphyritic basalt and basaltic autobreccia. The aphyric basalt is locally amydaloidal.  The uppermost unit (Cs5) consists predominantly of pale green to grey, moderately crystal-rich to crystal-rich and lithic-rich rhyolitic lapilli breccia and ignimbrite. Minor porphyritic, spherulitic, flow-banded rhyolite and felsic volcanic breccia are also present.|07/FEB/11
27230|Saint James Volcanics|Relationships and boundaries|On their western margin the Saint James Volcanics disconformably overlie the Devonian to Early Carboniferous Keelbottom Group. Along the eastern and southern margins the formation has been intruded by Carboniferous to Permian rhyolite, whereas to the north it is unconformably overlain by the Watershed Rhyolite of probable Carboniferous age.|
27230|Saint James Volcanics|Age reasons|Because of their stratigraphic position and lithological similarities to other known Early Carboniferous volcanics in the Townsville hinterland, the Saint James Volcanics have been assigned to the Early Carboniferous.|

24486|Saint Ronans Metamorphics|Name source|Named after Saint Ronans Creek whose tributaries drain much of the outcrop area in the Ardmore 1:100 000 Sheet area, Urandangi 1:250 000 Sheet area.|
24486|Saint Ronans Metamorphics|Unit history|Mapped as Eastern Creek Volcanics by Noakes & others (1959).|
24486|Saint Ronans Metamorphics|Type section locality|From GR 170860 to GR 209857, at the head of Saint Ronans Creek-Wet Branch, about 9.5-13 km W of Steeles Tank. In this area the unit consists mainly of extensively recrystallised felsic metavolcanics, fine-grained schistose metabasalt, fine-grained quartz + muscovite (or sericite) +/- biotite schist, and quartz + biotite + feldspar + muscovite gneiss. Minor rock types present include quartzite, epidotic quartzite, and quartzose and sericitic meta-arenite.|
24486|Saint Ronans Metamorphics|Extent|The metamorphics are most extensively exposed in the central part of the Ardmore 1:100 000 Sheet area, S and E of Ardmore homestead. A small outcrop in the far N of the sheet area has also been tentatively assigned to this unit. The metamorphics are confined to the area W of the Rufus Fault Zone, which forms part of a major right-lateral fracture system extending to the SW and NNE (the Gorge Creek-Mount Remarkable Fault of Derrick & others, 1980).|
24486|Saint Ronans Metamorphics|Lithology|The rocks are generally as in the type area. Locally andalusite porphyroblasts are common in the schistose meta-argillites. Minor rock types present elsewhere include biotite schist, quartz-biotite schist locally containing small scattered muscovite porphyroblasts, muscovite quartzite, para-amphibolite, chlorite schist, and schistose micaceous metasiltstone. Small-scale cross-beds and ripple laminations are preserved in some meta-arenite units. The Saint Ronans Metamorphics have a generally steeply dipping foliation trending mainly N to NW, more or less parallel to the lithological layering; small crenulations and kink bands are common, but few major folds have been positively identified. In the S, about 6 km NNW of Rufus Tank (GR 202786), foliation and rare bedding have easterly trends, dip generally steeply southwards, and are cut by a prominent N-trending cleavage.|
24486|Saint Ronans Metamorphics|Relationships and boundaries|The metamorphics are intruded by veins, pods, and larger bodies of granite and pegmatitic granite and by swarms of pegmatite dykes, interpreted as part of the Sybella Granite batholith. They are also cut by numerous non-schistose to schistose amphibolitic metadolerite dykes and ?sills, some of which are cut by granite and pegmatite veins. The relationship between the Saint Ronans Metamorphics and Oroopo Metabasalt is uncertain, due largely to poor exposures. The two formations appear concordant and no major break has been recognised between them. Cross-beds in a S-dipping meta-arenite unit in the Oroopo Metabasalt at GR 126763 indicate that the beds are right way up and younging southwards. Rare cross-beds in the Saint Ronans Metamorphics adjacent to the contact indicate that this sequence is also right way up, and underlies the Oroopo Metabasalt.|
24486|Saint Ronans Metamorphics|Age reasons|Precambrian, probably Proterozoic.|
24486|Saint Ronans Metamorphics|Proposed publication|R233|
24486|Saint Ronans Metamorphics|Comments|The general obliteration of bedding, the widespread development of schistose rocks, the presence of andalusite porphyroblasts in some meta-argillites, and the extensive recrystallisation of the felsic and mafic volcanic rocks are interpreted as indicating mainly upper greenschist to possible middle amphibolite grades of regional metamorphism. Metamorphic grade appears to decrease to the south.|

There the unit is a well foliated biotite granodiorite containing biotite rich bands about 1 cm wide and over 5 m long, as well as wider (about 10 cm) more leucocratic layers and streaks; discordant leucocratic veins cut across the layering and the abundant xenoliths of gneiss. Tight folds which deform the foliation in the xenoliths also deform the layering in the granodiorite and the discordant veins. Outcrops of grey biotite granodiorite containing abundant xenoliths of calc-silicate gneiss at GR 073 686 in the Gilbert River can be regarded as a reference locality.|
24488|Sawpit Granodiorite|Extent|Crops out over an area of about 15 km2 in two main areas; one is centred near the junction of Sawpit and Christmas Hill (or Duffer) Creeks (grid square 0975) and the other extends for about a kilometre upstream along the Gilbert River from its junction with Sawpit Creek.|
24488|Sawpit Granodiorite|Lithology|Grey equigranular, medium grained, foliated biotite granodiorite, tonalite and quartz diorite. Commonly banded as well as foliated, as described at the type locality. Enclaves of Einasleigh Metamorphics ranging from a few centimetres to hundreds of metres are common.|
24488|Sawpit Granodiorite|Relationships and boundaries|Intrudes the Proterozoic Einasleigh Metamorphics. Intruded by white leucogranite equated with the Anning Granite and muscovite granite equated with the Digger Creek Granite, as well as ring dykes and cone sheets which form part of the Carboniferous Bagstowe Ring Dyke Complex.|
24488|Sawpit Granodiorite|Age reasons|Mid-Proterozoic; strongly foliated and deformed during the second major deformation in the area which has been dated at about 1470 m.y. (Black & others, 1979).|

26324|Saxby Granite|Unit history|Like all other granites in the eastern part of the Duchess 1:250 000 Sheet area, the Saxby Granite was mapped as part of the Williams Granite by Carter & Opik (1963).|
26324|Saxby Granite|Type section locality|Vicinity of Saxby Waterholes on the Williams River, GR 789691, Mount Angelay 1:100 000 Sheet area, Duchess 1:250 000 Sheet area. Here there are extensive exposures - rocky hills, tors and spheroidal boulders - of pink, medium to coarse, porphyritic biotite granite.|
26324|Saxby Granite|Extent|The main outcrops of this unit are in the northern part of Mount Angelay 1:100 000 Sheet area, mainly in the catchment area of the Williams River east of the Cloncurry Fault, where they cover a total area of about 180 km2. The unit is also taken to include small outcrops of petrographically similar granite east of the Cloncurry Faualt to the south, between the Fullarton River and Boorama Creek, Mount Angelay 1:100 000 Sheet area, Duchess 1:250 000 Sheet area.|
26324|Saxby Granite|Lithology|The unit consists mainly of medium to coarse, porphyritic and even-grained granite containing biotite and/or hornblende (and clinopyroxene near contacts with calc-silicate rocks). It also includes minor leucogranite, granodiorite, diorite, monzonite, aplite and pegmatite.|
26324|Saxby Granite|Relationships and boundaries|Saxby Granite intrudes the Soldiers Cap Group and Doherty Formation, and is cut by E-trending dolerite dykes. It is overlain unconformably by Mesozoic sediments.|

26324|Saxby Granite|Comments|The granite forms a group of closely spaced intrusives separated geographically from other named granites in the area by the Cloncurry Fault zone. It forms part of the Williams Batholith (new structural term), and is probably related to the petrographically similar Mount Angelay Granite and Squirarel Hills Granite.|

22830|Sentinel Range Igneous Complex|Name source|The unit forms the northern part of the Sentinel Range, a series of northwesterly-trending low hills ~12 - 23 km northwest of Chillagoe.|
22830|Sentinel Range Igneous Complex|Unit history|The complex was previously mapped as Elizabeth Creek Granite (Best, 1962;  de Keyser & Wolff, 1964).|
22830|Sentinel Range Igneous Complex|Geomorphic expression|The unit forms bouldery hilly terrain which has pale to medium tones on aerial photographs.|
22830|Sentinel Range Igneous Complex|Type section locality|The proposed type area is from ~GR 2180 81172 to ~GR 2297 81173.  Most of the variants are exposed in this area.  The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.|
22830|Sentinel Range Igneous Complex|Extent|The complex crops out as an elongate, northwest-trending body of ~2 km2, extending 4 - 7 km northwest of the abandoned mining centre of Mungana.|
22830|Sentinel Range Igneous Complex|General description|ALTERATION: The micro-adamellite has been extensively altered locally (e.g., south of Red Hill) and epidote/clinozoisite is common along joints.  MINBERALISATION: No mineralisation was observed, apart from traces of pyrite or altered pyrite(?).  The complex may have been responsible for the metasomatic, skarn-type, Cu-Sn mineralisation in the calcareous sediments of the adjacent Chillagoe Formation at Red Hill.  The mineralised rocks consist mainly of magnetite/hematite/jarosite, chalcedony and vuggy quartz.  Banding is commonly well developed and quartz grains show comb structures indicating that they grew in open spaces.  Chalcedony pseudomorph after zoned garnet megacrysts are present locally, but the relict structures and textures are generally poorly preserved adjacent to the complex.  The host rocks, probably mainly magnetite-garnet-diopside skarn, appear to have been extensively brecciated.  The brecciation may have been produced by supergene weatherin.|07/FEB/11
22830|Sentinel Range Igneous Complex|Lithology|The complex consists of white to pale pink porphyritic micro-adamellite, even-grained to porphyritic quartz diorite, heterogeneous hybrid rocks, and minor medium to coarse-grained porphyritic adamellite, aplite, and pegmatite.  The felsic granitic rocks which make up most of the complex show considerable textural and compositional variation.  Euhedral to subhedral phenocrysts make up to ~40% of the porphyritic/micro-adamellite.  They consist of quartz, plagioclase, K-feldspar, and minor biotite, hornblende, allanite, opaque oxide, and zircon.  Quartz and feldspar phenocrysts tend to form glomeroporphyritic aggregates.  Quartz phenocrysts are up to 6 mm across.  They show slightly undulose extinction and some have embayed margins.  Plagioclase is generally the most abundant phenocryst present.  The laths, up to 6 mm long, commonly show well-developed compositional zoning.  Cores contain inclusions of hornblende, biotite and quartz, and cloudy zones or patches due to incipient preferential alteration.  Some grains are partly replaced by sericite but the degree of alteration is generally only slight.  K-feldspar phenocrysts are up to 12 mm long and appear mainly unaltered.  Some of the larger grains contain inclusions of plagioclase and show slight zoning.  Biotite makes up to ~5% of the micro-adamellite, but is irregularly distributed throughout the felsic rocks of the complex.  Hornblende forms euhedral to subhedral grains, up to about 0.5 mm across, and small aggregates of subhedral to anhedral grains.  It is generally subordinate to biotite and is absent in some specimens. Accessory minerals are mainly opaque oxide, allanite, and zircon.  More felsic, microgranitic variants in the complex contain few (<5%) or no phenocrysts and tend to be concentrated in marginal zones.  The mafic rocks occur as small pods and also as irregular, angular to rounded fragments, ranging from <2 cm to 1 m across, enclosed in and veined by adamellite.|07/FEB/11
22830|Sentinel Range Igneous Complex|Relationships and boundaries|The complex intrudes the Chillagoe Formation and Dargalong Metamorphics.  It also truncates the Palmerville Fault.|
22830|Sentinel Range Igneous Complex|Age reasons|The unit is Late Carboniferous.  Biotite from a sample of porphyritic micro-adamellite has yielded an isotopic age of 303 ± 2 Ma using the K-Ar method (Amdel report GS 4840/83).|
22830|Sentinel Range Igneous Complex|Comments|The striking textural and compositional variations shown by the rocks of the complex appear to have resulted mainly from the mingling of mafic and felsic magmas.  Much of the complex consists of porphyritic micro-adamellite with a very fine-grained groundmass and microgranophyric intergrowths, implying emplacement at relatively high levels in the crust.  The age of the complex indicates that the last major movement on the Palmerville Fault in the Mungana area must have taken place before the Late Carboniferous.|

16787|Shady Bore Quartzite|Name source|Shady Bore on the Thornton River, 10 km northeast of Thorntonia at 947460 in the Mount Oxide 1:100 000 Sheet area.|
16787|Shady Bore Quartzite|Unit history|The rocks now defined as Shady Bore Quartzite were previously included in the Ploughed Mountain Beds in the north, in the Pilpah Sandstone in the southwest, and in other areas in the Paradise Creek Formation by Carter & others (1961). Cavaney (1975) originally named this unit the "Carrier Quartzite" but this name was invalid due to prior usage.|
16787|Shady Bore Quartzite|Type section locality|Holostratotype: Along the south bank of a creek adjacent to the track from Thorntonia to Shady Bore from 911439 (base) to 906439 (top) in the Mount Oxide 1:100 000 Sheet area. The section comprises 250 m of massive, medium grained white orthoquartzite with poorly outcropping interbeds of friable sandstone, siltstone and dolomite.|
16787|Shady Bore Quartzite|Extent|Best exposed as broadly folded outcrops in the Lawn Hill and Riversleigh Sheet areas, as a narrow band along the boundary between the Riversleigh and Mount Oxide and Undilla and Mammoth Mines sheet areas, and in the Yelvertoft and Kennedy Gap Sheet areas.|
16787|Shady Bore Quartzite|Thickness range|The unit is 250 m thick in the holostratotype. Elsewhere, the thickness varies from a maximum of 500 m in the centre of the Riversleigh 1:100 000 Sheet area and in the southwest of the Kennedy Gap 1:100 000 Sheet area to a minimum of 50 m on the Riversleigh Sheet area.|
16787|Shady Bore Quartzite|Lithology|White, flaggy to massive medium grained white orthoquartzite, with siltstone and dolomite interbeds. It varies along strike depending on the number of massive orthoquartzite beds present.|
16787|Shady Bore Quartzite|Relationships and boundaries|The unit conformably overlies the Lady Loretta Formation and is conformably overlain by the Riversleigh Siltstone. The basal contact is gradational and is placed where orthoquartzite beds make up more than 25 percent of the sequence. The upper contact is placed at the top of the uppermost massive orthoquartzite bed.|

27653|Shield Creek Formation|Name source|Shield Creek, the name for the upper reaches of Gray Creek   also Shield Creek Holding (Clarke River 1.250 000 Cadastral map).|
27653|Shield Creek Formation|Unit history|The unit was originally mapped as part of the Broken River Formation (White, 1959, 1962, 1965).  Wyatt & Jell (1980), separated the unit from the Broken River Formation, but did not formally define it.|
27653|Shield Creek Formation|Geomorphic expression|The unit generally forms low to recessive topography, but locally slightly more elevated than the adjacent units.  It has a light tone on the airphotos due to the abundant feldspathic arenite, and supports a low cover of quinine bush and locally spinifex.|
27653|Shield Creek Formation|Type section locality|.  A composite section is designated. The basal part is in a small tributary of Turtle Creek from 7859 702665 (base) to 694661 (base of Martins Well Limestone Member).   The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum|19/MAR/08
27653|Shield Creek Formation|Description at type locality|The basal part consists of 300 m of generally coarse-grained feldspathic arenite with minor fine-grained silty arenite, siltstone and mudstone.    The middle part is the type section of the Martins Well Limestone Member, between 7859 682684 (base) and 683683 (top), and consists of 85 m of bioclastic calcarenite with thin shale interbeds, as originally defined by Jell (1968).   The top part is in a gully between 7859-680640 (top of the member) to 679635 (base of Dip Creek Limestone) in which about 450 m of mainly feldspathic arenite, locally calcareous crops out.  The grid references ares based on the AGD66 datum.|19/MAR/08
27653|Shield Creek Formation|Extent|The unit crops out as a continuous folded belt from near 'Pandanus Creek' to the head of Magpie Creek, north of the large laterite plateau in central BURGES.  It extends from the southern edge of the plateau to Dosey Creek and in several synclinal cores between Storm Dam and the Broken River.|
27653|Shield Creek Formation|Thickness range|The unit is up to 900 m in the Martins Well area, but it is locally thin to absent as along the Broken River where it is only 20 m thick.|
27653|Shield Creek Formation|Lithology|Feldspathic sandstone, conglomerate, and limestone. Minor siltstone and mudstone. Thick to very thick bedded, with local medium scale, trough cross bedding.|
27653|Shield Creek Formation|Fossils|A rich fauna of corals (tabulate and rugose) as well as crinoids, sponges, brachiopods, and nautiloids occurs in the limestone members.  Brachiopods and trilobites occur in the siliciclastics.  Conodonts occur in the limestone members.|
27653|Shield Creek Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The Shield Creek Formation disconformably(?) overlies the Jack and Quinton Formations, and is disconformably(?) overlain by the Broken River Group. It is  distinguished from all these units by consisting predominantly of coarse-grained feldspathic arenite.  The boundary is usually poorly exposed, but in the Broken River at 7859-612441, it appears to be gradational with mudstone of the Bracteata Mudstone.    The unit contains the Martins Well Limestone Member, which was originally defined by Jell (1968) as part of the Broken River Formation, and also a new member near Jessey Springs, the Arch Creek Limestone Member, which is equivalent in age to the Martins Well Limestone Member.|
27653|Shield Creek Formation|Age reasons|A rich fauna of corals (tabulate and rugose) as well as crinoids, sponges, brachiopods, and nautiloids occurs in the limestone members.  Brachiopods and trilobites occur in the siliciclastics.  Conodonts in the limestone members indicate a Lochkovian to Pragian age (Telford, 1975;  Mawson & Talent, unpublished data), but the upper siliciclastics could extend into the Emsian.  See Withnall & others (1988) for more details.|
27653|Shield Creek Formation|Comments|With the raising of the Broken River Formation to group status, we have considered reinstating the Shield Creek Formation as part of the Broken River Group.  An alternative is to include it in the underlying Graveyard Creek Group.  However, the units may be separated by significant disconformities.  Conodont studies indicate a significant hiatus represented by three to four conodont zones in the Pragian and early Emsian between the limestone in the Shield Creek Formation and the lowermost carbonates of the Broken River Group (Mawson & Talent, unpublished data; Withnall & others, 1988).  It is worth noting, however, that this break is represented, at least in part, by a palaeontologically barren siliciclastic sequence, which in some places appears to have a gradational contact with the Broken River Group.  Lithologically and sedimentologically, the Shield Creek Formation possibly has more in common with the siliciclastic parts of the underlying Jack Formation of the Graveyard Creek Group, except for being predominantly feldspathic rather than quartzose.  However, conodonts indicate that a hiatus in the mid Lochkovian (again represented at least partly by a siliciclastic interval) also occurs between the Shield Creek Formation and the Jack Formation.  The hiatus was possibly of shorter duration (two to three zones), but may have been more significant tectonically.  On the time-scale of Harland & others (1982), it corresponds with widespread resetting of isotopic ages in the adjacent Georgetown Province at about 400 Ma, which may correspond with granitoid emplacement and uplift, and a corresponding lowering of relative sea-level, before the extensive transgression.  The flood of feldspathic sand may reflect such uplift of the plutonic and high-grade metamorphic rocks in the Georgetown and Lolworth-Ravenswood Provinces.Therefore, because of the uncertain relationships with the adjacent units, and its possible tectonic significance, the Shield Creek Formation is not included in either of the Groups which bound it.|

26144|Soldiers Cap Group|Name source|Soldiers Cap is a mesa capped with flat-lying Mesozoic sediments, 40 km southeast of Cloncurry, latitude 20o59'35"S, longitude 140o44'15"E (7056 727786).|
26144|Soldiers Cap Group|Constituents|Llewellyn Creek Formation, Mount Norna Quartzite and Toole Creek Volcanics. The Group was previously defined as the Soldiers Cap Formation (Carter et al., 1961).|
26144|Soldiers Cap Group|Geomorphic expression|The Group is expressed as rugged ridges in the central part, near Mount Norna and Soldiers Cap, and the topography becomes more mature with rounded hills of lower relief to the north, south and east.|
26144|Soldiers Cap Group|Type section locality|The type section of the Soldiers Cap Formation as defined by Carter et al. (1961) is approximately 11.5 km long and extends from latitude 20o56'40"S, longitude 140o39'50"E (7056 651842) to latitude 20o53'40"S, longitude 140o45'30"E (7056 750895). The type section of the constituent formations in the Group have been defined along this section.|
26144|Soldiers Cap Group|Extent|The Soldiers Cap Group has a total outcrop area of 2000 km2. Its distribution is essentially the same as that of the Soldiers Cap Formation as shown on the Cloncurry and Duchess 4-mile Geological Sheets (Carter et al., 1961). It occurs in the Cloncurry, Mount Angelay and Selwyn 1:100 000 Sheet areas.|
26144|Soldiers Cap Group|Thickness range|The Group is at least 6000 m thick and in some sections it lmay be more than 7500 m thick.|
26144|Soldiers Cap Group|Lithology|Phyllite, pelitic schist, metagreywacke, metasiltstone, lmetasandstone, metabasalt, amphibolite, chert, jaspilite, and calcareous shale.|
26144|Soldiers Cap Group|Relationships and boundaries|The base of the Soldiers Cap Group is not exposed; the Group is overlain unconformably by the Mary Kathleen Group (mainly the Corella Formation). Correlations with other Groups to the west are indirect; basalts in the Toole Creek Volcanics, Marraba Volcanics and Eastern Creek Volcanics are thought to represent contemporaneous basic volcanicity over a large area of the Cloncurry Complex. On this basis, the Soldiers Cap Group is broadly equivalent to the Malbon Group (Derrick et al., 1976d) and the Haslingden Group (Derrick et al., 1976b). Since the Toole Creek Volcanics appear to be equivalent to all of the Malbon Group, it follows that the Mount Norna Quartzite and Llewellyn Creek Formation may be time equivalent to the Argylla Formation (part of the Tewinga Group), which underlies the Malbon Group. This implies a facies change from a mainly acid volcanic-sandstone sequence in the west to a siltstone-sandstone sequence in the east. Alternatively, the Tewinga Group may be older than all of the Soldiers Cap Group.|11/JUN/08
26144|Soldiers Cap Group|Age reasons|Precambrian, probably Carpentarian to possibly Lower Proterozoic. McDougall et al. (1965) dated the Ewen Granite at 1780+/-20 m.y., and Carter et al. (1961) stated that the Ewen Granite is intrusive into the Argylla Formation. A minimum age of about 1780 m.y. is thus indicated for the Argylla Formation. Since the ARgylla Formation underlies or is equivalent to the lower part of the Soldiers Cap Group, a maximum age of the latter is also about 1780 m.y.|

24498|Sonoma Member|Type section locality|272.2 m (estimated true thickness 269.6 m) from 14 m to 286.2 m in LDD7 (GR 65665E, 97292N Miriam Vale 1:100 000 Sheet area). The interval is located within the type section of the Lowmead Formation. Claystone is the dominant rock type with interbedded kerogenous carbonaceous shale (carbonaceous oil shale) and kerogenous claystone (oil shale). There is minor sandstone and sandy claystone. Beds within the member range in thickness from 0.2 m to 20 m. The upper boundary of the member is an unconformity with unconsolidated Quaternary sediment. The lower boundary is defined at the contact between oil shale of the Sonoma Member and carbonaceous oil shale of the Makowata Oil Shale Member. |
24498|Sonoma Member|Description at type locality|Rock Types: Claystone beds are olive grey, moderately hard, massive and in part sandy and weakly kerogenous. Carbonaceous oil shale is brownish-black, moderately hard to hard and thinly bedded. Fragmentary plant remains are abundant. Oil shale is dusky yellow brown, hard and laminated. It is diffusely to strongly carbonaceous in part. Sandstone is dominantly fine to medium grained, with sand grains which are well sorted, sub-rounded, of moderate sphericity and friable. It contains dominantly (over 80%) quartz in a clay matrix.|

17149|Speed Creek Granite|Name source|Name derived from Speed Creek.|
17149|Speed Creek Granite|Unit history|Wyatt & others (1970) described these rocks as granodiorites and assigned them to two unnamed units, C-Pg and C-Pb. Our mapping has assigned them to one unit and found that they are dominantly granite.|
17149|Speed Creek Granite|Geomorphic expression|The unit forms recessive, low lying topography broken by prominent bouldery outcrops and tors|
17149|Speed Creek Granite|Type section locality|The type locality (8159-367513) is 800m north of the Hervey Range Road beside the track to the Ben Lomond uranium deposit.  The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.|
17149|Speed Creek Granite|Description at type locality|Outcrop consists of cream, medium to coarse-grained equigranular biotite granite that contains minor hornblende.|
17149|Speed Creek Granite|Extent|The Speed Creek Granite crops out as an irregularly shaped body trending north-east over an area of approximately 75km2. Outcrop area is largely along Speed Creek and its tributaries. Speed Creek is a tributary of Keelbottom Creek. Small areas of outcrop (0.3-2km2) also occur in the headwaters of Black Creek.|
17149|Speed Creek Granite|Lithology|Speed Creek Granite is a cream to grey, fine to coarse-grained, predominantly equigranular hornblende-biotite granite.  It is locally slightly porphyritic.  Near Thorntons Gap at 8159-43178612, the granite has been foliated or sheared. Locally, the Speed Creek Granite contains abundant, subrounded to rounded xenoliths of diorite up to 15cm across.|
17149|Speed Creek Granite|Relationships and boundaries|The Speed Creek Granite intrudes the Proterozoic(?) Argentine Metamorphics, Devonian sedimentary rocks of the Burdekin Basin, and Early Carboniferous Watershed North Rhyolite and Saint Giles Volcanics. A belt of hornfelsed sedimentary rocks surrounded largely by the granite is most probably Late Devonian Julia Formation. The unit has been intruded by Mingoom Granite, mafic and felsic high-level unnamed intrusive rocks, and an unnamed granite complex.|
17149|Speed Creek Granite|Age reasons|Webb (1969) determined a K-Ar around biotite and hornblende age of 284-296 Ma for the Speed Creek Granite, which is close to Carboniferous-Permian boundary. An Early Permian U-Pb zircon (SHRIMP) age of 283±4 Ma on a sample from the Speed Creek Granite is reported in Appendix 1.|

24501|Squirrel Hills Granite|Type section locality|Granite hills 0.8 km ESE of Squirrel Hills homestead, at GR 770915, Selwyn 1:100 000 Sheet area. Spheroidal bouldery exposures here are of medium-grained pinkish granite, most of which contains abundant feldspar phenocrysts, some more than 2 cm across.|
24501|Squirrel Hills Granite|Extent|The unit has an outcrop area about 100 km long and up to 25 km wide extending NNW across Selwyn, SW part of Mount Angelay and SE part of Malbon 1:100 000 Sheet areas, Duchess 1:250 000 Sheet area.|
24501|Squirrel Hills Granite|Lithology|The unit consists of massive, mainly pink, medium to coarse-grained, porphyritic and subordinate non-porphyritic granite, minor porphyritic microgranite and aplite, and rare pegmatite. The granite typically contains 5 to 15 percent biotite and/or hornblende and/or clinopyroxene and 2 percent or more of sphene and magnetite.|
24501|Squirrel Hills Granite|Relationships and boundaries|Squirrel Hills Granite intrudes the Soldiers Cap Group, Corella Formation, Kuridala Formation, and metadolerite, and is also inferred to intrude Cowie Granite. It is cut by E-trending dolerite dykes and is overlain by flat-lying Mesozoic sediments.|
24501|Squirrel Hills Granite|Age reasons|Proterozoic|
24501|Squirrel Hills Granite|Proposed publication|Blake & others, in prep. - see References|
24501|Squirrel Hills Granite|Comments|Remarks: The granite forms a large, well-defined and probably composite body. It is probably closely related to the petrographically similar Wimberu, Mount Dore, Mount Cobalt, Yellow Waterhole, Mount Angelay, and Saxby Granites (new names), from which it is separated geographically, and forms part of the Williams Batholith (new structural term).|

17306|Staveley Formation|Name source|Named after the Parish of Staveley, in which much of the outcrop area of the formation lies, in the Duchess 1:250 000 Sheet area.|
17306|Staveley Formation|Unit history|The Staveley Formation, as defined here, is similar to the Staveley Formation of Carter & others except that it is more extensive in outcrop, does not include the Agate Downs Siltstone, and may overlie, rather than be overlain by, the Kuridala Formation.|
17306|Staveley Formation|Type section locality|The type section given by Carter & others (1961) extends from a point 1.6 km north of the Tip-top mine (from GR 434234) west for a distance of about 6.4 km, Malbon 1:100 000 Sheet area, Duchess 1:250 000 Sheet area. However the western part of this type section is the type section for the Agate Downs Siltstone, now defined as a formation rather than as a member of the Staveley Formation. The type section has therefore been revised to extend from GR 434324 (1.6 km north of the Tip-top mine) west for 4.6 km (to GR 388324). From east to west this section passes across strike from a contact with ridge-forming schist of the Kuridala Formation in the east through the following map units - Pks of the Staveley Formation, 100 m; Pksbr of the Staveley Formation, 450 m; Pks, 600 m; alluvium, 400 m; Pks, 600 m; metadolerite, 700 m; Pks, 400 m; ridge-forming siltstone and slate mapped as Kuridala Formation, 250 m; Pks, 150 m; Pksbr, 400 m; metadolerite, 200 m; and Pksbr, 500 m; to ridge-forming Agate Downs Siltstone. Unit Pks forms gently undulating terrain and consists of interbedded, variably calcareous, ferruginous, feldspathic, micaceous and siliceous fine-grained sandstone, siltstone, and phyllite, and impure limestone, which are mainly shades of grey, brown, or red-brown. Unit Pksbr is more upstanding and commonly forms bouldery exposures; it consists of breccia formed of mainly angular fragments of Pks rocks enclosed in a sandy to silty matrix which is generally calcareous and ferruginous.|
17306|Staveley Formation|Extent|As mapped by Blake & others (in prep. b) and Donchak & others (in prep.), the Staveley Formation crops out in a belt up to 14 km wide extending from 2 km north of Gin Creek Bore (from GR 380018, Mount Merlin 1:100 000 Sheet area) northwards for at least 75 km, to the northern edge of the Malbon and Mount Angelay 1:100 000 Sheet areas, Duchess 1:250 000 Sheet area. This belt contains most of the outcrops mapped as Staveley Formation by Carter & others (1961) and Carter & Opik (1963), and also includes outcrops in the north which they ;mapped as Corella Formation.|
17306|Staveley Formation|Thickness range|The formation  may have a maximum thickness of more than 2000 m, but this is uncertain because of tight to isoclinal folding.|
17306|Staveley Formation|Lithology|The formation consists of interbedded, variably calcareous, ferruginous, feldspathic, micaceous, and siliceous sandstone, siltstone, and phyllite, impure limestone (marble), and lenses of breccia, as exposed in the type section, together with schist and banded calc-silicate rocks (mainly near granite), and minor basalt lava, conglomerate, and banded quartz + hematite +/- magnetite rock. Sedimentary structures commonly present, in many cases outlined by heavy mineral laminae, include convolute to recumbent bedding, cross-bedding, graded bedding, and ripple marks; halite casts are present locally.|
17306|Staveley Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The Staveley Formation has concordant contacts with Kuridala Formation, Answer Slate, and Overhang Jaspilite, which it may overlie disconformably, and with Agate Downs Siltstone, Marimo Slate, Roxmere Quartzite, Mick Creek Sandstone, and Toby Barty Sandstone, which overlie it, apparently conformably. The Agate Downs Siltstone and part of the Marimo Slate may be stratigraphic equivalents of part of the Staveley Formation. The formation is faulted against Double Crossing Metamorphics in the south and against Doherty Formation in the north. It is intruded by Gin Creek Granite, Wimberu Granite, Squirrel Hills Granite, unnamed granite, metadolerite, and feldspar porphyry, and overlain unconformably by flat-lying Mesozoic sediments.|

17306|Staveley Formation|Proposed publication|Blake & others, in prep. a  - see References|
17306|Staveley Formation|Comments|Revision of the definition originally proposed by Carter & others (1961).Remarks: Blake & others (in prep. B) and Donchak & others (in prep.) regard the Staveley Formation as part of the Marimo Slate sequence, which may have been laid down unconformably in the north on cherty and ferruginous breccia, representing a fossil regolith, mapped as part of the Overhang Jaspilite. To the south the formation possibly overlaps onto Answer Slate; the contact could be a low-angle unconformity rendered apparently concordant by subsequent isoclinal folding.|

17326|Stevenson Quartz Monzodiorite|Extent|An equant body 90 km2 in area, south of the Theresa Creek Dam, between the Iron Hut Quartz Monzonite to the north and the Kilmarnock Granodiorite and Annmore Quartz Monzodiorite to the south.|
17326|Stevenson Quartz Monzodiorite|Lithology|Dark to light grey, fine to coarse-grained, and equigranular to subequigranular, ranging from biotite-hornblende quartz monzonite to biotite-hornblende quartz diorite.|
17326|Stevenson Quartz Monzodiorite|Relationships and boundaries|Intrudes the Anakie Metamorphic Group and is unconformably overlain by the Late Devonian to Early Carboniferous Silver Hills Volcanics. The relationship with Kilmarnock Granodiorite and Iron Hut Quartz Monzonite is unknown.|
17326|Stevenson Quartz Monzodiorite|Age reasons|Webb & McDougall (1968) obtained a K-Ar biotite age corrected to 379 Ma. An age of 382 Ma has been obtained from Rb-Sr dating of a biotite-whole rock pair (P. Carr, unpublished data). The age is therefore probably Middle Devonian.|

29023|Stopem Blockem Conglomerate Member|Unit history|The member was previously mapped as part of the Bundock Creek Formation (now Group) (White, 1959, 1962, 1965).  The name was first published and described by Withnall & others (1988), but was not formally defined.|
29023|Stopem Blockem Conglomerate Member|Geomorphic expression|The member forms a range of steep hills with relief of about 100 m, and locally known as the Red Range, between Pages Creek and Gorge Creek.  It has a distinctive dark brown tone on aerial photographs, and is easily photo-interpreted even where it is not so topographically prominent.|
29023|Stopem Blockem Conglomerate Member|Type section locality|Red Range Gorge on the Broken River from 7859 559448 (base) to 558449(top).  The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.|
29023|Stopem Blockem Conglomerate Member|Description at type locality|The member consists of 239 m of reddish grey to purple sandstone and conglomerate, with interbedded siltstone and grey sandstone.  See Withnall & others (1988, figure 53 and page 85) and Lang (1985, 1986a) for more details.|
29023|Stopem Blockem Conglomerate Member|Extent|A narrow belt about 35 km long from near Pages Creek at 7858 508402 around the Rockfields Syncline to 7859 589547 near the hinge of the Atherton Anticlinorium.|
29023|Stopem Blockem Conglomerate Member|Thickness range|Up to 300 m between the south branch of Gorge Creek and the Pandanus Creek-Jessie Springs track.  Progressively thins on the northwestern limb of the Rockfields Syncline, and lenses out near the hinge of the Atherton Creek Anticlinorium.|
29023|Stopem Blockem Conglomerate Member|Lithology|Greyish red to purple lithic sandstone, polymictic conglomerate, and minor fine-grained redbeds; local calcirudite.  Pebbly sandstone is predominant over conglomerate, but the latter is distinctive and contains clasts of red jasper, and reddish brown quartzose arenite and siltstone.  The sandstone and conglomerate contain trough and low-angle trough and tabular cross-beds, ripple cross laminae, rip-up clasts, erosive structures with pebble lags, pebble imbrication, and horizontal planar laminae.|
29023|Stopem Blockem Conglomerate Member|Fossils|The only fossils are moulds and casts of Leptophloeum australe and indeterminate root casts.|
29023|Stopem Blockem Conglomerate Member|Relationships and boundaries|A member of the Bulgeri Formation. The base is marked by the first reddish purple polymictic conglomerate above the base of the Bulgeri Formation.  Northeast of the north branch of Gorge Creek, the member lies directly on the Rockfields Member, but to the southwest the members are up to 200 m apart.  The unit is overlain by normal drab sandstone and conglomerate.  Other reddish purple conglomerates do occur above the member, but these are presently unnamed.|
29023|Stopem Blockem Conglomerate Member|Age reasons|The unit is probably Frasnian or Famennian in age based on its stratigraphic position.|

REFERENCE SECTION::  In the north arm of Papilio Creek between 567400 (anticlinal hinge) and 566401 (boundary with the overlying relatively thin Dosey Limestone), consisting of about 100 m of coarse to very coarse quartzose to feldspathic sandstone.|
17386|Storm Hill Sandstone|Description at type locality|About 50 m of coarse to very coarse quartzose sandstone and oligomictic pebble conglomerate is exposed.|
17386|Storm Hill Sandstone|Extent|Intricately folded with other units of the Broken River Group, south of the Broken River.  The thickest development is in the southwest, particularly to the north and west of Storm Dam.  It lenses out north of Lomandra Creek.|
17386|Storm Hill Sandstone|Thickness range|Up to 100 m at least.  It may be thicker in the area north and west of Storm Hill, but folding there prevents an accurate determination of thickness.|
17386|Storm Hill Sandstone|Lithology|Coarse to very coarse-grained quartzose to feldspathic sandstone and lesser oligomictic conglomerate.|
17386|Storm Hill Sandstone|Fossils|The unit is generally unfossiliferous, but poorly preserved corals, crinoids, brachiopods, and bivalves occur in a few places.|
17386|Storm Hill Sandstone|Relationships and boundaries|The unit is part of the Wando Vale Subgroup of the Broken River Group.  It conformably overlies the Lomandra Limestone and is conformably overlain by the Dosey Limestone in much of its outcrop area, but lenses out to the northeast and east.  East of Storm Hill, the limestones lens out and the Storm Hill Sandstone directly overlies the Bracteata Mudstone and is overlain by the Papilio Mudstone.  At Storm Hill it directly overlies the Jack Formation, and to the northwest it unconformably overlies the Judea Formation.  In the northwest near the Broken River, it passes laterally into the Burges Formation.|
17386|Storm Hill Sandstone|Age reasons|The age inferred from stratigraphic relationships is Emsian to late Eifelian.|

33432|Stuart River Granite|Extent|The unit forms a north-north-west trending teardrop shaped pluton 15km in length and up to 4km wide, located about 18km due west of the township of Wondai.|30/NOV/09
33432|Stuart River Granite|Lithology|The granite is fine to medium (or rarely coarse) grained and cream in colour, with local areas of metasomatic? pinkening (of matrix feldspar) being common throughout the pluton. The granite is equigranular and leucocratic with the mafic minerals (fine biotite as scattered clots) making up only around 1% of the rock, associated with relatively coarse accessory sphene grains. Accessory opaques are very low or absent from the rock, which is consistent with its low magnetic response on geophysical images. In thin section, the granite is commonly extensively recrystallised with scattered anhedral, mainly alkali feldspar grains and aggregates surrounded by anastomosing zones of strained, dynamically recrystallised, finer grained quartz aggregates. The southernmost part of the granite (subunit PRgtf), is relatively homogeneously fine grained, leucocratic, and penetratively foliated.The western contact with the Fifer Creek Metamorphics is characterised by numerous quartz blows and silica flooding of the meta-sediments.|30/NOV/09
33432|Stuart River Granite|Relationships and boundaries|The unit intrudes the Fifer Creek Metamorphics and is intruded by a small granite body mapped as unit Rg2. The relationship with surrounding intrusive units (unit Rg5, the Melrose Igneous Complex and the Hivesville Granite) is unknown although the regular geometry of the pluton suggests that it may have intruded these units.  The granite is intruded by aplite and rhyolite dykes of unknown age.|30/NOV/09
33432|Stuart River Granite|Structure and Metamorphism|DEFORMATION::  The granite is commonly cut by networks of anastomosing mylonitic shears and brittle fractures, which account for the widespread partial recrystallisation throughout the pluton.  In a few places, (especially in subunit PRgtf) biotite alignment defines a penetrative, steeply dipping, north-west to north-north-west trending foliation visible at outcrop scale. At one locality (AMG 366351 7084851) a north-west plunging down-dip lineation is visible. The most intensely deformed rocks appear to be in the south where the granite contains mylonitic meta-sedimentary rafts of country rock, and within the more intensely foliated PRgtf subunit.|
33432|Stuart River Granite|Age reasons|No age dating of the pluton has been carried out. The unit is thought to be in the Permian to Triassic age range.|30/NOV/09
33432|Stuart River Granite|Geophysical Expression|The unit has a low magnetic response on AIRDATA aeromagnetic images and a distinctive bright pink tone (potassic-rich signature) on the ternary K-Th-U radiometric image.|

24510|Sulieman Gneiss|Name source|Named after Sulieman Creek, whose tributaries drain much of the area in which the unit is exposed, Ardmore 1:100 000 Sheet area (Urandangi 1:250 000 Sheet area).|
24510|Sulieman Gneiss|Unit history|Previously mapped mainly as Eastern Creek Volcanics, and partly as Sybella Granite (Noakes & others, 1959).|
24510|Sulieman Gneiss|Type section locality|From GR 196702 to GR 223696, about 39 km SW of Dajarra, Ardmore 1:100 000 Sheet area. The type area extends E and W of the track between Rufus Tank and The Pinnacles Dam and is drained by Spring Creek and its tributaries. The main lithologies present in the type area are interlayered medium-grained quartz + biotite + microcline + plagioclase +/- garnet +/- muscovite gneiss and augen gneiss, hornblende schist and amphibolite, and reacrystallised, medium to coarse-grained glassy quartzite and muscovite quartzite. Minor rock types present include banded garnetiferous calc-silicate gneiss and granofels, para-amphibolite, quaratz-mica schist, quartz-feldspar pegmatite, and feldspar metaporphyry. Trends are mainly northerly and dips are fairly steep to vertical. Foliation and lithological layering commonly show small-scale folds and crenulations.|
24510|Sulieman Gneiss|Extent|The unit forms a narrow N-trending belt in the central part of the Ardmore 1:100 000 Sheet area, and extends S into the Glenormiston 1:250 000 Sheet area.|
24510|Sulieman Gneiss|Thickness range|The thickness of the unit is unknown. The unit has been complexly folded, and its base is apparently not exposed. Bedding is very poorly preserved.|
24510|Sulieman Gneiss|Lithology|The rocks are generally as in the type section.|
24510|Sulieman Gneiss|Relationships and boundaries|The unit appears to have a concordant, possibly gradational, contact with metaediments assigned to the Jayah Creek Metabasalt (which is interpreted to overlie the gneiss), and a gradational contact with the Kallala Quartzite - thin lenses of glassy recrystallised quartzite and muscovite quartzite occur in the Sulieman Gneiss adjacent to the contact. The Kallala Quartzite may overlie the Sulieman Gneiss. However, no facing evidence has been found in either the Sulieman Gneiss or Kallala Quartzite. The gneiss is extensively intruded by granite regarded as forming part of the Sybella Granite batholith. It is also cut by pegmatite veins of at least two different ages and by granite veins that may be of several different ages.|
24510|Sulieman Gneiss|Age reasons|Precambrian, probably Proterozoic.|
24510|Sulieman Gneiss|Proposed publication|Blake & others, in preparation|
24510|Sulieman Gneiss|Comments|Remarks: The Sulieman Gneiss has been regionally metamorphosed to amphibolite grade - the rocks are medium-grained, extensively recrystallised, and hornblende and clinopyroxene are common in the amphibolites and calc-silicates respectively. The common occurrence of minor chlorite, mainly replacing biotite, rarely amphibole, and sericite (replacing plagioclase) indicate that the formation has undergone a later low (greenschist) grade retrogressive regional metamorphism. The Sulieman Gneiss may be equivalent, at least partly, to the May Downs Gneiss mapped in the Mount Isa 1:100 000 Sheet area to the north (Derrick & others, 1976). However, hornblende schist, garnet-bearing gneiss and schist, para-amphibolite and calc-silicates have not been reported in the May Downs Gneiss by Derrick & others (1976).|

17534|Sunny Park Granodiorite|Geomorphic expression|The unit is characterised by gentle to moderately undulating terrain with rare tors and isolated boulder-sized outcrop.  On the Landsat 5 TM 1-4-7 (BGR) image, the Sunny Park Granodiorite is characterised by cleared areas with a yellow-orange hue. It has a strong, uniform magnetic response. The K response is high throughout the pluton, but the Th response is moderate in the south and high in the north.

17534|Sunny Park Granodiorite|Age reasons|The precise age is unknown, but because of its relationships to the Silver Hills Volcanics and similarity to the Kilmarnock Granodiorite, a Devonian age is assigned.|
17551|Surprise Creek Formation|Name source|Surprise Creek, a tributary of the Leichhardt River, which it joins 20 km west of Kajabbi, at latitude 20o01'35"S, longitude 139o50'40"E (6857-793852). The name "Surprise Creek Beds" was used by Carter & others (1961); it included rocks which are now mapped as Mount Isa Group, Myally Subgroup, and Surprise Creek and Quilalar Formations. However, a significant portion of the Surprise Creek Beds coincides with our proposed Surprise Creek Formation, hence we have retained the long-standing name "Surprise Creek" in this validation.|
17551|Surprise Creek Formation|Geomorphic expression|Basal sandstone and quartzite (Pra) forms rugged, upstanding ridges and plateaux; sandstones of Prc commonly form harrow ridges which contrast with the generally low hills and valleys developed over the siltstone-fine sandstone facies (Prb, Prb).|
17551|Surprise Creek Formation|Type section locality|The type section (holostratotype) of the Surprise Creek Beds proposed by Carter & others (1961) is in PROSPECTOR, 42 km southwest of Kajabbi; it extenads along Doughboy Creek westwards for 3 km to Glenroy homestead (6857-687533), then 2 km to the southwest. It was described by Carter & others as "faulted and incomplete". Nearly all of this type section is now mapped by us as Quilalar Formation and sediments of the Fiery Creek Volcanics; the remainder of Carter & others' type section includes rocks now mapped as Surprise Creek Formation, but extensive faulting renders this remaining section quite unsuitable for use as a type section for the proposed new unit, the Surprise Creek Formation. We therefore propose that the type section for the Surprise Creek Formation be as follows:- in ALSACE, just south of the Kajabbi-Gunpowder road, 25 km west-northwest of Kajabbi and 6 km northwest of the junction of Surprise Creek with the Leichhardt River. The base of the section is at latitude 19o59'20"S, longitude 139o48'20"E (6858-758883); the top of the section is 1.6 km west, at latitude 19o59'20"S, longitude 139o47'40"E (6858-743886). The type section exposes, from top to base, 300 m of cream, red-brown to buff-grey laminated siltstone, fine-grained sandstone and minor dolomitic sandstone (Prd). 170 m of buff to white medium-grained feldspathic sandstone and intercalated grey, green and buff siltstone and fine sandstone (Prc). 270 m of buff fine-grained feldspathic sandstone and siltstone, minor carbonaceous siltstone (Prd). 230 m of massive white, medium to coarse-grained feldspathic sandstone and pebbly sandstone (Pra). This section is overlain conformably by basal quartzite of the Mount Isa Group, and is underlain disconformably by dolomitic sediments within the Fiery Creek Volcanics. Reference sections (hypostratotypes) of the Surprise Creek Formation are located in ALSACE near 6858-800120, 16.5 km west of Dobbyn, where basal sandstone and conglomerate are exceptionally well developed; and in MYALLY along the old Dobbyn-Mount Oxide track near 6859-540635, 19 km northeast of Gunpowder, where the upper siltstone facies of the Formation is well developed. The latter section coincides largely with the reference section of Surprise Creek Beds nominated by Carter & others (1961), but includes a basal sandstone facies mapped by them as Myally Beds.|
17551|Surprise Creek Formation|Extent|In north-trending, complexly folded and faulted synclinal belts 2 to 20 km wide immediately east, west and south of the Ewen Block and north-northwest of Mount Isa; in tightly-folded basin-and-dome structures extending northwards from Gunpowder; in a narrow belt extending from north of Alhambra westwards and southwards around a broad dome of Weberra Granite, Myally Subgroup and Quilalar Formation; and as prominent quartzite inliers surrounded by McNamara Group rocks southwest of Gunpowder.|
17551|Surprise Creek Formation|Thickness range|The type section is 970 m thick; the reference sections are 1600 m and over 2000 m respectively. Thickness ranges from 200 m to over 2000 m; most thickness variation occurs in the basal conglomerate and pebbly sandstones.|05/DEC/06
17551|Surprise Creek Formation|Lithology|White, pale pink and buff medium to coarse-grained feldspathic sandstone (quartzite) and white clayey feldspathic sandstone; pebbly feldspathic sandstone and conglomerate; brown and gareen-grey micaceous sandstone and siltstone, minor shale, carbonaceous siltstone and ferruginous and dolomitic sandstone and siltstone. In most areas four informal subdivisions have been mapped; unit A (map symbol Pra) is the basal sandstone/conglomerate. Units B and D (Prb, Prd) are mainly siltstone and fine sandstone units separated by unit C (Prc), which in addition to siltstone contains a lower white sandstone marker and an upper brown sandstone marker traceable over large areas. Copper staining is present in units B, C, and D, especially the latter.|
17551|Surprise Creek Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The Surprise Creek Formation overlies the Fiery Creek Volcanics and in some areas the Quilalar Formation disconformably, or with slight angular unconformity. It is overlain disconformably by basal orthoquartzite (Warrina Park Quartzite) of the Mount Isa Group east of Gunpowder and by the Torpedo Creek Quartzite of the McNamara Group west of Gunpowder. Southwest and northwest of Gunpowder the basal McNamara Group quartzite rests disconformably on massive basal sandstone of the Surprise Creek Formation, which indicates erosion or non-deposition (probably the former) of the upper siltstone facies.|
17551|Surprise Creek Formation|Age reasons|Betaween 1680 m.y. (Carters Bore Rhyolite:- Fiery Creek Volcanics equivalent; Page, 1978) and about 1670 m.y., the age of tuff beds in the Mount Isa Group (Page, in prep.).|
17551|Surprise Creek Formation|Correlations|The Surprise Creek Formation sandstone facies and siltstone facies are correlated with the Deighton Quartzite and White Blow Formation of the Mount Albert Group, respectively, in the Eastern Succession across the Kalkadoon-Leichhardt Block to the east and southeast. To the west the Surprise Creek Formation is a correlative of, and replaces, all except the upper part of Mammoth formation (i.e. excluding the Torpedo Creek quartzite member) proposed by Cavaney (1975).|
17551|Surprise Creek Formation|Proposed publication|BMR Journal, 5(3) 1980|
17551|Surprise Creek Formation|Comments|Remarks: The Surprise Creek Formation is of economic interest because of widespread traces of copper mineralisation (mainly as stratiform or stratabound chalcocite and malchite) in units Pr, Prc and Prd; the nature of the mineralisation resembles Zambian copper-belt occurrences.|

Carbonate-rich siltstones are also common and can be traced along the surface strike for several kilometres.|
24512|Tangalooma Sandstone|Relationships and boundaries|The Tangalooma Sandstone conformably overlies the Taroom Coal Measures. In outcrop, the base of the unit is marked by the lowest resistant sandstone unit, whilst in subsurface it corresponds to the top of the last major coal member in the Taroom Coal Measures.

17850|Tareela Volcanics|Name source|The Tareela Volcanics was first named by Wyatt & others (1970) who gave the name to a sequence of andesitic and rhyolitic lavas and pyroclastics that crop out over much of the Parish of Tareela.|
17850|Tareela Volcanics|Unit history|The Tareela Volcanics were included in the Glenrock Group by Hutton & others (1994).|
17850|Tareela Volcanics|Constituents|Our mapping has subdivided the formation into two members and several unnamed units. Basaltic to andesite volcanics have been divided into the Ponto Basalt Member and the unnamed unit Ctb, whereas the rhyolitic volcanics have been assigned to the Eridge Volcanic Member and the unnamed units Ct1 and Cta.|
17850|Tareela Volcanics|Constituents|Two named units, the Ponto Basalt Member and the Eridge Volcanic Member (see separate definitions under respective names).|
17850|Tareela Volcanics|Type section locality|Wyatt & others (1970) did not give a type section for the Tareela Volcanics. Type sections mapped through the two named units, the Ponto Basalt Member and the Eridge Volcanic Member (see separate definitions), are designated here as a composite type section for the Tareela Volcanics|
17850|Tareela Volcanics|Extent|The Tareela Volcanics lie within a northwest-trending fault-bounded block, herein named the Tareela Graben which is some 11km wide and 25km long.|
17850|Tareela Volcanics|Thickness range|The overall thickness of the Tareela Volcanics is difficult to determine. However, on the western limb of the syncline between Little Star River and Star River, the Ponto Basalt Member is 1000m thick and the Eridge Member is 1500m thick.|
17850|Tareela Volcanics|Lithology|Unit Ct1:  Ct1 is the lowest unit of the Tareela Volcanics. It crops out on the western limb of a syncline and east of Little Star River in the core of the adjacent open anticline. The unit is predominantly light green, poorly sorted rhyolitic breccia, crystal-poor, moderately lithic-poor to lithic-rich rhyolitic lapilli breccia and minor spherulitic, flow-banded rhyolite.    Ponto Basalt Member:  The Ponto Basalt Member crops out between the Little Star River and Star River on the limbs of the syncline, and south of Little Star River in the anticline. It comprises dark grey, slightly to moderately porphyritic basalt to andesite, andesitic breccia, amygdaloidal basalt and basaltic andesite, andesitic lapilli breccia and aphyric basalt to andesite.   Eridge Member: The Eridge Member lies in the centre of a broad syncline between Little Star River and Star River. It consists predominantly of lithic-rich dacitic to rhyolitic volcaniclastics as described separately below.    Unit Cta:  Unit Cta  crops out north of Ben Lomond East, around the junction of the main two branches of Keelbottom Creek. The outcrop area is approximately 15km2. This unit is predominantly mottled green and maroon, crystal-poor to moderately crystal-rich, lithic-rich rhyodacite to rhyolite tuff and ignimbrite and felsic volcanic breccia. It is most likely equivalent to the Eridge Member because it also overlies the Ponto Member and is lithologically similar to unit Cte4 in the Eridge Member.    Unit Ctb: Unit Ctb overlies Cta. It consists of dark grey, aphyric to moderately porphyritic basalt and andesite, moderately crystal-rich, lithic-rich dacitic/andesitic lapilli breccia, and andesitic breccia. Like the Ponto Basalt Member, the unit forms generally recessive topography and is vegetated by good grass cover and scattered narrow-leaf ironbarks.|07/FEB/11
17850|Tareela Volcanics|Fossils|Lepidodendron veltheimianum was found in the Eridge Member (unit Cte1) at 8159-157687 in a volcaniclastic siltstone and suggests an Early Carboniferous age.  The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.|
17850|Tareela Volcanics|Relationships and boundaries|At the north western end and various other locations near the margin of the Tareela Graben, the Tareela Volcanics disconformably overlie Devonian to Early Carboniferous Keelbottom Group (DCk). On the margins of the graben, the Tareela Volcanics are faulted against the Keelbottom Group and early Palaeozoic Argentine Metamorphics and Melon Creek Tonalite. No units overlie the Tareela Volcanics but they have been extensively intruded by Carboniferous to Permian granite and rhyolite.  Similarities between rocks in the upper part of the Tareela Volcanics and rocks of the Saint Giles Volcanics suggest that these units are equivalent in part. Other possible equivalent formations in the Townsville 1:250 000 Sheet area of similar age and rock types are the Percy Creek Volcanics, Saint James Volcanics and Ewan Formation, all of which are part of the Glenrock Group.|07/FEB/11

24011|Taroborah Granodiorite|Geomorphic expression|The Taroborah Granodiorite is mostly overlain by Quaternary, Tertiary and Permian cover and therefore could not be identified on the Landsat 5 TM 1-4-7 (BGR) image. It does however, show a high magnetic response over a large area on the detailed airborne geophysical data, as well as the older, regional Bureau of Mineral Resources data. This indicates that the isolated outcrops are part of a largely concealed batholith, that has an area of at least 600 km2, extending east from near Sapphire for about 30 km. It is separated from the Retreat Batholith by a belt of relatively non-magnetic Anakie Metamorphic Group and Fork Lagoons beds. Mapped outcrop areas generally have low responses in K, U and Th.|

Other rocks observed include augite-hornblende-biotite quartz diorite, dark grey gabbro and pink monzodiorite containing aplite and pegmatite veins. However, generally the unit is very weathered and lateritised and represented by sandy soil and grus.|
24011|Taroborah Granodiorite|Relationships and boundaries|Intrudes the Fork Lagoons beds, although the actual contacts are obscured by Permian to Cainozoic cover. Hornfelsing of the Fork Lagoons beds in the Sapphire area indicates the near proximity of the concealed batholith.   The Taroborah Granodiorite is overlain by outliers of the Late Devonian to Early Carboniferous Silver Hills Volcanics near Gem Park homestead, and elsewhere by Permian Reids Dome beds and Aldebaran Sandstone, Tertiary Red Mountain Formation, duricrust, basalt, and extensive soil and colluvium.|
24011|Taroborah Granodiorite|Age reasons|Webb & others (1963) obtained K-Ar biotite and hornblende ages corrected to 372 Ma and 374 Ma respectively from a single sample from west of Anakie. The age is therefore probably Middle Devonian.|

36987|Taromeo Igneous Complex|Unit history|The Taromeo Igneous Complex is a new name for the Taromeo Tonalite as defined by Murphy & others (1976).  Gradwell (1949) informally named the complex as the 'Yarraman Granodiorite' and 'Taromeo Tonalite' and more recently Willey (1999) informally named the southern-most portion the 'Googa Googa Granodiorite' and 'Googa Googa Tonalite'respectively.|30/NOV/09
36987|Taromeo Igneous Complex|Geomorphic expression|Outcrop within the Taromeo Igneous Complex is generally poor with most of the units forming gently rolling soil covered hills and valleys.  Good exposures of rock can be found along the old coach road linking Blackbutt and Nanango (PRgmt) and beside Seven Mile Diggings Road south of Nanango (PRgmgd2).  Large tors of PRgmgd2 are present beside the D'Aguilar Highway north-west of Nanango.Tors of Rgmgd2 crop out on hillsides east of the D¿Aguilar Highway in the Cooyar Creek valley and scattered outcrop can be found on the hills north of Blackbutt near the abandoned Taromeo and Ashington mines.  Exposure of PRgmgd1 is poor although minor weathered outcrop is present in some gullies.  Duricrust and weathered Tertiary sediments and volcanics obscure the majority of the unit.Further north, exposure of Rgmd in the headwaters of Taromeo Creek is impressive where it forms prominent steep creek banks.  Sub-unit Rgmgd1 forms the topographically low area of the Googa Googa Creek valley and adjoining Emu Creek.  Here, scattered outcrop is present on the valley floor north of Emu Creek.  Subunit Rgmg is exposed as roadside boulders on the access road to Blackbutt Heights Estate.|30/NOV/09
36987|Taromeo Igneous Complex|Extent|The spatially and genetically related intrusions (Wherle, 1995) making up the complex, form a roughly north-north-west trending mass extending from Emu Creek, south of Blackbutt, to Barkers Creek north-west of Nanango and cover an overall area of approximately 300km2 (See Table 7).|30/NOV/09
36987|Taromeo Igneous Complex|Lithology|Gradwell (1949) described rocks of the area as being tonalite and granodiorite in composition.  Murphy and others (1976) acknowledged the variability of the Taromeo Igneous Complex and described rock types ranging from granite to gabbro.  Tonalite was found to be the dominant rock type.  Wherle (1995) also recognised two rock types within the complex, tonalite and granodiorite, but identified three granitoid groups using normalised REE patterns.  He considered that variations in rock geochemistry could most easily be explained through crystal fractionation (removal and accumulation) of mineral phases.  Current mapping has identified a wide range of rock types including tonalite, granodiorite, granite, quartz diorite, diorite, quartz gabbro and quartz monzodiorite. Costituents comprise:: PRgmt - major rock type appears to be tonalite although significant granodiorite is present , with minor granite and rare quartz gabbro.  Rgmg - Grey-pink medium to coarse-grained granite and granodiorite are main rock types.Rgmd - Primarily of quartz diorite and quartz monzodiorite, and minor diorite to granodiorite. Rgmgd2 - Light and dark grey granodiorites are main rock types but smaller proportions of granite, tonalite and quartz diorite are also present.  A smaller central portion is predominantly medium to coarse-grained grey-pink granite, and has been described as a separate unit (Rgmg).Rgmgd1 - Willey (1999) divided Rgmgd1 area into the `Googa Googa Tonalite¿ and `Googa Googa Granodiorite¿.  Unit Rgmgd1 is composed primarily of granodiorite (16km2) with tonalite (0.8km2) restricted to the easternmost portion of the unit.  Radiometric dating by Willey (1998) indicated the tonalite phase (240 Ma) is older than the granodiorite (233 Ma).  The eastern extremity of the unit abuts a leuco diorite (`Black Boy Hill Diorite¿) reported by Willey (1998) as Permian (270Ma) in age. Petrographic analysis of the granodiorite has revealed a composition of oligoclase-andesine plagioclase (30-50%), quartz (15-40%), orthoclase (5-10%), hornblende (5-10%), biotite (10-15%) and accessory sphene, zircon and opaques.  The tonalite phase was described by Willey (1999), as `hornblende (12-22%), biotite (3-8%), oligoclase (55-62%) and quartz (18-22%)¿.PRgmgd2 - Murphy and others (1976) nominated this unit as the type area for Taromeo Tonalite - composed primarily of grey medium grained granodiorite but also contains quartz monzonite, quartz monzodiorite, tonalite and granite.|30/NOV/09
36987|Taromeo Igneous Complex|Relationships and boundaries|The Taromeo Igneous Complex intrudes the Devonian to Carboniferous Maronghi Creek beds and Sugarloaf Metamorphics, and the Permian to Triassic Gilla Volcanics.  At least part of the complex intrudes the Early to Middle Triassic Esk Formation near the Red Queen Mine.  Murphy and others (1976) reported a faulted contact with the Esk Formation east of Benarkin.  Tertiary sediments and Tertiary Main Range Volcanics overlie part the complex.Within the complex, PRgmt, PRgmgd2 and PRgmgd1 appear to be oldest and are crosscut or intruded by the younger phases Rgmgd2, Rgmgd1 and Rgmd.  At least part of the complex intrudes the Early to Middle Triassic Esk Formation near the Red Queen Mine.  Murphy and others (1976) reported a faulted contact with the Esk Formation east of Benarkin.  Tertiary sediments and Tertiary Main Range Volcanics overlie part the complex.Within the complex, PRgmt, PRgmgd2 and PRgmgd1 appear to be oldest and are crosscut or intruded by the younger phases Rgmgd2, Rgmgd1 and Rgmd.|30/NOV/09
36987|Taromeo Igneous Complex|Age reasons|Staff of the University of Queensland recalculated six radiometric age dates for different areas of the Taromeo Igneous Complex using 1980 constants (Holcombe and others, 1998).  Recalculation of the original GSQ, Webb and McDougall (1968) and Harding (1969) dates gives an age range of hornblende Ar/Ar 263.3 Ma to biotite K/Ar 225.7 Ma.  Significantly, the oldest and youngest ages were calculated from the same quartz monzonite sample located within PRgmgd2.  Together with other ages recorded from PRgmt [242.9 Ma Webb and McDougall (1968)] and Rgmgd1 [233, 240 Ma (Willey, 1998)] an age of Latest Permian to Late Triassic can be assigned to this complex.  The crosscutting relationship displayed by Rgmgd2 on the RTP magnetic image shows it to be younger than PRgmt (242.9 Ma).  This is confirmed by an Ar/Ar date of 229¿11 Ma (Green, UQ unpublished laboratory notes).  No radiometric dates have been undertaken on unit Rgmd although its intrusive relationship shown by hornfelsing of Early to Middle Triassic Esk Formation (AMG 416700 7035400) indicates a probable Middle-Late Triassic age.  A relational age for unit PRgmgd1 is difficult to establish.  A paucity of outcrop, deep weathering and Tertiary cover makes sampling for radiometric dating difficult.  The grid references are based on the AGD66 datum.|30/NOV/09
36987|Taromeo Igneous Complex|Geochemistry|Geochemical samples were collected for all subunits, except PRgmgd1, and analysed at the Government Chemical Laboratories.  All samples were obtained using a sledgehammer.  Analyses have been plotted onto standard geochemical diagrams and are presented in the geochemistry chapter of this report.|30/NOV/09
36987|Taromeo Igneous Complex|Comments|MINERALISATION - Several abandoned mines and mineral occurrences are present in PRgmt and were worked for gold and copper in the early part of this century, although returns were low (Randall and others, 1996).  Seven-Mile Diggings, Yarraman Creek diggings and Resurrection Mine, all exploited low-grade alluvial gold.  Sawers (1967) reported the presence of minor bismuthinite at the Bismuth Prospect, close to the Seven-Mile Diggings.  Ashington Mine, Taromeo Copper Mine and Golden Bird Mine produced copper, gold and silver from chloritic and silicic altered shear zones within PRgmt.  Small amounts of cobaltite were noted at Golden Bird (Denmead, 1934).|30/NOV/09

17919|Teddy Mount Formation|Unit history|Previously mapped as part of the Bundock Creek Formation (now Group) by White (1959, 1962, 1965), and 'upper' Bundock Creek Formation by Wyatt & Jell (1980).  The name was first published and described by Withnall & others (1988), but was not formally defined.|
17919|Teddy Mount Formation|Geomorphic expression|The Teddy Mount Formation has a subdued outcrop pattern because of the dominance of siltstone and mudstone.  Sporadic widely spaced ridges are formed by sandstone and limestone.  It has a smooth-textured aerial photo-pattern reflecting the usually well-grassed cover, with an open canopy of tall ironbarks and other eucalypts.|
17919|Teddy Mount Formation|Type section locality|A composite section is designated.  The lower part is along Montgomery Creek from 7859 518463 (base) to 521481 and then along an unnamed tributary normal to strike to 518488 (base of Dyraaba Member).  The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.|
17919|Teddy Mount Formation|Description at type locality|The base of the Teddy Mount Formation is placed at the bottom of a sequence of very thick-bedded, greenish grey, calcareous mudstone and siltstone about 230 m thick).  This is overlain by 780 m of a generally coarser sequence of very thick-bedded brown mudstone with interbeds of thin to very thick-bedded, fine to medium-grained grey, lithofeldspathic to feldspathic, micaceous, calcareous sandstone.  Above this, 25 m of pale, brown-grey mudstone underlies the Dyraaba Member.  The upper part of the composite section is the type section of the Dyraaba Member in a tributary of Mount Brown Creek, about 3 km to the southwest of the lower section, between 499462 and 497466.  It is 385 m thick and consists of sandstone (similar to that in the lower part of the unit), siltstone, and mudstone.  Plant remains are abundant.See Withnall & others (1988, pages 90-92) for more details.|
17919|Teddy Mount Formation|Extent|Widely distributed from near 'Gregory Springs' in the southwest to Teddy Mount in the northeast, and 'Oak Valley' in the northwest.|
17919|Teddy Mount Formation|Thickness range|1420 m in the type section.  Elsewhere the overall thickness is difficult to determine because of the folding.|
17919|Teddy Mount Formation|Lithology|Fine to medium-grained, micaceous, feldspathic to lithofeldspathic, calcareous sandstone, siltstone, mudstone, and minor dirty limestone.  The sandstones contain small to medium-scale trough and low-angle planar and tabular cross-beds, ripple cross-laminae, horizontal planar laminae, parting lineation, and  soft-sediment deformation.  Ripple cross-laminae, planar laminae, and burrows are common in the finer lithologies.|
17919|Teddy Mount Formation|Fossils|The Teddy Mount Formation contains an abundant shallow marine fauna dominated by gastropods; brachiopods, bivalves, nautiloids, crinoids, bryozoans, and fish scales also occur. Microfossils include ostracodes, phyllocarids, fish teeth and other microremains, together with rare conodonts.  The fauna is described in more detail by Lang (1985, 1986a), and is summarised by Withnall & others (1988).|22/JAN/13
17919|Teddy Mount Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Conformably overlies the Turrets Formation and distinguished by being more calcareous and containing more sparsely distributed sandstone beds.  It contains the Dyraaba Member which is distinguished by the presence of abundant plant remains, and by being more sandy.  The Teddy Mount Formation is conformably overlain by the Boroston Formation, and is distinguished from it by the lack of quartz-rich sandstones.  It is intruded by the Carboniferous or ?Permian Montgomery Range Igneous Complex.|
17919|Teddy Mount Formation|Age reasons|The rare conodonts indicate a latest Famennian age. The unit may range into the Tournaisian.|

The greenish-grey to dark greenish-grey claystone contains three major oil shale beds, the uppermost being a very distinctive marker throughout The Narrows Graben. In the type section the oil shale beds are from 180.0 to 185.2 m, 208.9 to 211.0 m and 215.6 to 217.8 m. There are numerous thin impure dolomite lenses (up to 1.35 m thick); a 14 cm thick dolomite bed marks the base of the member. In part, the claystone is strongly calcareous. Minor oil shale beds occur in the basal part of the type section, from 241.0 to 241.6 m and from 247.7 to 250.5 m.|
26167|Telegraph Creek Member|Extent|Subcrops in an area of about 28 km2 in The Narrows Graben, NW of Gladstone, Queensland. Sparse, weathered outcrops are recorded.

26167|Telegraph Creek Member|Lithology|Claystone, greenish-grey to dark greenish-grey, soft to moderately hard, generally calcareous, mostly thickly bedded but in places thinly laminaated or brecciated. There are tough impure dolomite beds (up to 1.4 m thick) at various stratigraphic levels within the member but these are generally not correlatable between drill holes. Two persistent impure dolomite beds (0.1 to 0.5 m apart) commonly form the base of the member. Two oill shale beds (0.5 to 2 m thick) and 4 to 6 m apart are persistent in the central part of the member. A very persistent oil shale marker bed up to 10 m thick occurs from 10 to 15 m below the top of the member. There are two persistent oil shale beds within the basal 20 m of the member which attenuate along the eastern margin of the graben. To the northwest and east within the graben, there are sandy claystone and sandstone interbeds and a decrease in the thickness of oil shale beds. Current bedding is recorded in the upper sandy claystones in the northwestern part of the graben. Cyclicity of rock types within the member is common and there are desiccation features throughout the sequence. Ther are sporadic gastropod and ostracode fossils and rare vertebrate remains. Bioturbation occurs within the claystone, particularly where sandy.|

17975|Termite Range Formation|Unit history|The rocks now mapped as the Termite Range Formation were previously included in the Ploughed Mountain Beds by Carter & others (1961). Cavaney (1975) originally named this unit the "Gregory Quartzite" but this name is invalid due to previous usage.|21/SEP/06
17975|Termite Range Formation|Type section locality|Holostratotype: Across the southern part of the Termite Range between 576070 (base) and 560064 (top) in the Lawn Hill 1:100 000 Sheet area. This section lies about 14 km northeast of Riversleigh homestead. It comprises three subunits, the lower (240 m) and upper (300 m) ofa which consist of massive, structureless quartzwacke, greywacke and sandstone rhythmically interbedded with siltstone. The upper subunit contains a higher percentage of massive arenite beds than the lower. The middle subunit comprises 540 m of interbedded light coloured clayey siltstone and ferruginous, coarse quartz siltstone.|
17975|Termite Range Formation|Extent|The unit is best exposed in the Termite Range and in a series of domes and anticlines (such as the Ploughed Mountain anticline in the Lawn Hill Sheet area) which extend from the Gregory River near Riversleigh in the south to Elizabeth Creek in the northern part of the Bowthorn Sheet area in the north, and from Archie Creek in the east to the Constance Range escarpment in the west.|
17975|Termite Range Formation|Thickness range|The unit is 1080 m thick in the type section, and has a minimum thickness of 200 m on the western flank of the Kamarga Dome.|
17975|Termite Range Formation|Lithology|Outside the Termite Range area, the three-fold subdivision of the unit is not recognised. The basal subunit lenses out and the central subunit becomes indistinguishable from the underlying Riversleigh Siltstone. In the Ploughed Mountain and Caroline Range areas, approximately 550 m of greywacke, quartzwacke and sandstone with interbedded siltstone crop out. Similar lithologies crop out in a series of anticlinal structures in the eastern part of the Bowthorn Sheet area.|
17975|Termite Range Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The Termite Range Formation conformably overlies the Riversleigh Siltstone and is conformably overlain by the Lawn Hill Formation. Both upper and lower boundaries are marked by a strong change in relief from low rolling hills of the Riversleigh Siltstone and Lawn Hill Formation to the high relief furrowed appearance of the Termite Range Formation. Where the basal subunit lenses out, the middle subunit is indistinguishable from the underlying Riversleigh Siltstone and is mapped as part of it on the Lawn Hill 1:100 000 Geological Map.|

25525|Tewinga Group|Name source|Tewinga County, which covers the northeastern quarter of the Prospector 1:100 000 Sheet area (6857) and extends on to the adjoining sheets to the north, northeast and east. The County surrounds the township of Kajabbi, which is located at latitude 20o02'S, longitude 140o02'E.|
25525|Tewinga Group|Constituents|The Tewinga Group consists of the Leichhardt Metamorphics, the Magna Lynn Metabasalt and the Argylla Formation.|
25525|Tewinga Group|Extent|The group has been mapped in the Dobbyn, Cloncurry and Duchess 4-mile Geological Sheet areas (Carter et al., 1961), but mapping of the Marraba, Mary Kathleen and Prospector 1:100 000 Sheet areas has shown the Group to be less extensive than previously mapped (Derrick et al., 1971; Derrick et al., 1974; Wilson et al., in prep.). The main exposure occurs in a north-trending belt about 30 km wide and 280 km long which extends from 70 km south of Duchess to 50 km horth of Kajabbi. West of this belt one large outcrop is present about 50 km northwest of Kajabbi and to the east several separate blocks of Tewinga Group rocks crop out as a result of faulting and/or folding. Large fold and fault blocks are also located in the Duck Creek and Bulonga Anticlines (15 to 50 km southeast of Mary Kathleen), near the Blockade copper mine (5 to 25 km northwest of Mary Kathleen), and in the contact zone of the Wonga Granite (north and south of Mary Kathleen). A smaller outcrop of Argylla Formation occurs 10 km west-northwest of Cloncurry.|
25525|Tewinga Group|Thickness range|The minimum thickness of the Group is in excess of 200 m, and some sequences are at least 5000 m thick. The base of the Group is not exposed.|
25525|Tewinga Group|Lithology|Metamorphosed acid and basic volcanic rocks, minor arenaceous metasediments, muscovite schists and acid to intermediate gneisses.|
25525|Tewinga Group|Relationships and boundaries|No older units are known in the region. The Group is overlain unconformably or disconformably by the Mount Guide Quartzite, Eastern Creek Volcanics and Surprise Creek Beds in the west and the Ballara Quartzite and the Deighton Quartzite in the east. The Marraba Volcanics appear to overlie the Group conformably. The Group is intruded by the Kalkadoon Granite, Wonga Granite, Wimberu Granite, several swarms of dolerite dykes, and some acid porphyry bodies.|
25525|Tewinga Group|Age reasons|The base of the Group is considered to be the base of the Carpentarian succession (Middle Proterozoic) in the Mount Isa/Cloncurry region. Rubidium-strontium dating of the Leichhardt Metamorphics and Argylla Formation has produced a range of dates, some of which are dubious, but a minimum age of about 1710 m.y. is probable for the Leichhardt Metamorphics (R.W. Page, BMR, pers. comm.). Published dates on the Ewen and Kalkadoon Granites which intrude the Group ranges from 1660 m.y. (Page & Derrick, 1973) to 1930 m.y. (Farquharson & Wilson, 1971). The tewinga Group has been tentatively correlated with the Cliffdale and Edith River Volcanics in Queensland and the Northern Territory, which are dated at about 1770 to 1750 m.y. old respectively (Plumb & Derrick, 1975).|

27302|The Fisheries Basalt|Unit history|Previously included in the Atherton Basalt by Best (1960) and de Keyser (1964).|
27302|The Fisheries Basalt|Type section locality|Several basalt flows in an unnamed tributary of the Mulgrave River at GR 636997 (Bartle Frere 1:100 000 Sheet area), 800 m southwest of The Fisheries. Outcrops consist of fine-grained basalt with rare phenocrysts and vesicules. Moderately weathered basalt of a flow on the ridge crest caps completely weathered or decomposed basalt in a lower flow or flows nearer to Goldsborough Road.|
27302|The Fisheries Basalt|Extent|Numerous scattered outliers restricted to the valleys of the Mulgrave River and Little Mulgrave River. Total area of exposure of about 42 km2.|
27302|The Fisheries Basalt|Lithology|Dark grey, fine-grained basalt; porphyritic texture with phenocrysts of olivine and minor augite. Vesicular variants are subordinate. Some chilled olivine basalt has a glassy groundmass. Cinder or klinker material is associated with a scoria cone at an eruption centre (GR 665014) east of The Fisheries. Light to dark grey, porous travertine limestone exposed in the Little Mulgrave River valley appears to have formed on the basalt in freshwater bogs between volcanic eruptions.|
27302|The Fisheries Basalt|Relationships and boundaries|The Fisheries Basalt represents part of the Atherton Volcanic Province. Lavas erupted from an assymetrical scoria cone east of The Fisheries flowed into the Mulgrave River valley, and backed up into the West Mulgrave River and Little Mulgrave River. Lavas erupted from volcanoes on the Atherton Tableland may have contributed minor amounts to the sequence by descending the escarpment via Toohey Creek and possibly Christmas Creek. The basalt flows unconformably overlie the Hodgkinson Formation and the Bellenden Ker Granite.|
27302|The Fisheries Basalt|Age reasons|Uncertain, but probably Pliocene to Pleistocene (de Keyser, 1964; Stephenson & others, 1980). Considerable dissection of the lavas by the Mulgrave River suggests at least an early Pleistocene age.|

18185|Timothy Creek Sandstone Member|Name source|Named after Timothy Creek which drains part of the outcrop area west of Dajarra, Ardmore 1:100 000 Sheet area (Urandangi 1:250 000 Sheet area).|
18185|Timothy Creek Sandstone Member|Unit history|Mapped as Eastern Creek Volcanics by Noakes & others (1959).|
18185|Timothy Creek Sandstone Member|Type section locality|About 17 km NW of Dajarra, from GR 314089 to GR 332104. The lower part of the member consists of mainly sericitic meta-arenite which grades up into quartzose, feldspathic, and sericitic meta-arenite and minor quartzite and rare quartz-muscovite schist in the upper part. Scattered rounded pebbles and thin pebbly beds occur in the sequence. Cross-beds and ripple marks are common in the meta-arenites and quartzites, many of which (especially the sericitic meta-arenites) are friable.|
18185|Timothy Creek Sandstone Member|Extent|The member forms a NNE-trending belt of prominent ridges and hills in the E of the Ardmore 1:100 000 Sheet area, and extends N into the Oban 1:100 000 Sheet area.|
18185|Timothy Creek Sandstone Member|Thickness range|The ;member is about 2000 m thick in the type section. It appears to be significantly thicker in the far N of the Ardmore 1:100 000 Sheet area, but the sequence has been extensively deformed there and may be folded or partly repeated by faulting, or both.|
18185|Timothy Creek Sandstone Member|Lithology|The predominent lithologies in the member are similar to those described above. Minor rock types present include micaceous metasiltstone, dark grey fine-grained quartzite, fine-grained quartz-sericite schist, labile meta-arenite, and fine to medium-grained quartz-biotite-muscovite schist.|
18185|Timothy Creek Sandstone Member|Relationships and boundaries|The member is overlain and underlain, apparently conformably, by mafic metavolcanics and interlayered metasediments mapped as part of the Jayah Creek Metabasalt. It is cut by numerous, mainly northerly-trending dykes and pods of metadolerite.|

24524|Tin Hill Quartzite Member|Extent|Forms a series of large ridges near the Robertson River between the Forsayth-Agate Creek and Forsayth-Robin Hood roads. The unit is traceable farther east towards the Newcastle Range, but does not form any prominent topographic feature.|
24524|Tin Hill Quartzite Member|Thickness range|5 to 40 m.|
24524|Tin Hill Quartzite Member|Lithology|Mainly white quartzite consisting almost wholly of quartz. Some finer-grained grey quartzite is also present and minor schist is interlayered.|
24524|Tin Hill Quartzite Member|Relationships and boundaries|The unit is a member of the Robertson River Formation (mainly within the "schist phase"). Although there appear to be three distinct quartzite layers, detailed mapping and structural analysis by T.H. Bell and M.J. Rubenach of James Cook University (pers. comm., 1978) have shown these to be one layer folded by isoclinal folds with roughly horizontal axes. The Tin Hill Quartzite member is within the lower part of the Robertson River Formation, but its position with respect to the Dead Horse Metabasalt Member is not yet known.|
24524|Tin Hill Quartzite Member|Age reasons|Proterozoic; older than 1570 m.y. which is the age of the first deformation and metamorphic event in the Etheridge Group (Black & Others, 1978).|

18263|Toko Group|Name source|From Toko Range in TOBERMORY-GLENORMISTON-MOUNT WHELAN.|
18263|Toko Group|Name source|(Orig. Defn) Toko Range, straddling the Queensland-Northern Territory border west of Boulia.|10/MAY/13
18263|Toko Group|Unit history|(Orig. Defn) The term Toko was first used by Whitehouse (1936) as the Toko Series which referred to a sequence of Middle Ordovician age. The sequence comprising a cephalopod-rich limestone overlain by flat lying sandstones containing asaphid trilobites occupies the Toko Ranges, westward to the Tarlton Range and beyond. There is no doubt that the sequence described as the Toko Series by Whitehouse is the upper part of the Nora Formation and the Carlo Sandstone. The Toko Series were the only Ordovician rocks known in the area at that time. In 1953, the Geological Map of Queensland used the name Toko Group for marine Ordovician rocks southwest of a line joining old Linda Downs homestead and Mount Idamea. That is, it was used for all Ordovician rocks above the Ninmaroo Formation as now defined. Casey (1959) preferred the name Toko Beds for the Early-Middle Ordovician rocks overlying the Ninmaroo Formation, but excluded an undifferentiated sandstone of either Ordovician or Devonian age. Beds were used because the formations had not yet been named. Pritchard (1960) followed Casey's usage although his informal unit Om-11, which is partly equivalent to the undifferentiated sandstone of Casey, is included within the Toko Beds. Following the naming of the constituent units, Casey (in Smith, 1963) proposed the term Toko Group to include the Kelly Creek Formation, Coolibah Formation, Nora Formation, Carlo Sandstone and Mithaka Formation, but subsequently (Casey in Smith, 1965), the Kelly Creek Formation was deleted from the Group. Smith (1972) in the major publication on the stratigraphy of the Georgina Basin accepted the latter. Recently, the recognition of the Ethabuka Sandstone (Draper, in preparation) has resulted in a need to redefine the Toko Group. The inclusion of the Ethabuka Sandstone in the Group is based on lithological similarities with the underlying units. Unit Om-11 of Pritchard is equivalent to the Ethabuka Sandstone (Draper, in preparation) and was placed in the Toko Beds by him. Therefore, on both lithological and on historical grounds the Ethabuka Sandstone is placed in the Toko Group. The depletion of the Coolibah Formation from the Toko Group is based on purely lithologic grounds. The Coolibah Formation (Casey, in Smith, 1965) is dominantly a carbonate unit with the carbonates generally being fine grained and of algal origin (Shergold & others, 1976). On the other hand, the Nora Formation and the overlying units are siliciclastic except for some skeletal limestones in the Nora Formation, which is transgressive on the Coolibah Formation. It is therefore considered that the Coolibah Formation does not have sufficient lithological features in common with the Nora Formation and the overlying units to warrant its inclusion in the Toko Group. The Toko Group is hereby redefined to exclude the Coolibah Formation.|10/MAY/13
18263|Toko Group|Unit history|(2003 Defn) This new definition of the Toko Group is basically a return to the concept of the Toko Series of Whitehouse (1936) who applied the name to dominantly clastic rocks overlying dominantly carbonate rocks.  Toko Series (Whitehouse 1936); lower-medial portion of Dulcie Sandstone of Joklik (1955) in part; units Ol-6 to Ol-8 and Om-9 to Om-11 of Pritchard (1960) in part; Ethabuka beds (Mulready 1975) in part; Withillindarmna Dolostone Member (Radke and Duff 1980) in part.|10/MAY/13

18263|Toko Group|Extent|(Orig. Defn) The Toko Group rocks constitute the scarp, plateau and internal hills of the Toko Range. It is also present in the associated Toomba Range and in the Tarlton Range in the Northern Territory where the upper part of the Group is eroded. The Nora Formation is also present in the Dulcie Range further west. In the subsurface, it is known from the Toko Syncline.|10/MAY/13

18263|Toko Group|Thickness range|(Orig. Defn) The maximum known thickness is 1678 m in AOD Ethabuka No. 1, although the upper part may have been eroded.|10/MAY/13
18263|Toko Group|Lithology|(Orig. Defn) Quartzose sandstone, commonly containing clay pellets, siltstone and mudstone. Skeletal limestones are present in the Nora Formation; these brachiopod-rich limestones contain numerous cephalopod fossils.|10/MAY/13
18263|Toko Group|Fossils|(Orig. Defn) A prolific and varied fauna is found throughout the group particularly within the Nora and Mithaka Formations. The fauna includes trilobites, nautiloids, brachiopods, pelecypods, rostroconchs, conodonts, gastropods, Receptaculites, sponge spicules, bryozoa, fish, chitinozoans, and ostracods. Abundant ichnofossils are present.|10/MAY/13

18263|Toko Group|Relationships and boundaries|(Orig. Defn) The group conformably overlies the Coolibah Formation and is conformably overlain by either the Devonian Cravens Peak Beds or Mesozoic rocks. The Ordovician sequence in the Toko Range area is, from top to bottom: Ethabuka Sandstone; Mithaka Formation; Carlo Sandstone; and Nora Formation (Toko Group). Coolibah Formation; Kelly Creek Formation; Ninmaroo Formation.|10/MAY/13
18263|Toko Group|Age reasons|(Orig. Defn) Based on various faunal studies, the age ranges from Lower Ordovician (Arenik) for the Nora Formation (Shergold & othes, 1976) to Middle Ordovician for the Ethabuka Sandstone (Draper, in preparation).|10/MAY/13
18263|Toko Group|Age reasons|Conodonts suggest late Late Cambrian (late Datsonian; Jones et al 1971) or early Early Ordovician (early Warendian; Druce in Shergold 1978, revised according to Shergold and Nicoll 1992) age for basal Kelly Creek Formation. Diverse but largely undescribed fauna of Ethabuka Sandstone suggests a Middle Ordovician (late Llanvirnian) age (Shergold 1985).|

18263|Toko Group|Comments|Casey (in Smith 1963a), Smith (1972) and Draper (1980b) have outlined the nomenclatural history of the Toko Group. The original Toko Series of Whitehouse (1936) was intended to encompass all Ordovician rocks (at that time unnamed) west of Boulia, Queensland. Following subdivision and naming of the succession, Casey (in Smith 1963a) assigned the Kelly Creek Formation to Mithaka Formation inclusive to the Toko Group. Subsequently, Casey (in Smith 1965) excluded the Kelly Creek Formation. Draper (1980b) additionally excluded the Coolibah Formation and included the Ethabuka Sandstone. Webby et al (1981) rejected Draper's (1980b) proposals and retained the conception of Casey (in Smith 1965), and this was followed by Kruse et al (2002a). The present conception of the group is thus the most inclusive yet advanced, but accords with the intentions of Whitehouse (1936). The Kelly Creek Formation is included in the Toko Group rather than the Cockroach Group because of its Ordovician age, and because of its reported local basal disconformity (Reynolds 1968, Jones et al 1971).|10/MAY/13

26176|Tommy Creek Microgranite|Comments|Discussion: The microgranite is easily misidentified as a sheared feldspathic quartzite but it lacks any sedimentary structures and commonly has phenocrysts set in a very fine-grained quartzo-feldspathic mosaic. This texture is more typical of a volcanic rather than an intrusive rock and it is probable that the Tommy Creek Microgranite is a sub-volcanic equivalent of a deeper-seated acid intrusion such as the Naraku Granite, which crops out about 10 km to the northeast. Some of the ;Microgranite may represent acid lavas or tuffs that were cogmagmatic with the intrusion. The Tommy Creek Microgranite was previously mapped as Naraku Granite in the Pinnacles area, Chumvale Breccia in an area 3 to 6 km northwest of Butcher Bore, and in other areas it was not differentiated from the Corella Formation.|

18370|Toole Creek Volcanics|Name source|Toole Creek, 20 km southeast of Cloncurry, latitude 20o50'S, longitude 140o40'E, i.e. (7056 665965).|
18370|Toole Creek Volcanics|Geomorphic expression|This formation forms low rounded bouldery ridges and hills.|
18370|Toole Creek Volcanics|Type section locality|The proposed type section is the eastern end of the section which was used by Carter et al. (1961) in defining the Soldiers Cap Formation. It is about 32 km southeast of Cloncurry and eaxteands for 4.5 km from a point at latitude 20o54'40"S, longitude 140o43'30"E (7056 713875) to a point on Weatherly Creek at latitude 20o53'40"S, longitude 140o45'30"E (7056 750895). The base (western end) of this type section is marked by a thin belt of amphibolite that is probably ;metabasalt. It is overlain by 750 m of alternating metabasalt and metasediment, mainly metasiltstone, slate and some chert. This sequence is overlain by 1000 m of metasiltstone, slate, chert, and quartzite, then 300 m of metabasalt, 300 m of metasiltstone, slate, chert and quartzite, and at the eastern end of the section, about 500 m of chert and pelitic metasediments containing several bands of amphibolite. The top of the formation is not exposed in the type section.|
18370|Toole Creek Volcanics|Extent|The Toole Creek Volcanics are exposed in a complex, tighly folded, wedge-shaped zone that extends 25 km east and 50 km southeast from Cloncurry. Most of this formation is in the Cloncurry 1:100 000 Sheet area and has been delineated by Glikson & Derrick (1970). The southern extension into the Mount Angelay 1:100 000 Sheet area has been interpreted mainly from air-photographs (Glikson, 1972), and occurs in a belt flanking the Fullarton River.|
18370|Toole Creek Volcanics|Thickness range|The formation is at least 2800 m thick.|
18370|Toole Creek Volcanics|Lithology|Metabasalt, metadolerite, ortho-amphibolite, metasiltstone, phyllite, slate, feldspathic sandstone, chert, jaspilite, and calc-silicate rocks.|
18370|Toole Creek Volcanics|Relationships and boundaries|The Toole Creek Volcanics are underlain conformably by the Mount Norna Quaratzite and overlain unconformably by the Corella Formation, the Roxmere Quartzite, and Mesozoic strata. The formation is intruded by dolerite, the Naraku Granite and the Williams Granite.|
18370|Toole Creek Volcanics|Age reasons|Precambrian, probably Carpentarian (Middle Proterozoic).|

18370|Toole Creek Volcanics|Comments|Remarks: Honman (1939) included this unit in his Upper or Volcanic stage of the Soldiers Cap series. Carter et al. (1961) recognised this sequence of "interbedded metabasalt, cherty quartzite, chert and slate" but did not formally define it as a subdivision of the Soldiers Cap Formation. The name Toole Creek metavolcanics was used as an informal stratigraphic term by Glikson (1972). The formal name proposed here is Toole Creek Volcanics, which is consistent with the usage of Volcanics in naming other basic metavolcanic units in the region e.g. Eastern Creek Volcanics and Marraba Volcanics (Carter et al., 1961). These three stratigraphic units are considered to be broadly correlative. The topmost 800 m of mainly metasedimentary rocks in the upper part of this formation were previously mapped as the Mount Norna Quartzite in an area 15 to 20 km east-northeast of Cloncurry township (Glikson & Derrick, 1970; Glikson, 1972). In this area the upper Toole Creek Formation sequence of iron formation and siltstone; greywacke, feldspathic quartzite and minor basalt; and topmost stromatolitic chert, jaspilite and calcareous shale are now thought to be lateral equivalents of the upper Marraba Volcanics, Mitakoodi Quartzite and Overhang Jaspilite, respectively.|

18375|Toolebuc Formation|Type section locality|Casey (1959) nominated a type area "on the Boulia-Winton main road 7 miles east of Hamilton" in the Boulia 1:250 000 Sheet area, and a reference section "6 miles east of Spring Creek artesian bore". Unfortunately due to an error in the geographic location of this reference section it cannot be relocated. Casey (pers. comm.) agrees an alternate section be defined as the type section of this unit. Because of poor exposure of this unit a drill hole section near Casey's (1959) type area is proposed as the type section.|
18375|Toolebuc Formation|Identifying features|Introduction: The late Albian Toolebuc Member of the Wilgunya Formation was defined by Casey (1959) from the Boulia area of the northwest Eromanga Basin. Vine et al. (1967) upgraded the member to Toolebuc Limestone. Smart (1972) discussed the Toolebuc Limestone in some detail and showed that it is a heterogenous unit and that "Toolebuc Formation" would be a more appropriate name, although he did not rename it. The present authors agree with Smart (1972) that the formation is heterogeneous, and recent drilling by the BMR (Senior & Smart, 1973; Burger 1974) has confirmed that limestone is subordinate to calcareous and bituminous siltstone, black labile sandstone, and shale. Limestone is in fact absent in some areas (Williamson, 1967; D. Senior, 1971). Accordingly we propose the name TOOLEBUC FORMATION for the calcareous heterogeneous sequence which overlies the Wallumbilla Formation and underlies the Allara Mudstone. Definition: The type section of the Toolebuc Formation is designated as the sequence between 25.3 and 35.8 m in stratigraphic drill hole BMR Boulia 3A. The hole was drilled 13.7 km east of Hamilton, about 100 m north of the Boulia-Winton Highway. (Type section/hole location 22o47'00"S, 140o43'30"E). The sequence consists of black mudstone with a few thin limestone beds and shell fragments down to 30.5 m, and hard concretionary limestone and thin crystalline limestone beds interbedded with soft black mudstone down to 35.8 m. The core is available for inspection at the Bureau of Mineral Resources Core and Cuttings Laboratory, Fyshwick, ACT.|

18404|Toondahra Granite|Unit history|The unit was mapped initially by Withnall (1971) as part of a honours thesis in the southern part of the Munduberra 1: 250 000 Sheet area.  The unit was included on the Munduberra 1:250 000 map Sheet (Whitaker & others, 1974).|
18404|Toondahra Granite|Geomorphic expression|The unit is characterised by a very strongly developed pattern of north-east and north-west joints.  The northern part of the unit (north-west of Manar homestead) forms high resistant hills.  This photopattern is typical of tin granites in Queensland (similar to the Elizabeth Creek Granite in North Queensland, and the Crows Nest Granite to the south).  The unit contains topographically flat areas (due to weathering) at the top of the range about 5 km north-west of Manar.  In this area the vegetation is dominated by grass trees (Xanthorrea sp. And paperbarks (Melaleuca sp.).  Callitrus sp with local ironbark dominates vegetation adjacent to the Boyne River in this unit north of Boondooma Dam.  This vegetation is associated with either rhyolite or microgranite exposures.|
18404|Toondahra Granite|Extent|The unit occurs adjacent to outcrop of Aranbanga Volcanic Group rocks on the Munduberra sheet and extends south into the northeastern part of the Bondooma 1:100 000 Sheet area.  Outcrop of the unit extends west into the Allies Creek area.|
18404|Toondahra Granite|Lithology|The main part of the unit granite (Rgto) is most commonly fine or fine to medium grained, pink in colour (varying locally to grey or cream), equigranular and leucocratic, containing small amounts (~ 3% or less) of very fine biotite and rarely blue-green hornblende. Chlorite -epidote alteration is common in places. Textures show local variation, ranging from medium to coarse-grained equigranular varieties, to inequigranular varieties with either coarse quartz aggregates or phenocrysts in a finer grained matrix, or feldspar phenocrysts in a microgranitic matrix. In thin section, the granites commonly display well-developed graphic intergrowth textures between quartz and alkali feldspar.  A very fine-grained, locally flow banded porphyritic microgranite phase has been mapped east of Allies Creek (subunit Rgtof). Some of the microgranites east of Allies Creek village display columnar jointing.The granite body east of Allies Creek displays prominent north-south jointing and shearing in places, and is intruded by sporadic massive to flow banded porphyritic rhyolite dykes near its margin. The dykes are also common in the adjacent country rock. In the northeastern part of the BOONDOOMA the unit comprises tor exposure of altered pink granite.  Considerable areas of altered microgranite and rhyolite are present immediately north of Boondooma Dam where they are associated with rhyolitic ignimbrite and dyke swarms of mainly rhyolitic in composition.  These units are probably part of the outlier of the Aranbanga Volcanic Group.  The area east of Manar homestead is composed mainly of intercalated microgranite cut by rhyolite dykes that are locally sparsely porhyritic and strongly flow-banded........... The dykes also locally show a vegetation anomaly; for example at AMG 346839 7112002 a change from mainly Eucalyptus crebra to Callitris is coincident with rubbly outcrop of mariolitic cavities in sparsely k-feldspar-phyric microgranite. Rhyolite dykes intrude brecciated granite containing granite clasts in darker green groundmass are associated with higher magnetic response at AMG 336366, 7119250.Coarse-grained biotite granodiorite forms pavements associated with flow-banded rhyolite at AMG 337927 7116808.  Very fine to medium to coarse granite and biotite microgranite with minor xenoliths occurs at AMG 348431, 7116964...........................Outcrop of a discrete body of relatively fresh tonalite at AMG 338083, 7120980 near Manar homestead comprises mainly quartz and plagioclase (30 and 40 % respectively) with minor K-feldspar (5% untwinned), biotite and hornblende (trace).  The biotite and hornblende are altered to chlorite.  Apatite is a minor accessory.Kaolinised and decomposed granite are present at AMG 327509, 7110838 and 329703, 7114892.  Exposures of light grey to white even grained biotite with minor rhyolite were noted at 329852, 7113906 and 338118 7119923.|
18404|Toondahra Granite|Relationships and boundaries|The unit is intruded by unit Rid, and is probably comagmatic with rhyolite ignimbrite of the Aranbanga Volcanic Group.|
18404|Toondahra Granite|Comments|GEOPHYSICAL EXPRESSION:: The unit has a strong radiometric signature in the ternary K-Th-U image (close to white being high in all channels).  It has a generally low magnetic response in the aeromagnetic data and a generally low magnetic susceptibility.  High magnetic susceptibility associated with the unit is caused by later intrusions of dacite (see unit Rid).MINERLISATION:: Crossing Rocky Creek adjacent to tin workings described by Ball (1903) is on strongly jointed rhyolite at AMG 322523, 7118930.  Along Rocky Creek is a large hill from operations conveyor belts, tyre dump (trucks) mound to 6m; large pits at AMG 165 7119005, mullock heaps along creek westwards for about 200m.  Outcrop of granite, pegmatite and microgranite at AMG 325393.|

18438|Torpedo Creek Quartzite|Unit history|Rocks now mapped as Torpedo Creek Quartzite have previously been assigned to the Gunpowder Creek Formation, Mingera Beds, Judenan Beds, Ploughed Mountain Beds and Myally Beds by Carter & others (1961).|
18438|Torpedo Creek Quartzite|Type section locality|Holostratotype: On Torpedo Creek, approximately 750 m west of the Mammoth Mine to Mount Oxide road at 6758-273321. The section consists of about 120 m of massive, medium-grained white orthoquartzite.|
18438|Torpedo Creek Quartzite|Extent|It crops out extensively in the Mammoth Mines, Kennedy Gap and Mount Oxide 1:100 000 Sheet areas and around the Kamarga dome in the Lawn Hill 1:100 000 Sheet area.|
18438|Torpedo Creek Quartzite|Lithology|The unit is approximately 120 m thick in the type section. Its thickness varies markedly along strike ranging from 0 to 150 m.|
18438|Torpedo Creek Quartzite|Relationships and boundaries|The Torpedo Creek Quartzite is conformably overlain by siltstone of the Gunpowder Creek Formation. The unit unconformably overlies several units, mainly the Surprise Creek Formation, Myally Subgroup, Fiery Creek Volcanics, Carters Bore Rhyolite, Eastern Creek Volcanics and Leander Quartzite. The Torpedo Creek Quartzite is difficult to identify when it concordantly overlies quartzites of the Surprise Creek Formation and Myally Subgroup.|

24534|Townley Formation|Name source|Parish of Townley, County of Gilbert; also Townley Creek, which joins the Gilbert River at GR 7560-462316 and crosses much of the unit.|
24534|Townley Formation|Unit history|White (1965) included the rocks now defined as Townley Formation in his "Etheridge Formation".|
24534|Townley Formation|Geomorphic expression|Variable; ranges from subdued to gently or moderately hilly, generally with differential weathering and erosion picking out fairly well defined lithological layering in many areas, but not as marked as in the Heliman Formation.|
24534|Townley Formation|Type section locality|Along a tributary of Black Gin Creek from its head at GR 7560-290446 downstream to -275448. The section consists of white to grey sericitic or lithic-quartz siltstone and fine sandstone with minor (a few percent) quartzose siltstone and sandstone (cf. Heliman Formation). Blocky-jointed carbonaceous siltstone is common in the middle of the unit. Thickness in the type section is about 1400 m, but is difficult to determine more precisely because of the variable dips.|
24534|Townley Formation|Extent|The formation crops out in a generally northerly trending, strongly folded belt that extends from the Reedy Creek area (GR 7560-300150 approx.) and "North Head" homestead to "Riverview" homestead (GR 7561-310770 approx).|
24534|Townley Formation|Thickness range|The unit ranges from 400 m to about 1500 m thick, but complex folding prevents determination of thickness in many areas, especially in the Mosquito Creek-Mount Clark area.|
24534|Townley Formation|Lithology|Generally as in the type section; the dominant siltstone and fine sandstone are locally carbonaceous, and there is a basal sequence of white laminated sericitic siltstone and sandstone which is locally gossanous in weathered outcrops.|
24534|Townley Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Conformably overlies Robertson River Formation. The base is defined by the change from dominantly carbonaceous siltstone and shale to white to light grey fine sericitic quartz sandstone and siltstone. Conformably overlain by the Heliman Formation which contains a much higher proportion of resistant siliceous beds and is topographically more prominent. Intruded by Forsayth Granite, Gongora and Carnes Granodiorites, Prestwood Microgranite, and several small stocks of Carboniferous microgranodiorite porphyry.|
24534|Townley Formation|Age reasons|Probably mid-Proterozoic; a minimum age of 1570+/-30 m.y. can be inferred from dating in underlying rocks (Robertson River Formation) of a deformation-metamorphism event (Black et al., in press) which has affected the Townley Formation. The unit is intruded by granitic rocks closely similar to the type Forsayth Granite, for which a preliminary isotopic age of 1600 m.y. has been obtained (L P Black, pers. comm., 1978).|

26962|Tungi Creek Granodiorite|Extent|The unit crops out over approximately 110 km2 in an oval shaped area. The western edge is 2 km east of Jimna grid reference.|
26962|Tungi Creek Granodiorite|Lithology|The rock is a medium to coarse-grained, light grey, hornblende-biotite granodiorite.|
26962|Tungi Creek Granodiorite|Relationships and boundaries|The unit intrudes undifferentiated Palaeozoic rocks, undifferentiated Palaeozoic Bunya Phyllite, and Carboniferous to Permian Amamoor Beds.|
26962|Tungi Creek Granodiorite|Age reasons|The unit was dated radiometrically (K/Ar) at 221 m.y. or Early to Middle Triassic. However, because of the proximity to granitic bodies which are in part as old as Late Permian, the age of the Tungi Creek Granodiorite is considered to be Permo-Triassic.|

24052|Turrets Formation|Name source|Parish of Turrets, County of Philp (Clarke River 1:250 000 Cadastral map).|
24052|Turrets Formation|Unit history|Previously mapped as part of the Bundock Creek Formation (now Group) by White (1959, 1962, 1965), and the lowermost part of the 'upper' Bundock Creek Formation by Wyatt & Jell (1980).  The name was first published and described by Withnall & others (1988), but not formally defined.|
24052|Turrets Formation|Geomorphic expression|The thick sandstone units form a series of distinct ridges, separated by more recessive, gullied areas corresponding to the finer grained interbeds.  It is covered by a variety of generally stunted eucalypts.  It contrasts strongly with the subdued topography of the shale-dominated Teddy Mount formation and their mutual boundary is easily photo-interpreted.|
24052|Turrets Formation|Type section locality|.  From 7859 530460 (base) in the Broken River to 518463 (top) in Montgomery Creek, where the unit is 770 m thick.  The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.|
24052|Turrets Formation|Description at type locality|A sinuous folded belt from near 'Gregory Springs' in the southwest to near 'Pandanus Creek' in the northeast. Also in the northwest near 'Oak Valley'.|
24052|Turrets Formation|Thickness range|Up to 840 m on the northern limb of the Boroston Syncline, 560 m on the northern limb of the Montgomery Creek Anticline, and 430 m in the Six Mile Syncline.  It ranges from 100 to 480 m in the Dip Creek Syncline where it onlaps over the Bulgeri Formation onto the Dip Creek Limestone.|
24052|Turrets Formation|Lithology|Feldspathic to lithofeldspathic (locally volcaniclastic) sandstone, mudstone, lesser conglomerate, and reworked tuff, as described in the type section.  The sandstone and conglomerate contain cross-bedding, horizontal planar laminae, parting lineation, bioturbation, rootlets.|
24052|Turrets Formation|Fossils|The unit contains abundant plant remains, mostly of calamitean affinities.|
24052|Turrets Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Conformably overlies the Bulgeri Formation, and is distinguished from the latter by the lack of redbeds.  In the Dip Creek Syncline, the Turrets Formation onlaps the Bulgeri Formation, and unconformably overlies the Dip Creek Limestone of the Broken River Group.  The base is under a unit of white, thick-bedded, pebbly, quartzose sandstone and conglomerate.  The Turrets Formation is conformably overlain by the Teddy Mount Formation, which is distinguished by being more shaley and containing thinner bedded, more widely spaced sandstone beds.  It is intruded by the Carboniferous or ?Permian Montgomery Range Igneous Complex.|25/MAR/08
24052|Turrets Formation|Age reasons|It is probably Famennian in age, because of its stratigraphic position.|

24550|Venetia Formation|Name source|Parish of Venetia, County of Clarke.|
24550|Venetia Formation|Unit history|Previously part of the Clarke River Formation (now Group) (White, 1959).|
24550|Venetia Formation|Type section locality|The holostratotype is located in the ridges north of the Clarke River between GR 997528 (base) and GR 972534 (top). The base is the unconformity with underlying deformed flyschoid sedimentary rocks. The top is identified by the change from predominantly epiclastic to volcaniclastic detritus. In this sequence, which is about 500 m thick, the unit consists mainly of lithofeldspathic gritty sandstones (locally pebbly) which fine up through the sequence into medium to fine-grained micaceous, feldspathic sandstones with minor tuff and siltstone. The sandstones are locally cross-stratified. None of the marine sedimentary rocks has been recognised in th type section. Reference section: The section about 237 m thick exposed along the Clarke River from GR 981477 (base) to GR 969477 (top) is designated as a reference section (parastratotype) for the Venetia Formation. The top is faulted against the Lyall Formation and the base unconformably overlies deformed sedimentary rocks of the Broken River Embayment. Gritty, pebbly sandstone is well exposed in the section. The Marine sedimentary rocks appear to be better developed in the Blue Range area (Wyatt & Jell, 1980), and a reference section eventually could be designated there.|
24550|Venetia Formation|Extent|The Venetia Formation crops out along the northern side of the Clarke River about 40 km southeast of Greenvale. Further north outcrop is restricted to windows within a Tertiary laterite cover. Small outliers also occur to the southeast on Niall Station, to the north in the Gill Creek area, east of Gray Creek near Lucky Springs homestead, and near the junction of Horse and Gray Creeks. The basal part of the sequence in the Blue Range area probably can be assigned to the Venetia Formation although it has not yet been studied in this survey.|
24550|Venetia Formation|Thickness range|The thickness ios difficult to determine because of the irregular open folding. In the type section the formation is about 500 m thick, although some minor repetition by folding is likely.|
24550|Venetia Formation|Lithology|Basal conglomerate; coarse-grined to gritty, poorly sorted lithofeldspathic and quartzose sandstone (locally pebbly); micaceous siltstone; medium to fine-grained, micaceous, feldspathic sandstone; minor tuff. Local marine rocks towards the base of the unit consist of fine-grained sandstone, siltstone and rare limestone.|
24550|Venetia Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The formation is the lower most unit of the Clarke River Group. It unconformably overlies, or is faulted against, deformed flyschoid sedimentary rocks (mainly of Ordovician to Silurian age) of the Broken River Embayment. The basement is distinguished from Clarke River Group by the steep to overturned dips and numerous zones of broken formation. In contrast the Clarke River Group is only weakly deformed; dips are mostly less than 20o. The Venetia Formation is overlain by Lyall Formation (with possible ldisconformity ;and local angular unconformity). The top of the Venetia Formation is defined by the change from micaceous, lithofeldspathic sandstone/siltstone (containing mainly sedimentary lithic clasts) to pebbly sandstones, conglomerates and micaceous, red-green siltstones characterised by the presence of acid volcanic clasts. The Venetia Formation forms the more rugged topography of the Clarke River Basin. Outcrop is plentiful, particularly near the Clarke River. However, it is mainly the coarser, thick-bedded, massive sandstones which crop out. The ridges of the Venetia Formation are generally thickly wooded and have a dark tone on aerial photographs. They can be distinguished from the older Palaeozoic basement rocks which are not as thickly vegetated and are less rugged. Bedding trends and shallow dip slopes of the Venetia Formation are also readily discernable on airphotos.|
24550|Venetia Formation|Age reasons|The Venetia Formation is probably ;mainly Tournaisian in age, but may range from latest Devonian to late Visean (Jell & Playford, in press). A possible hiatus has been suggested near the top of the Venetia Formation, on the basis of microfossil evidence.|

24551|Waddy Point Volcanics|Name source|Waddy Point, on the east coast of Fraser Island, 355390 m, Waddy Point 1:100 000 Sheet area.|
24551|Waddy Point Volcanics|Type section locality|At Waddy Point, the coastal cliffs expose a sequence of 20 m of trachytic lavas overlain by up to 10 m of volcanic agglomerate which is in turn overlain by a further 20 m of lavas. A map and description of the area is presented in Grimes (1977). The volcanics continue below sea level and their base has not been seen. They are overlain by Pleistocene dune sands.|
24551|Waddy Point Volcanics|Extent|Rocky headlands, and a few inland outcrops along a 5 km stretch of coast from Waddy Point south to Indian Head.|
24551|Waddy Point Volcanics|Thickness range|The total thickness is not known as the beds extend below sea level. The volcanics rise to 80 m above sea level and this is taken as the minimum thickness.|
24551|Waddy Point Volcanics|Lithology|The rocks are described in Grimes (1977). Briefly they comprise dark grey and green trachytic lavas with anorthoclase phenocrysts. They are massive or flow banded and often closely jointed parallel to the flow banding. Irregular lenses of agglomerate occur in several places and a bed of agglomerate up to 10 m thick occurs at Waddy Point. This agglomerate is green to red in colour and generally weathered. It contains fragments of the trachytes up to several metres across in a tuffaceous matrix.|
24551|Waddy Point Volcanics|Relationships and boundaries|The base of the un;it has not been seen but is assumed to overlie either Tertiary sediments or the Mesozoic rocks of the Maryborough Basin. The upper boundary is a weathered erosional surface, buried beneath the Pleistocene dunes. They have been intruded by basaltic dykes which have chilled margins.|
24551|Waddy Point Volcanics|Age reasons|The volcanics contain no fossils. Carlson & Wilson (1968) refer to a "basalt" (sic) sample from Middle Rocks which was dated at 32.3 million years (K/Ar method) and three other basalt (sic) samples from the same area ranged from 29.7 to 37.4 m.y. No further details are given but it seems unlikely that sampling would have been restricted to the basalt dykes, and it may well be that 'basalt' is a field name for the dark trachytes. If so the age of the volcanics is Oligocene. This age is in agareement with the age : latitude relationship noted by Wellman and McDougall (1974) for central volcanoes in eastern Australia - the Waddy Point |

27922|Wakeful Metabasalt Member|Type section locality|A section about 300 m thick trending northeast towards an old track 18 km west-southwest of Cloncurry, I.e., near latitude 20o45'S, longitude 140o20'E, GR 6956-309042 to 6956-313046. In the type section there are several flows of massive and amygdaloidal metabasalt, as well as aglomerate with interbeds of fine-grained sandstone.|
27922|Wakeful Metabasalt Member|Extent|The member has been mapped in detail in the Marraba Sheet area, and is continuous across the Bulonga and Duck Creek anticlines; it is known to extend south into the Malbon Sheet area. From the type section south, along the eastern limb of the Duck Creek anticline, a second thin basalt unit is present in the Mitakoodi Quartzite, about 750 m below the Wakeful Metabasalt Member.|
27922|Wakeful Metabasalt Member|Thickness range|Maximum thickness is 340 m in any one sequence of flows.|
27922|Wakeful Metabasalt Member|Lithology|Amygdaloidal and massive metabasalt with sandstone, siltstone, and shale interbeds, and minor agglomerate, silicified sandstone, cherty limestone, and chlorite and magnetic schists. The rocks have been metamorphosed in the greenschist facies.|

19228|Walford Dolomite|Name source|Walford Creek, which drains the eastern portion of the Hedleys Creek 1:100 000 Sheet area, Queensland (Sheet 6562).|
19228|Walford Dolomite|Unit history|Included by Carter (1959) in the 'Wollogorang Formation'; that name is now restricted to a older formation in the Tawallah Group in the McArthur Basin (Roberts et al., 1963). The Walford Dolomite was included in the Fickling Beds of Roberts et al. (1963). These now become the Fickling Group, of which the Walford Dolomite forms the basal unit.|
19228|Walford Dolomite|Type section locality|Over 400 m of dolomite, shale and minor sandstone. The base at GR 860249, 2 km north-northwest of Galena Pits prospect, in the southwestern Hedleys Creek Sheet area; the section runs 2.3 km on a bearing of 170o, and the top is about 200 m south-west of Galena Pits prospect at GR 864228.|
19228|Walford Dolomite|Extent|About 100 km2 in the southwestern Hedleys Creek Sheet area (Qld. = and the adjacent eastern Seigal Sheet area (Northern Territory).|
19228|Walford Dolomite|Thickness range|From 250 m to over 400 m.|
19228|Walford Dolomite|Lithology|In Hedleys Creek a basal member, of limonite concretions and leached shale (originally pyritic?) is overlain by stromatolitic, intraclastic and oolitic dolomite with minor black shale, and glauconitic and dolomitic sandstone. Many of the dolomite exposures are silicified, and a variety of cherts, in which the original textures are preserved, are present.|
19228|Walford Dolomite|Relationships and boundaries|Although sharp, the basal contact with the Fish River Formation appears to be conformable. The upper contact with the Mount Less Siltstone is conformable, and the two units probably intertongue.|
19228|Walford Dolomite|Age reasons|Proterozoic-Carpentarian. Correlation of part of the underlying Peters Creek Volcanics with the Hobblechain Rhyolite Member of the Masterton Formation in the McArthur Basin suggests an age of less than 1575 m.y. (age of the Hobblechain Rhyolite Mbr). Younger age limit provided by 1280 m.y. old dolerites which intrude equivalents of the South Nicholson Group which unconformably overlies the Walford Dolomite.|

26330|Wallabadah Siltstone|Name source|Wallabadah' outstation; GR 7362-410130 (Wallabadah 1:100 0000 Sheet).|
26330|Wallabadah Siltstone|Unit history|Branch (1966) noted the siltstone on his map of the Croydon area as 'white siltstone conformably under rhyodacite' and indicated a thickness for it of 15 m+ at the base of a section of the "Croydon Volcanics".|
26330|Wallabadah Siltstone|Geomorphic expression|The unit occurs in flat or gently undulating terrain mostly covered by alluvium; outcrops are generally creek-bed exposures.|
26330|Wallabadah Siltstone|Type section locality|Because exposures are limited and none represents a complete section, a composite type section is nominated. The uppermost part of the unit is exposed in the bed of Scrubby Creek, beside the Croydon-"Wallabadah" outstation road, at GR 7362-397112, where about 15 m of weathered, well-bedded, quartzose siltstone is conformably overlain by Goat Creek Andesite. A 50 m-long, east-west creek section at GR 7361-488088 exposes about 10-15 m of the middle and lowermost exposed parts of the unit, and is made up of weathered, white to red-brown or purple, thin-bedded to laminated quartzose siltstone and fine sandstone. No base to the unit can be defined because of concealment beneath Tertiary to Quaternary fluviatile sediments.|
26330|Wallabadah Siltstone|Extent|The unit crops out in several places on the southern edge of the Wallabadah 1:100 000 sheet and the northern edge of the adjacent Croydon 1:100 000 Sheet, extending from 3 km southwest to 15 km southeast of 'Wallabadah' outstation.|
26330|Wallabadah Siltstone|Thickness range|The total thickness of the formation is unknown, because the base of the formation is not exposed. Maximum thickness exposed in any one outcrop is not more than 15 m, but maximum total thickness may be 30 m or more.|
26330|Wallabadah Siltstone|Lithology|The siltstone ranges from white to red-brown and purple, and is commonly laminated; in some places it contains interbeds up to 0.3 m thick of massive siltstone which contain sparse, cobble-sized clasts of fine, purple sandstone similar to that in the Langlovale Group. Outcrop of silicified quartzose sandstone and abundant siltstone float were noted at GR 7362-490106.|
26330|Wallabadah Siltstone|Relationships and boundaries|The siltstone is overlain, apparently conformably, by Goat Creek Andesite, and/or by B Creek Rhyolite. Its base is concealed by Tertiary and Quaternary continental sediments.|
26330|Wallabadah Siltstone|Age reasons|The age is Middle Proterozoic (or possibly older), based on the age of the Croydon Volcanic Group.|

24074|Wando Vale Subgroup|Name source|Wando Vale Holding (Clarke River 1.250 000 Cadastral map).|
24074|Wando Vale Subgroup|Unit history|The Subgroup was previously mapped as part of the Broken River Formation (now Group) (White, 1959, 1962, 1965).  The name was first published and described by Withnall & others (1988), but was not formally defined.  It was introduced as an overall name for the interval between the Shield Creek Formation and the Mytton Formation, both of which can be recognised over most of the Graveyard Creek Subprovince, and are relatively uniform lithologically.  However the interval between them, by contrast, is a transgressive sequence with a complexly interfingering range of facies, predominantly limestone, mudstone, and lesser sandstone.  The individual formations which correspond to these facies are generally restricted spatially.  An overall unit to include these formations, and other areas which are as yet unassigned, is both convenient and informative in descriptions of the Broken River Group.|
24074|Wando Vale Subgroup|Constituents|Dosey-Broken River area:: Papilio Mudstone (including  Spanner Limestone	Member), 	Dosey Limestone, Storm Hill Sandstone, Lomandra Limestone, Bracteata Mudstone.Gorge Creek-Diggers Creek area::  Papilio Mudstone,  Burges Formation.Jessey Springs area:: Burges Formation,  Jessey Springs Limestone,.Dip Creek area:: Papilio Mudstone, 	Dip Creek Limestone, Tank Creek Sandstone.Lockup Well area:: Lockup Well Limestone.Pandanus Creek area:: Chinaman Creek Limestone, Tank Creek Sandstone|
24074|Wando Vale Subgroup|Extent|.  A sinuous folded belt up to 3 km wide from near 'Pandanus Creek' in the north, extending about 50 km to 'Dosey' and the Clarke River in the south.  A small, partly fault-bounded area occurs along Catfish Creek northeast of 'Gregory Springs' in the southwest.|
24074|Wando Vale Subgroup|Thickness range|Up to 1200 m.|
24074|Wando Vale Subgroup|Lithology|Limestone, mudstone, labile to quartzose sandstone, and polymictic conglomerate.|
24074|Wando Vale Subgroup|Fossils|The limestone and mudstone units contain rich shallow marine faunas including corals and stromatoporoids, as well as brachiopods, bivalves, gastropods, nautiloids, crinoids, trilobites, bryozoa, ostracods, fish, and conodonts, and algal and vascular plants.|
24074|Wando Vale Subgroup|Relationships and boundaries|Generally overlies the Shield Creek Formation, which consists of feldspathic arenite, with possible disconformity.  West of the Six Mile Syncline, the Shield Creek formation is difficult to recognise, and the Wando Vale Subgroup may lie directly on the Graveyard Creek Group.  Further west it is faulted against the Silurian Dido Tonalite of the Georgetown Province.  In the Dosey area, northwest of Storm Hill, the Wando Vale Subgroup (Storm Hill Sandstone) unconformably overlies the Judea Formation.  In the southwest, near 'Gregory Springs', it unconformably overlies granitoids and metamorphic rocks of the Georgetown Province.  The Wando Vale Subgroup is overlain, apparently conformably, by the Mytton Formation.|
24074|Wando Vale Subgroup|Age reasons|Studies of the corals (Hill in White, 1965; Jell, 1967; Jell in Wyatt & Jell, 1967) and conodonts (Telford, 1975; Mawson, 1987; Mawson & others, 1985; Mawson & Talent, in press and unpublished data) indicate that the Subgroup ranges from Emsian to Givetian in age.  See also the summary in Withnall & others (1988).|

19883|Whitdale Granodiorite|Geomorphic expression|This pluton forms moderately undulating terrain with abundant boulder-sized outcrop in the north of the pluton around Silver Hills homestead.   On Landsat 5 TM images the Whitdale Granodiorite cannot be distinguished from the adjacent Mount Newsome Granodiorite. Magnetic anomalies do not correlate well with the mapped extent of the unit, but the data suggest that the unit is magnetic. Weak to moderate K, and low Th and U responses are associated with the unit.|
19883|Whitdale Granodiorite|Type section locality|At 8451-555016, about 1 km west-southwest of Silver Hills Homestead. The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.|18/MAR/08
19883|Whitdale Granodiorite|Description at type locality|Foliated, porphyritic biotite granodiorite.|
19883|Whitdale Granodiorite|Extent|A north-trending elongate body, 20 km2 in area, centred 2 km south-southwest of Silver Hills homestead.|
19883|Whitdale Granodiorite|Lithology|Grey, foliated and lineated medium to coarse-grained, porphyritic biotite granodiorite, characterised by large, pink alkali feldspar phenocrysts. The tectonic lineation is characterised by the alignment of the alkali feldspar phenocrysts and quartz and biotite.|
19883|Whitdale Granodiorite|Relationships and boundaries|Intrudes the Anakie Metamorphic Group and Gem Park Granite, and appears to be intruded by the Mount Newsome Granodiorite near Silver Hills homestead.  It is unconformably overlain by Late Devonian to Early Carboniferous Silver Hills Volcanics and sedimentary rocks of the Drummond Basin.|
19883|Whitdale Granodiorite|Age reasons|A corrected K-Ar biotite age of 370 Ma was obtained by Webb & McDougall (1968). This age is younger than those of some other units, whereas the strong foliation or lineation in the granite suggests it may be an older part of the batholith. The young age could be the result of resetting by the emplacement of the Mount Newsome Granodiorite.|

27254|White Blow Formation|Name source|White Blow Hill, 15 km northwest of Mary Kathleen town, latitude 20o42'20"S, longitude 139o51'25"E (6856 809100).|
27254|White Blow Formation|Geomorphic expression|Low hills and rises with abundant soil cover.|
27254|White Blow Formation|Type section locality|The proposed type section extends for 1 km in a northwesterly direction from a point 1.5 km southwest of Deighton Pass to the axis of an east-trending syncline, I.e. latitude 20o42'5"S, longitude 139o53'20"E (6856 842107) to latitude 20o41'40"S, longitude 139o53'E (6856 836114). At the base of this section, red-brown medium-grained feldspathic and sericitic sandstone of the Deighton Quartzite is gradationally and conformably overlain by laminated siltstone of the White Blow Formation. The top ;of the formation is defined as the uppermost bed at the synclinal axis. No younger strata are known in the formation. The type section exposes 915 m of sediments which are described by Derrick et al. (1974) as follows (from oldest to youngest):  95 m of grey laminated calcareous and micaceous siltstone and interbedded fine-grained labile sandstone;  240 m of blocky grey laminated limestone, calcareous quartzite and minor black slate;  80 m of grey to black slate with abundant holes resulting from the weathering out of sulphides or porphyroblasts;  120 m of calcareous siltstone, grey slate, and buff fine to medium-grained sandstone;  40 m of blocky medium-grained sandstone; and  350 m of red-brown garnetiferous phyllite and micaceous siltstone.|
27254|White Blow Formation|Extent|The White Blow Formation is exposed over 6 km2 east of White Blow Hill to as far as Deighton Pass, and over a similar area near Cattle Creek, 12 to 18 km south-southwest of Mary Kathleen.|
27254|White Blow Formation|Thickness range|The formation is about 1000 m thick in the Cattle Creek area and 915 m thick in the type section.|
27254|White Blow Formation|Lithology|Micaceous siltstone, phyllite and schist that are locally garnetiferous, and in the Cattle Creek area staurolite-bearing; laminated limestone and scapolitic calcareous biotitic granofels; grey to black slate with rare porphyroblasts of andalusite; and blocky fine to medium-grained quartzite and feldspathic sandstone. The different rock types typically are highly lenticular.|
27254|White Blow Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The White Blow Formation conformably or possibly disconformably overlies the Deighton Quartzite. Local discordant contacts are possibly due to the highly lenticular nature of the underlying Deighton Quartzite, and do not necessarily represent a major tectonic and erosional event. The White Blow Formation may be lithological equivalents of Units B, C, and D in the Surprise Creek Beds (Wilson et al., in prep.). No igneous rocks are known to intrude the Formation.|
27254|White Blow Formation|Age reasons|Precambrian, probably Carpentarian (Middle Proterozoic).|

24571|White Bull Member|Unit history|Included in the upper part of the "Etheridge Formation" by White (1962, 1965).|
24571|White Bull Member|Geomorphic expression|Commonly forms low, rounded ridges that rise above the generally flat terrain on the Candlow Formation. Beds of siliceous siltstone crop out prominently on such ridges, which generally are light in tone on airphotographs. The ridges are commonly grassed with spinifex rather than the more usual long grasses of the area.|
24571|White Bull Member|Type section locality|Within the type section of the Candlow Formation, between GR 7560-234386 (base) and -232384 (top).|
24571|White Bull Member|Extent|From the Gilbert River (about 18o15'S) southward along the valley of Pinnacle Creek, then westward into the valley of the upper Black Gin Creek, then generally southward to the Candlow area and to about 18o50'S in the headwaters of the Langdon River (where it disappears beneath a cover of Mesozoic sandstones) and in the Reedy Creek area (GR 7560-250160).|
24571|White Bull Member|Thickness range|About 200 m in type area; ranges from 100 to 300 m.|
24571|White Bull Member|Lithology|Sericitic siltstone, sublithic fine sandstone, dark grey siliceous siltstone, carbonaceous siltstone, minor quartzose sandstone, and shale. Predominantly sericitic siltstone and dark grey siliceous siltstone in type area.|
24571|White Bull Member|Relationships and boundaries|A mappable sub-unit in the lower part of the Candlow Formation. Distinguished by the relative abundance of hard, prominently outcropping dark grey siliceous siltstone and consequent relative topographic prominence. Intruded by Forest Home Granodiorite.|

29274|White Springs Granodiorite|Unit history|Mapped as Forsayth Granite by White (1959, 1962c, 1965).|
29274|White Springs Granodiorite|Type section locality|Along the Georgetown-Mt Surprise road northeast from the eastern scarp of the Newcastle Range between 943 733 and 046 806. In this area the unit consists mainly of medium even grained to slightly porphyritic biotite granodiorite. Muscovite-biotite granodiorite grading into muscovite leucogranite crops out east of Nigger Creek.|
29274|White Springs Granodiorite|Extent|Two separate areas east and west of the Newcastle Rnage in the central part of the Georgetown 1:100 000 Sheet area. The western area extends from O'Brien Creek to the Newcastle Range escarpment and the eastern area from the western side of the range along White Springs Creek to within one kilometre of McMillan Creek.|
29274|White Springs Granodiorite|Lithology|Mainly medium, even grained to slightly porphyritic biotite granodiorite with some more leucocratic medium grained porphyritic muscovite-biotite granite and granodiorite. The leucocratic, porphyritic varieties are mostly restricted to the southeast between White Springs and McMillan Creeks.|
29274|White Springs Granodiorite|Relationships and boundaries|Intrusive into Proterozoic Einasleigh Metamorphics and Talbot Creek Granodiorite (new name). Muscovite leucogranites intrude the biotite granodiorite locally ;but elsewhere grade into muscovite-biotite granodiorite and granite. Some of these muscovite leucogranites may be related to the Digger Creek Granite but are probably more likely to be a late stage marginal phase of the White Springs Granodiorite. Unconformably overlain by the Carboniferous Newcastle Range Volcanics and intruded by rhyolite and andesite dykes realted to the volcanics.|
29274|White Springs Granodiorite|Age reasons|Proterozoic; Rb/Sr dating of muscovite from a sample collected 16 km west of "Eveleigh" Homestead gave a minimum age of 1085 million years; biotite from the same sample gave 414 million years indicating resetting (Black, 1973).|

19936|Whitula Formation|Lithology|Interbedded friable quartzose sandstone, laminer siltstone, mudstone and claystone, minor conglomerate; lignitic and gypsiferous in part. The sandstones vary from white to red-brown in colour and the argillaceous beds are grey, black, sometimes yellow or pink. Indurated layers due to slight silicification or ferruginisation are present throughout. Thin gypsum beds are numerous, and on resistivity logs of drill holes, are correlatable over large distances (Senior, 1971).|
19936|Whitula Formation|Fossils|Core samples examined for spores and pollens were devoid of organic material probably due to contemporaneous oxidation.|

(1963), in the Calvert Hills 1:250 000 Sheet area, NT. The Westmoreland Conglomerate is the basal sedimentary unit in the McArthur Basin, and is separated from the Wire Creek Sandstone, the basal unit of the 'Lawn Hill Platform', by a belt of basement rocks. This belt probably formed a topographic high during deposition in both basins, and it is likely that units in the two basins were never connected.|
20288|Wire Creek Sandstone|Type section locality|A small gorge where Wire Creek intersects the unit. The base is at GR 907367, Hedleys Creek 1:100 000 Sheet area, and the section extends east-southeastwards along Wire Creek for a distance of 1 km.|

20316|Withersfield Quartz Syenite|Geomorphic expression|The Withersfield Quartz Syenite forms highly dissected terrain with steep-sided ridges, a relief of over 100 m, and abundant outcrop.   On the Landsat 5 TM (1-4-7 BGR) image, the Withersfield Quartz Syenite is a well-defined oval body, red-brown in colour with high relief. It is strongly magnetic. U is uniformly high, but K and Th have variable response; they are high over most of the pluton, but are low along the southern margin.|
20316|Withersfield Quartz Syenite|Type section locality|At 8351-538015 on the southeastern margin of the pluton. The grid reference is based on the AGD66 datum.|18/MAR/08
20316|Withersfield Quartz Syenite|Description at type locality|Pink, fine to medium-grained, equigranular hornblende-biotite quartz syenite.|
20316|Withersfield Quartz Syenite|Extent|A northwest-trending oval pluton, 6 km long by 4 km wide, centred 5 km west of Silver Hills homestead, and intruding sedimentary units of the Drummond Basin.|
20316|Withersfield Quartz Syenite|Lithology|Pink, fine to medium-grained, equigranular hornblende-biotite quartz syenite and quartz monzonite. The geophysical data suggest that the pluton is composite. Because the pluton largely lies outside the Anakie Inlier in the Drummond Basin sedimentary rocks, it was only briefly examined. Subsequent work by geologists from Billiton (Australia) Pty Ltd indicate that the pluton includes quartz monzonite as well as quartz syenite.|
20316|Withersfield Quartz Syenite|Relationships and boundaries|The Withersfield Quartz Syenite intrudes the Late Devonian to Early Carboniferous Telemon Formation, Raymond Sandstone and Mount Hall Formation. Two small outcrop areas of olivine gabbro and dolerite within the pluton are possibly related to Tertiary basalt flows that overlie the pluton.|
20316|Withersfield Quartz Syenite|Age reasons|Webb & McDougall (1968) obtained corrected ages of 287 to 306 Ma, by K-Ar dating of biotite and hornblende. The unit is therefore probably Late Carboniferous.|

24583|Wonnemarra Rhyolite|Name source|The name Wonnemarra is derived from the Parish of Wonnemarra, County of Esmeralda; Georgetown, Queensland 1:250 000 series cadastral sheet.|
24583|Wonnemarra Rhyolite|Unit history|Branch (1966), included the Wonnemarra Rhyolite in the "Croydon Volcanics" (undivided), although he did note the presence of a basal "sheet" in the east, made up of grey, rhyolitic to rhydacitic rocks probably equivalent to the Wonnemarra, B Creek, and Carron Rhyolites. The unit was informally named and described as 'Wonnemarra rhyolite' by Mackenzie (1983).|
24583|Wonnemarra Rhyolite|Geomorphic expression|Like the Idalia Rhyolite, The Wonnemarra Rhyolite is characterised by moderate, commonly rocky relief, subdued to steep slopes and sparse vegetation cover. Its soil cover is a little darker than that of the Carron Rhyolite.|
24583|Wonnemarra Rhyolite|Type section locality|The type section of the unit extends from GR 7460-055280, near Snake Creek mine, where the lower contact is faulted, but is very close to the base, southwestward to -045276 (top). The section consists of massive, blue-grey to green-grey, medium-grained, moderately crystal-rich rhyolitic ignimbrite containing sparsely scattered, rounded pellets of graphite up to 5 mm long; its thickness is about 500 m. The base of the unit is faulted here, but elsewhere it unconformably overlies low-grade metasediments of the Middle Proterozoic Etheridge and Langlovale Groups. Its top is marked by an abrupt transition into dark grey, fine-grained, crystal-poor rhyolitic ignimbrite and sparsely porphyritic, flow-banded rhyolite of the Carron Rhyolite.|
24583|Wonnemarra Rhyolite|Extent|The Wonnemarra Rhyolite crops out as a curved, discontinuous lens, extending from GR 7460-074393 14 km southward to -057250, in the Dingo Creek-Snake Creek area.|
24583|Wonnemarra Rhyolite|Thickness range|The unit varies considerably in thickness, which is difficult to estimate because of the lack of dip indicators, but probably ranges between 450 m and 800 m over most of its strike length.|
24583|Wonnemarra Rhyolite|Lithology|Like the Idalia Rhyolite, the Wonnemarra Rhyolite consists of medium greenish to bluish-grey, medium-grained, moderately crystal-rich rhyolitic ignimbrite, containing 10 to 20 percent by volume crystals (or crystal fragments) of quartz, K-feldspar, and sericitised plagioclase, and up to 5 percent variably chloritised biotite. Fayalite, variably altered to chlorite or bowlingite, or replaced by green biotite and magnetite, is commonly present (up to 1%), and graphite, generally as rounded pellets, up to 5 mm across is present in trace amounts. The rock is extensively recrystallised near the Dregger Granite.|
24583|Wonnemarra Rhyolite|Relationships and boundaries|The Wonnemarra Rhyolite appears to unconformably overlie rocks of the Proterozoic Etheridge and Langlovale Groups in places (north of Snake Creek), and is faulted against them in others. It is conformably overlain by the Carron Rhyolite, another formation of the Croydon Volcanic Group, from which it is distinguished primarily by its more abundant, larger crystals. It is intruded and, in part, recrystallised and hornfelsed by the Dregger Granite, and is unconformably overlain in places by Jurassic Hampstead Sandstone and Tertiary to Quaternary continental sediments.|
24583|Wonnemarra Rhyolite|Age reasons|The Wonnemarra Rhyolite is considered to be of Middle Proterozoic age (about 1400 +/- 75 Ma; Black, 1973), the same as the Idalia Rhyolite.|

26233|Woolshed Mountain Granodiorite|Lithology|Cranfield & others (1976) described the granodiorite as a pale pinkish-grey, mottled by dark biotite flakes, medium to coarse-grained, holocrystalline, and hypidiomorphic granular.  Petrography:: Thin section constituents are zoned plagioclase (andesine), with sericite alteration, quartz, orthoclase, and biotite, together with minor hornblende, magnetite, epidote, clinozoisite, and chlorite.  Accessories include zircon, apatite, and allanite.  The plagioclase is of two generations: the earlier generation is coarser-grained, minutely oscillatory zoned, and saussuritised (oligoclase to andesine in composition); the later generation is fresh unzoned andesine.  Orthoclase is perthitic, and has reacted with biotite to form iron oxides, and myrmekitic and wormlike intergrowths. Quartz forms anhedral grains. Biotite is pleochroic brown to green, is altered to epidote and chlorite, and has inclusions of wedge- shaped crystals of allanite and euhedral zircon. Hornblende is blue- green, sub- hedral, and constitutes approximately 1 per cent of the rock. Apatite typically occurs as inclusions in plagioclase.  In the current mapping thin section from AMG 404469 7011358, contained biotite and hornblende (locally twinned) that have minor metamict textures and minor alteration to chlorite.  There was no apparent difference in rock type from the magnetic and non-magnetic pats of the unit.|30/NOV/09
26233|Woolshed Mountain Granodiorite|Relationships and boundaries|The unit intrudes the Sugarloaf Metamorphics and is intruded by the Djuan Tonalite.  Cranfield & others (1976) reported intrusions of spherulitic rhyolite dykes and a basic dyke within this unit.  East west trending rhyolite dykes up to 5m wide appear to be offset by minor faulting at AMG 405980 7012470.  Scott (1963) reported the contact between the Djuan Tonalite and Woolshed Mountain Granodiorite is gradational, and can be distinguished as a mixed phase over less than 15m. Contact metamorphism of the country rock by the granodiorite is not pronounced.  The unit is unconformably overlain by Main Range Volcanics and Tertiary sediments in the north on NANANGO and by a small area of Main Range Volcanics at Woolshed Mountain on ESK.  A small area of Woolshed Mountain Granodiorite was recorded within the Djuan Tonalite at AMG 402000 7007300.|30/NOV/09
26233|Woolshed Mountain Granodiorite|Age reasons|The Woolshed Mountain Granodiorite was initially assigned a radiometric (K/Ar) age of 253 +/- 8 Ma.  This was recalculated to 258.2 +/- 8 Ma (Late Permian) by Day & others (1983).|30/NOV/09
26233|Woolshed Mountain Granodiorite|Geophysical Expression|The RTP magnetic image shows a general low response over the Woolshed Mountain Granodiorite.  However the south and southeast part of the body has a higher response, possibly indicating that the Djuan Tonalite occurs beneath the granodiorite in this area. At AMG 404867 7013056, in the area of low magnetic response on the image, magnetic susceptibility readings average 31 x 10-5SI units. At AMG 404469 7011358, in the area of higher magnetic response on the image, magnetic susceptibility readings average 436 x 10-5SI units.  The radiometric image shows distinct pink tones for the area of outcrop of the Woolshed Mountain Granodiorite which contrast well with the darker response of the Djuan Tonalite and the lighter response of the Sugarloaf Metamorphics.|30/NOV/09

27306|Woonigan Granite|Name source|Named after Woonigan railway siding on the main Mount Isa to Townsville railway line, about 25 km NW of Duchess, Duchess 1:100 000 Sheet area (Duchess 1:250 000 Sheet area).|
27306|Woonigan Granite|Unit history|Previously mapped as Kalkadoon Granite and Leichhardt Metamorphics (Carter & Opik, 1963).|
27306|Woonigan Granite|Type section locality|About 5.5 to 6 km NE of Woonigan railway siding, from about GR 687599 to GR 704591, in area drained by unnamed tributaries of Alligator Creek. In this area the unit consists of mainly medium to coarse-grained, even-grained to sparsely porphyritic, leucocratic biotite granite, together with minor finer grained leucocratic, porphyritic biotite granite adjacent to some contacts with country rocks.|
27306|Woonigan Granite|Extent|The granite crops out as small discrete plutons and pods on the margins of the Kalkadoon Granite belt on the Duchess 1:100 000 Sheetarea. It is most extensively exposed NE of Woonigan railway siding.|
27306|Woonigan Granite|Lithology|The main rock types present in the larger bodies are non-foliated, coarse to fine, even-grained to slightly porphyritic biotite leucogranite and leucocratic porphyritic biotite microgranite. Many small lpods and marginal zones of the larger plutons comprise mainly non-foliated leucocratic porphyritic microgranite containing quartz and feldspar phenocrysts in a fine-grained groundmass containing small scattered aggregates of biotite grains. In a few places relatively thick (10-15 m) veins of leucogranite intrude Kalkadoon Granite and are characterised by fairly strongly foliated (foliation generally parallel to contacts) marginal zones containing small feldspar and quartz phenocrysts in a fine-grained groundmass, and coarser, more even-grained central parts. However, many leucogranite veins assumed to be related to the Woonigan Granite are non-foliated and even-grained.|
27306|Woonigan Granite|Relationships and boundaries|The Woonigan Granite intrudes Kalkadoon Granite and Leichhardt Volcanics. It is cut by numerous non-foliated to foliated amphibolitic metadolerite dykes, many of which show relict igneous textures, and by scattered dykes of grey, porphyritic granophyre (which also cut Leichhardt Volcanics).|

33431|Wooroolin Granite|Lithology|The unit is dominated by leucocratic, pink, medium to locally fine grained, equigranular biotite granite.  The biotite occurs as discrete plates scattered throughout the rock.  Blocky aplitic phases occur locally.  Potassic and limonitic alteration of the granite is widepread and fresh exposure is rare.  The granite is intruded by a network of shallow dipping aplite veins and occasional thick basalt dykes.|30/NOV/09
33431|Wooroolin Granite|Relationships and boundaries|The granite intrudes the Devonian to Carboniferous Maronghi Creek beds and their probable metamorphosed equivalents, the Fifer Creek Metamorphics.  The relationship between the lithologically different Stuart River and Hivesville Granites to the north is unknown, although the Wooroolin Granite may be co-genetic with the latter.  The Wooroolin Granite is locally overlain by silicified Tertiary sandstones and lateritised basalt flows of the Main Range Volcanics (and intruded by related basalt dykes).|30/NOV/09
33431|Wooroolin Granite|Age reasons|The unit has yielded a 274+/-28Ma Rb/Sr whole rock age and a 258.2 Ma K/Ar biotite age from a site 5km south-west of Memerambi (Webb & McDougall, 1968). These dates are nominally of Permian age, but the imprecision of the error bar on the Rb/Sr age makes it possible that the granite ranges up into the Late Triassic.|30/NOV/09

24588|Wyandotte Formation|Name source|Wyandotte Creek/Wyandotte Station; GR 773198 Conjuboy 1:100 000 Sheet (7860).|
24588|Wyandotte Formation|Type section locality|Exposed on the western bank of Wyandotte Creek at approx. 7860 773198 (18o40'45"S 144o50'20"E). 5 m of partially indurated blue-grey muds, gravels, sandy gravels and well sorted sands overlying orange-brown basement regolith. Modern soils (black and loamy) cap and obscure the nature of the upper boundary.|
24588|Wyandotte Formation|Extent|The unit is exposed in ribbon-like aspect along the course of Wyandotte Creek for approx. 10 km upstream of the junction with Dry River on Wyandotte Station. Distribution beyond Wyandotte Creek is unknown at present.|02/APR/12
24588|Wyandotte Formation|Thickness range|Never more than 15 metres.|
24588|Wyandotte Formation|Lithology|Two distinctive lithofacieas associations. The lower association (Unit A) is 2-3 m thick and sits unconformably on basement regolith. It consists of a basal granule gravel 10-5 cm thick and an overlying massive blue-grey clay containing flecks of carbonised plant material 1-10 mm in diameter. Lenticular granule gravel stringers 1-20 m in length occur within the massive blue-grey clay. In-situ occurrences of disarticulated bones and teeth are noted for the basal and lenticular granule gravels but not for the massive blue-grey clay. Unit B lithofacies association overlies Unit A but in some outcrops lies directly on basement. It fines upwards from a basal cobble to boulder gravel 15-75 cm thick into crossbedded fine-medium sands and  laminated to crosslaminated sands up to 2 m thick. Minor silt and mud drapes 1-10cm thick above the gravel bed also outcrop along section. The contact between Units A & B is erosional. It represents the erosion of typical vertical accretion facies of Unit A by stream channel action depositing the classic lateral accretion facies of Unit B. Units A & B represent different depositional regimes within the one depositional system. Unit B is capped by loamy to black soil containing basalt boulders. The upper boundary is obscure but in many places appears gradational. In-situ disarticulated bones and teeth are noted for the basal gravel and the gravelly sands directly above the basal gravel. Other lithofacies found elsewhere and not represented in the type section are a grey diatomaceous clay facies that occurs within both units and a chocolate brown flecked clay facies that occurs as a vertical accretion equivalent to Unit B.  Unit B also shows areas of patchy carbonate cement (mainly near the type section) and lenticular concentrations of gastropod and bivalve debris.|02/APR/12
24588|Wyandotte Formation|Fossils|Vertebrate fossil fauna: Unit A: undet Teleost fish; undet Chelid turtles; Meiolania cf platyceps; Megalania prisca; undet Varanid lizard/s; undet Elapid snakes(2); undet Ziphodont crocodile/s; Pallimnarchus pollens/Crocodylus porosus; undet Anatid birds; Anas sp.; Anseranus semipalmata; undet Palorchestid diprotodontid/s; undet Zygomaturine diprotodontid; Macropus sp.; Rattus sp.; Isoodon macrorous; and Antechinus sp..

Fauna not in-situ: Wonambi cf naracoortensis; Diprotodon optatum; ?Eowenia sp.; Phascolonus cf gigas; and Dasyurus sp..|02/APR/12
24588|Wyandotte Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Overlies basement granitoids and metamorphics of Proterozoic and ?Palaeozoic age (Griffin, 1977), their lateritised equivalents, lateritised sediments and other indurated sediments of unassigned age and regolith. It occurs within a broad valley bounded to the south by a narrow basalt flow and to the north by basement outcrop. The palaeovalley that accreted the sediments is essentially coincident with the valley occupied by the modern-day creek. The modern creek is eroding and exposing the older fill within this valley.|
24588|Wyandotte Formation|Age reasons|The basalt flow forming the southern margin of the Wyandotte valley is perched on the topographic high point between the Dry River to the south and Wyandotte Creek to the north. This flow is dated at 410,000 ybp (Griffin, 1977) and fills a narrow channel cut into unassigned age (post laterite) sediments and other basement rocks. The broad valley now containing the Wyandotte Formation could only have begun eroding after the basalt filled the earlier channel and reorganised the drainage. Carbon from the basal gravels of Unit A submitted for C-14 dating proved to be beyond range (>45,000 ybp). Given that the valley did not begin forming until after 410,000 ybp it seems likely that the base of Unit A is no older than 200,000 ybp. Bivalve shell from the base of Unit B returned a C-14 date of 30,400 ybp. The Wyandotte Formation is therefore a Late Pleistocene accumulation, a fact reflected by the typical Late Pleistocene nature of the vertebrate fossil fauna.|

20695|Wyandra Sandstone Member|Type section locality|The type section lies between 1170' (356 m) and 1225' (373 m) in water bore no. 2049 (QIWSC records) which is located 15 km northeast of Wyandra town (27o10'10"E, Long. 146o5'30"N).|
20695|Wyandra Sandstone Member|Extent|Widespread in the cental part of the Eromanga Basin in Queensland, and extends into northeast South Australia and northwest New South Wales.|
20695|Wyandra Sandstone Member|Thickness range|Range from 3 to 18 m, with variations occurring gradually over considerable distances.|
20695|Wyandra Sandstone Member|Lithology|Medium to coarse grained quartzose to sublabile sandstone with scattered pebbles and carbonate cement. Driller's lithological logs of water bores regard it as 'sandrock' or 'sandstone'. The sandstone is porous and permeable and stratigraphically is the highest major aquifer in the Great Artesian Basin.|
20695|Wyandra Sandstone Member|Depositional environment|This widespread sandstone overlies the paralic Cadna-owie Formation is very consistent in thickness and may well be a beach sand representing the widespread Lower Cretaceous marine transgression.|
20695|Wyandra Sandstone Member|Relationships and boundaries|The member forms the upper part of the Cadna-owie Formation in much of the Eromanga Basin, and is conformably overlain by the Doncaster Mudstone.|
20695|Wyandra Sandstone Member|Age reasons|Spores a microplankton of Evan's (1966) spore division Kla were recovered from BMR Eulo 1 (Core 3) in the Eulo Ridge area (Senior, 1971).

20695|Wyandra Sandstone Member|Comments|Notes: This Member was formerly included and described as a sandstone bed within the informal division "Upper Hooray Sandstone". The "Upper Hooray Sandstone" is laterally continuous with the Cadna-owie Formation as defined by Freytak et al (1967). The name Cadna-owie Formation is adopted and the Wyandra Sandstone Member is a new name to define the prominent sandstone bed at the top of this Formation. The member is readily interpreted on gamma-ray logs at water bores and wireline logs of petroleum exploration wells and by this means can be correlated over large distances.|

20835|Yappo Member|Name source|Named after Yappo Creek, the headwaters of which drain part of the outcrop area in the Duchess and Oban 1:100 000 Sheet areas (Duchess and Urandangi 1:250 000 Sheet areas).|
20835|Yappo Member|Unit history|Mapped mainly as Mount Guide by Carter & Opik (1963), and included as part of the Rifle Creek beds (informal name) by Bultitude & others (1977).|
20835|Yappo Member|Type section locality|From GR 449769 to GR 486754, about 3 km N of Mount Guide, in the NW corner of the Duchess 1:100 000 Sheet area. Here the member consists mainly of grey pebbly metagreywacke, and metagreywacke conglomerate and grit, together with minor meta-arkose, and labile, sericitic, feldspathic, and quartzose meta-arenite and quartzite containing heavy mineral-rich laminae.|
20835|Yappo Member|Extent|The member is exposed in N-trending belts and forms undulating to hilly country in the W parts of the Duchess and Dajarra and the E parts of the adjoining Ardmore and Oban 1:100 000 Sheet areas.|
20835|Yappo Member|Thickness range|The Yappo Member displays marked thickness variations. In the Duchess 1:100 000 Sheet area it is about 3750 m thick in the type section, locally less than 100 m thick in the central west, and about 700 m thick in the SW.|
20835|Yappo Member|Lithology|The rocks are generally as in the type section. Locally, meta-arkose and conglomeratic meta-arkose are common to predominant rock types. Other, less abundant rock types present locally are sericite schist, muscovite-biotite schist, metasiltstone, epidotic quartzite, metabasalt and pink to grey? felsic tuff. The unit has undertone greenschist to amphibolite grade regional metamorphism, and a N-trending axial plane cleavage or schistosity is present in many areas.|
20835|Yappo Member|Relationships and boundaries|The Yappo Member overlies the Bottletree Formation, apparently conformably. Both units contain similar sedimentary rock types, the arbitrary boundary ;between them being placed so as to exclude all but very thin possible felsic metavolcanic units from the Yappo Member. The Yappo Member has a gradational contact wioth the overlying upper member of the Mount Guide Quartzite, the boundary being placed at the marked topographic break between undulating and hilly terrain formed on the Yappo Member and upstanding ridges formed on the overlying meta-arenites and quartzites. The formation is cut by rare quartz-feldspar porphyry dykes, by a small quartz-feldspar body tentatively assigned to the Garden Creek Porphyry, and by numerous dykes and small pods of amphibolitic metadolerite.|
20835|Yappo Member|Identifying features|Definition: In the Duchess and Urandangi 1:250 000 Sheet areas, two units have been delineated within the Mount Guide Quartzite as defined by Carter & others (1961). The basal unit is characterised by an abundance of regionally metamorphosed greywacke, greywacke conglomerate and grit, and arkose, and is defined as the Yappo Member. The overlying sequence of mainly meta-arenite and quartzite forming the upper part of the Mount Guide Quartzite has not been formally named.|
20835|Yappo Member|Age reasons|Precambrian. The member overlies the Bottletree Formation provisionally dated at about 1800 m.y. (R W Page, BMR, personal communication, 1980).|
20835|Yappo Member|Proposed publication|Blake & others, in preparation.|
20835|Yappo Member|Comments|Remarks: The Yappo Member is equivalent to the lower part of the Mount Guide Quartzite as defined by Carter & others (1961) but, as the unit contains very little quartzite and is radily mappable, it has been referred to a separate member. The unit is equivalent to most of the lower Mount Guide Quartzite mapped in sheet areas to the N (Derrick & others, 1976).|

26242|Yardida Tillite|Lithology|Light to dark green-grey diamictite and laminated siltstone with infrequent fine to very coarse grained brown to grey sandstone and arkose, rarely pebbly. Locally at the top there is at least 102 m of dark grey, laminated, dolomitic shale with, in its lower half, abundant lenses of dolomite (in BMR Hay River No. 10, Adam Special 1:100 000 Geological Sheet).|20/DEC/06
26242|Yardida Tillite|Relationships and boundaries|The unit overlies the Yackah Beds with inferred disconformity and is disconformably overlain by red arkose, siltstone and shale of the Black Stump Arkose (Walter, 1979). The top of the unit is taken at the base of the overlaying red-brown sequence; this can be difficult to locate precisely, as in BMR Hay River No. 7 (Adam Special 1:100 000 Geological Sheet).

24594|Yarman Formation|Extent|Exposed along an unnamed taributary of the upper Langdon River from GR 7460-102168 to -068139, in a crudely triangular area in the upper Langdon River drainage with "corners" at GR 7460-056237, -077227, and -167189, and in a small area near the Langdon River centred on GR 7461-075542 (Esmeralda and Gilbert River 1:100 000 Sheet areas).|
24594|Yarman Formation|Thickness range|At least 1800 m; top is not exposed.|
24594|Yarman Formation|Lithology|Dark grey, weathering to marooon or red-brown, laminated, thin bedded, or massive shale with lesser amounts of finely interbedded fine to medium-grained siltstone; 1 cm to 1 m-thick beds of fine to medium-grained, commonly cross-bedded micaceous sublithic sandstone, making up about 5 to 10 percent of the total thickness, are distributed throughout the unit.|
24594|Yarman Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Conformably overlies Malacura Sandstone, where predominant sandstones are succeeded by predominant maroon or red-brown-weathering shale and siltstone. Unconformably overlain by or faulted against Croydon Volcanics and unconformably overlain by Mesozoic sandstone; top is not exposed. Intruded by Esmeralda Granite.|
24594|Yarman Formation|Age reasons|Early upper Proterozoic. Rocks underlying the Yarman Formation and Malacura Sandstone have been affected by deformation and metamorphism, dated at 1570 +/- 30 m.y.

Rocks exposed in this area are mainly grey, medium even-grained hornblende-biotite granodiorite with some pink hornblende-biotite granite, both intruded by minor fine even-grained biotite granite.|
26245|Yataga Granodiorite|Extent|A circular stock, 9 km in diameter, about 30 km north-northeast of Georgetown.|
26245|Yataga Granodiorite|Lithology|Mainly grey hornblende-biotite granodiorite and tonalite; subsidiary finer grained grey to pink biotite granite. The last probably intrudes the granodiorite in the central part of the stock. Veins and small dykes of pink aplite cut the granodiorite and granite locally.|
26245|Yataga Granodiorite|Relationships and boundaries|Intrudes, and has strongly hornfelsed, the Proterozoic Robertson River Metamorphics and Mistletoe Granite.|
26245|Yataga Granodiorite|Age reasons|Late Palaeozoic (Permian or Carboniferous) intrusive rocks of Permian and Carboniferous age with similar mineralogy are common in northeastern Queensland, e.g. Hammonds Creek Granodiorite, Bakerville Granodiorite, Kalunga Granodiorite, Almaden Granite, and various phases of the Herbert River Granite (Sheraton & Labonne, in press). A K/Ar date on a sample of biotite from the Yataga Granodiorite gave an age of 262 million years.|

20928|Yeldham Granite|Name source|Parish of Yeldham between latitudes 18o33'S and 18o48'S and longitudes 138o05'E and 139o05'E in the Lawn Hill and Gregory Downs 1:100 000 Sheet areas.|
20928|Yeldham Granite|Unit history|The Yeldham Granite has been previously referred to as the Weberra Granite by Carter, Brooks & Walker (1961), and Cavaney (1975). The Weberra Granite is defined in the Alhambra area in the Mount Oxide 1:100 000 Sheet area, which is 60 km to the southeast of the Yeldham Granite. These granite masses are of different chemistry and petrology (Wyborn, pers. comm.) and have no common contact.|
20928|Yeldham Granite|Geomorphic expression|The granite crops out as low relief platforms and broad hills with rarely more than 50 metres relief.|
20928|Yeldham Granite|Type section locality|The type locality of the Yeldham Granite is nominated to lie approximately 100 metres to the southeast of the road connecting Rankins Yard to Gregory Downs approximately 18 km due south of the Lawn Hills to Gregory Downs road (GR LH 773230). It is situated 21 km southwest of Yeldham Station.|
20928|Yeldham Granite|Extent|The Yeldham Granite crops out as several bodies in the faulted core of a large dome in the eastern part of the Lawn Hill 1:100 000 Sheet area. The largest of these bodies crops out over 8 km2 in the core of the Kamarga Dome. The dome is cut by a prominent faulting causing displacement of the granite.|
20928|Yeldham Granite|Lithology|The rock is an equigranular, medium-grained, pink-grey, muscovite granite. Grain size varies between 1 mm and 6 mm but averages 1-2 mm. Adjacent to the margin of the pluton, some hornblende is present. Other lithologies within the pluton are coarse-grained pegmatite, greisen and large graphitic quartz-hematite xenoliths.|20/AUG/09
20928|Yeldham Granite|Relationships and boundaries|The pluton intrudes the Kamarga Volcanics and is nonconformably overlain by the McNamara Group.|
20928|Yeldham Granite|Age reasons|The age of the Yeldham Granite is unknown. It is overlain nonconformably by equivalents of the Mount Isa Group which has been isotopically dated at between 1650 m.y. and 1670 m.y. (Page, 1979).|

24599|Yellow Waterhole Granite|Name source|Named after Yellow Waterhole, GR 558865, 3 km to S of the granite outcrop area, Selwyn 1:100 000 Sheet area, Duchess 1:250 000 Sheet area.|
24599|Yellow Waterhole Granite|Unit history|Like all other granites in the eastern part of the Duchess 1:250 000 Sheet area, the Yellow Waterhole Granite was mapped as Williams Granite by Carter & Opik (1963).|
24599|Yellow Waterhole Granite|Type section locality|Tors and spheroidal boulders of pink, non-foliated, weakly porphyritic, medium to coarse biotite granite at GR 533910, close to the Selwyn/Hamilton River road 29 km SSE of Selwyn.|
24599|Yellow Waterhole Granite|Extent|The unit crops out as elongate body 19 km long and up to 2.5 km wide trending E in SW Selwyn and SE Mount Merlin 1:100 000 Sheet areas, Duchess 1:250 000 Sheet area.|
24599|Yellow Waterhole Granite|Lithology|The unit consists of massive (non-foliated), even-grained to porphyritic, fine to coarse biotite granite and hornblende-biotite granite, and minor aplite.|
24599|Yellow Waterhole Granite|Relationships and boundaries|The granite intrudes Kuridala Formation and is overlain by flat-lying Mesozoic sediments.|
24599|Yellow Waterhole Granite|Age reasons|Proterozoic|
24599|Yellow Waterhole Granite|Comments|Remarks: Yellow Waterhole Granite forms a well-defined intrusive body strongly oblique to northerly trends of adjacent country rocks. It is probably closely related to the petrographically similar Squirrel Hills Granite (new name) to the east, and belongs to the Williams Batholith (new structural term).|
