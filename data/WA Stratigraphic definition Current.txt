24150|Airport Creek Formation|Name source|Airport Creek; mouth of creek grid reference 121817, Derby 1:250 000 sheet.|
24150|Airport Creek Formation|Type section locality|3 metres of partly indurated laminated sediment is exposed along banks and at the mouth of Airport Creek.  The top is in sharp contact with a grey soil unit called Double Nob Formation;  the base is not exposed.|
24150|Airport Creek Formation|Extent|The unit is exposed along banks of Airport Creek, Doctors Creek and low tide zones near Derby.  Total outcrop and subsurface distribution is in excess of 200 km2. |
24150|Airport Creek Formation|Thickness range|8 metres plus;  determined by coring under Derby Jetty;  base not reached.|
24150|Airport Creek Formation|Lithology|Interlayered grey to buff calcareous and siliciclastic laminates, sandstone and sponge spicules in the sandstones.|
24150|Airport Creek Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Basal relationships not accurately known; on shore the unit overlies Mowanjum Sands, as determined by augering at grid reference 123822, Derby Sheet area 1:250 000.  The unit is overlain by Double Nob Formation (soil) with gradational contact and locally by Doctors Creek Formation with sharp contact.|
24150|Airport Creek Formation|Age reasons|Criteria of unconformity, weathering features and overlying soil unit place the unit in the Pleistocene (or ?Pliocene).|
24169|Baleine Formation|Name source|Baleine Bank; grid reference 515885, Pender 1:250 000 Sheet area.|
24169|Baleine Formation|Type section locality|2966-4175 ft (904-1273 m) in Lacepede 1A (17o5'8"S, 121o26'41"E).|
24169|Baleine Formation|Extent|The unit is present only in the subsurface of the offshore Canning Basin and southern Browse Basin.  Its limit to the east is uncertain, but its absence in either coastal wells or outcrop suggests it is west of the present shoreline.  No western limit is known due to lack of deep sea drilling.|
24169|Baleine Formation|Thickness range|Drilled thickness ranges from 94 m to 504 m. Isopach contours suggest it thickens to approximately 1000 m in the Rowley Shoals area.|
24169|Baleine Formation|Lithology|Chiefly claystone, grey, silty to arenaceous, common traces of glauconite as high as 10% and traces of mica and pyrite.  Towards the east the upper part is interbedded sandstone and siltstone.  The sandstone is grey; very fine to coarse grained, grain size decreases downhole to a very fine-grained argillaceous sandstone of siltstone; poor to well sorted with the degree of sorting increasing downhole; clay matrix; traces of glauconite carbonate cement up to 10% in the lower sandstone, and rock fragments.  Siltstone, grey, sandy and argillaceous.|
24169|Baleine Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Overlies an unnamed Middle-Upper Jurassic sandstone.  Detailed palynological dating has established the disconformity at the base.  The base is easily picked on well logs by the change in lithology from the underlying sandstone to claystone.  The upper contact is less well defined.  Overlain by unnamed Neocomian sandstone or claystone.  Palynological dating indicates the upper contact is disconformable in the east and conformable in the west.|
24169|Baleine Formation|Age reasons|Late Tithonian to early Neocomian.  The unit is diachronous from east to west.  Dating is based predominately on palynology from wells in the Canning Basin and fauna lists are contained in the offshore well completion reports for Keraudren 1, Bedout 1, Lacepede 1, Wamac 1, East Mermaid 1, Lynhner 1, and Leveque 1.|
24169|Baleine Formation|Comments|The unit has no onshore correlatives. Previously it has been included in or correlated with the Jarlemai and Jowlaenga Formations. Although the unit has lithological similarities to both formations, it is younger than either formation.|

33645|Bardsley Formation|Name source|Bardsley Well, RHODES (MGA 310200E, 7182850N; Fig. 1).|
33645|Bardsley Formation|Type section locality|The type area for the Bardsley Formation is the area north from the track that crosses Troy Creek (around MGA 319500E, 71893000N). No type section has been measured or is appropriate, due to the type of outcrop.|07/FEB/11
33645|Bardsley Formation|Extent|The Bardsley Formation has only been recognized in and adjacent to the headwaters of Troy Creek (Fig. 1), in the southern-central part of RHODES. Troy Creek cuts through a prominent range just south of the area of outcrop. This range may have served as a barrier that localized deposition.|07/FEB/11
33645|Bardsley Formation|Thickness range|The thickness of the Bardsley Formation is assumed to be only a few metres.|
33645|Bardsley Formation|Lithology|The formation consists of poorly sorted, variably ferruginized lithic sandstone and granule conglomerate infilling an irregular topography on the underlying Earaheedy Group, and is massive to poorly bedded. Commonly, only 20 to 50 cm of section can be seen because the unit is exposed as rubbly flats adjacent to the creek. There are common solution pits infilled by pisolitic ferricrete and clay-cemented gravel reworked from the Earaheedy Group.|
33645|Bardsley Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The Bardsley Formation clearly infills an irregular topography on the Earaheedy Group, and has not been folded or tilted like the Sydney Heads Pass Conglomerate, another unit of uncertain age on EARAHEEDY. The formation pre-dates the development of ferricrete, which probably occurred in the Oligocene or Eocene, but could have occurred in the Mesozoic (Hocking and Cockbain, 1990;  ockbain and Hocking, 1990). The lack of folding or tilting suggests that it post-dates the Collier  Group, which is moderately folded and faulted a few kilometres to the north and west. The distribution suggests southward-directed palaeocurrents, down Troy Creek.|
33645|Bardsley Formation|Age reasons|The formation pre-dates the development of ferricrete, which probably occurred in the Oligocene or Eocene, but could have occurred in the Mesozoic (Hocking and Cockbain, 1990;  Cockbain and Hocking, 1990). The lack of folding or tilting suggests that it post-dates the Collier  Group, which is moderately folded and faulted a few kilometres to the north and west. The Bardsley Formation thus has a possible age range of early Cainozoic to late Mesoproterozoic;  however, its probable age is post-Proterozoic, as palaeocurrent measurements from the Collier Group indicate northward flow, and those from the lower Sunbeam Group are westward. Deposition over the West Australian Craton (used broadly) was most extensive during the Early Permian Gondwana glaciation, but there are no polymictic boulder lags nearby to support a Permian age.|07/FEB/11
33645|Bardsley Formation|Comments|During mapping on RHODES, an isolated area of consolidated grit was recognized at the headwaters of Troy Creek, infilling the creek depression and adjacent areas. Exposures are discontinuous because of topography developed on deformed rocks of the Earaheedy Group beneath. The unit resembles the Wiluna Hardpan of Bettenay and Churchward (1974), but is somewhat older as it is penetrated by solution pits infilled with pisolitic ferricrete and reworked Earaheedy Group rocks.  For this reason it is named the Bardsley Formation.|07/FEB/11

3941|Cheela Springs Basalt|Unit history|The Cheela Springs Basalt is part of the Precambrian Wyloo Group (redefined, Trendall, 1979), south of the Hamersley Ranges.  The Cheela Springs Basalt (de la Hunty, 1965) is here raised from a member to a formation and excluded from the Mount McGrath Formation because it is overlain disconformably by clastics which are retained in the latter. (Map ref. Geological 1:250 000 Sheets Wyloo, Mount Bruce and Turee Creek). |
3941|Cheela Springs Basalt|Extent| [?] Map ref. Geological 1:250 000 Sheets Wyloo, Mount Bruce and Turee Creek.|
3941|Cheela Springs Basalt|Lithology|In the Cheela Springs area it is composed, at long. About 117degrees 58', of 900m of dominantly vesicular basalt with basal tuffaceous-looking shales which rest conformably on clastic rocks of the Beasley River Quartzite.|
3941|Cheela Springs Basalt|Correlations|The correlation by Daniels (1968) of the Cheela Springs Basalt with formations composed largely of basic lavas in the Turee Creek Syncline and the Mount McGuire district are accepted. In the Mount McGuire area however, the Formation is thicker and contains shale bands with red chert nodules at other levels than the base. These units might well have been eroded prior to deposition of the overlying clastics in the Cheela Springs district.|

26299|Coorong Creek Adamellite|Type section locality|The Coorong Creek Adamellite is well exposed near the lower reaches of Coorong Creek and along the Yule River above its junction with the creek.|
26299|Coorong Creek Adamellite|Extent|The Coorong Creek Adamellite occurs in the Yule Batholith (see Fig. 1) as an irregular elongate mass (which resembles the outline of Italy), extending northwest and southwest across the lower reaches of Coorong Creek, west of Woodstock homestead, between latitudes 21o32'S and 21o45'S and longitudes 118o48'E and 119o00'E.  The pluton has an area of about 110 km2.|
26299|Coorong Creek Adamellite|Lithology|The rock is a medium to coarse, even-grained biotite adamellite.  There are rare phenocrysts.  It is poorly to moderately foliated by alignment of feldspar, biotite, quartz and some biotite wisps and schlieren.  Medium, even-grained biotite granodiorite xenoliths and rare amphibolite xenoliths occur scattered throughout the pluton.  Pegmatites occur in most outcrops but are generally a minor feature.  The northwestern portion of the pluton has a more prominent foliation and contains more abundant xenoliths.  The adamellite contains microcline, oligoclase with myrmekite; biotite; accessory opaques, apatite, sphene, zircon and secondary chlorite, epidote, sericite and minor carbonate.|
26299|Coorong Creek Adamellite|Relationships and boundaries|Contacts with the adjacent migmatite complex are diffuse but clearly intrusive.  The abundance of migmatite remnants within the pluton suggests remobilization of the complex and emplacement at higher structural levels.  Its relationship with the Abydos Adamellite is uncertain.  Possibly the Coorong Creek Adamellite intrudes the Abydos Adamellite.  The Coorong Creek Adamellite is intruded by quartz veins occurring along faults and by Lower Proterozoic dolerite dykes including the Round Hammock suite and contaminated, xenolith-bearing Mundine Well suite.  Much of the pluton is obscured by thin Quaternary sand and gravel deposits.|

28476|Corboy Formation|Lithology|The unit consists mostly of quartzite, sandstone and psammopelitic sedimentary rocks.  There are minor felsic volcanics and ultramafic rocks in the southern portion of the formation and basalt, usually pillowed lavas, in the northern portion.|
28476|Corboy Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The relationships of the Corboy Formation to the surrounding units is obscured by regional slides.  However, it probably overlies conformably the Wyman Formation and conformably underlies the Paddy Market Formation.  It is stratigraphically equivalent to rocks of the Soanesville Subgroup in the Soanesville Belt.|

24244|Diemals Formation|Thickness range|Maximum thickness of 5 km (measured from airphotos)|
24244|Diemals Formation|Lithology|The lowermost unit of the formation is a silty argillite with interbedded, lensoid oligomictic conglomerate containing rounded clasts up to15 cm long of quartz-albite porphyry and jaspilite.  Overlying this argillite is a metamorphosed coarse-grained argillaceous quartz arenite with narrow intraformational pebble conglomerate layers.  Interbedded with the meta-arenite are lenticular beds of quartzite.  The formation has been metamorphosed to low amphibolite facies.|
24244|Diemals Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Unconformably overlies metavolcanics and graphitic phyllite of a greenstone belt and is intruded by biotite adamellite.  The base of the formation is poorly exposed while the top is unconformably overlain by Tertiary sediments.|
24244|Diemals Formation|Age reasons|The intruding biotite adamellite is about 2.6-2.7 b.y. (H Chapman pers. comm. 1979) and the underlying greenstones are considered to have developed about 2.7 b.y. (Gee 1979).  The age is therefore about 2.6-2.7 b.y.|

36000|Dingo Creek Granite|Unit history|Named as the Dingo Granite by Pearson (1996) and Pearson et al (1996). The unit was renamed as the Dingo Creek Granite by Martin et al. (2002).|
36000|Dingo Creek Granite|Geomorphic expression|Typically, low rounded hills covered in tors and boulders. Whalebacks present locally.|
36000|Dingo Creek Granite|Type section locality|About 5.5 km WSW of Red Hill Bore on the Edmund 100k map sheet centred at 714300E 7367500N (MGA94, Zone 50). The type locality can be accessed via a station track from Red Hill Bore and then by travelling off road. The main rock type here, as elsewhere in the unit, is a medium-grained biotite-muscovite syenogranite with a trachytic texture defined by thin tabular phenocrysts of K-feldspar.|
36000|Dingo Creek Granite|Extent|The unit comprises several elongate plutons aligned in an eastsoutheasterly direction, along with some small plugs and numerous dykes and veins. The unit outcrops in two belts less than 10 km wide and up to 30-40 km long within the Mangaroon Terrane in the northern Gascoyne Complex.|
36000|Dingo Creek Granite|Lithology|Mainly consists of medium- to fine-grained porphyritic biotite-muscovite syenogranite or syenogranite. K-feldspar phenocrysts comprise 40% or more of the rocks, and define a trachytic texture. Contacts between syenogranite and monzogranite phases with slightly different composition, grainsizes or phenocryst abundances are common within the plutons.|
36000|Dingo Creek Granite|Relationships and boundaries|The Dingo Creek Granite intruded rocks of the <c. 1680 ? 13 Ma Pooranoo Metamorphics, as well as the c. 1675 Ma Pimbyana Granite. The Dingo Creek Granite is extensively intruded by veins and dykes of muscovite-biotite-tourmaline granite and pegmatite also belonging to the Durlacher Supersuite. The Dingo Creek Granite is unconformably overlain by sedimentary rocks of the Edmund Group (Bangemall Supergroup) on the Mangaroon and Edmund 100K sheets.|
36000|Dingo Creek Granite|Age reasons|The Dingo Creek Granite has been dated by Pearson (1996) on the Mount Phillips 250k sheet at 1674 +/- 6 Ma, and by Nelson (GSWA 169062; Nelson, 2002) [, 2002 #870/ GSWA 169062] on Edmund at 1674 +/- 8 Ma. In addition, a sample from nearly 50km to the west-northwest on Mangaroon (GSWA 178028; Nelson, in prep.) gave an identical age of 1674 +/- 8 Ma.|

37648|Durlacher Supersuite|Constituents|Pimbyana Granite, Dingo Creek Granite, Yangibana Granite and several other un-named units|
37648|Durlacher Supersuite|Geomorphic expression|Typically, low rounded hills covered in tors and boulders. Whalebacks are common in some units.|
37648|Durlacher Supersuite|Extent|Forms plutons, plugs and dykes mainly in a southeasterly trending terrane about 50 km wide in the northern Gascoyne Complex. However, large plutons belonging to the supersuite are also present on the central part of the Maroonah 100K sheet farther north (Martin et al., 2004), and on the Mount Phillips and Daurie Creek 100K sheets farther to the south (Culver, 2001; Nelson, 2001, GSWA 169848). On the Marquis 100K sheet, large plutons of the c. 1620 Ma Discretion Granite intrude reworked granitic gneisses in the Yarlarweelor Gneiss Complex to the southeast of the Gascoyne Complex (Sheppard and Swager, 1999).|
37648|Durlacher Supersuite|Lithology|Mainly consists of monzogranite and granodiorite, with lesser syenogranite, and minor amounts of tonalite and rare gabbro. The granodiorite, monzogranite and syenogranite are medium to coarse grained and porphyritic (mainly tabular phenocrysts ? megacrysts of K-feldspar). They contain biotite only, biotite and muscovite, or muscovite, biotite and tourmaline. Mesocratic granodiorite and tonalite phases are mostly equigranular. Gabbro intrusions contain xenocrysts of K-feldspar and quartz and contain mingling textures with the granites.|
37648|Durlacher Supersuite|Relationships and boundaries|Granites (and gabbro) of the supersuite extensively intruded rocks of the <c. 1680 ? 13 Ma Pooranoo Metamorphics, in contrast to older granites of the Moorarie Supersuite. However, where granites of the two supersuites intrude older rocks, they cannot reliably be distinguished unless dated. Granites of the Durlacher Supersuite are unconformably overlain by sedimentary rocks of the Edmund Group (Bangemall Supergroup) on the Maroonah and Mangaroon 100K sheets.|
37648|Durlacher Supersuite|Age reasons|Several phases of the supersuite have been dated, including the Pimbyana, Yangibana and Dingo Creek Granites. Most granites that intruded the Pooranoo Metamorphics have igneous crystallization ages between 1685 and 1660 Ma (Sheppard and Occhipinti, in prep.). However, granites with crystallization ages between c. 1650 and c. 1620 Ma are known from elsewhere in the Gascoyne Complex (Sheppard and Swager, 1999; Culver, 2001; Nelson, 2001, GSWA 169848).|

26030|Millajiddee Member|Extent|Crops out in the St George Range, in the Poole Range, in the Lauris Range and other isolated exposures on the Noonkanbah Sheet area. At Mt Thorlan and in the southwestern St George Range the member is cut out by the unconformity at the base of the Poole Sandstone.  It occurs on the Mt Ramsay Sheet area to the east.|
26030|Millajiddee Member|Thickness range|70 m in the type section and estimated to be over 100 m in the southeastern St George Range.|
26030|Millajiddee Member|Lithology|Mainly sandstone and minor siltstone and conglomerate. Grain size mainly fine though a medium to coarse-grained middle part is present. Large and small-scale cross-bedding is common and the upper part is slumped in many areas.|
26030|Millajiddee Member|Relationships and boundaries|Conformably overlies the Wye Worry Member in the St George Range and Poole Range; disconformably in the Lauris Range. Conformably overlain by the Nura Nura Member of the Poole Sandstone though in some places, the contact is an unconformity|

It is thus a facies which, on the Turee Creek Sheet area, occurs north of the Capricorn Ranges and the Ashburton River and south of the foothills of the Hamersley Ranges.|
24380|Mininer Turbidite Member|Thickness range|At its thickest, the Member is at least 6000 m.|
24380|Mininer Turbidite Member|Lithology|It is largely composed of turbidites with a well developed cyclicity. Some very coarse members (pebbles up to 10 cm) and some shale intervals are present as well as rare foreign rafts which all three bridge the facies to the Capricorn Member. It contains rare, thin white flinty, tuffaceous bands (e.g. longitude 117o28.5'; latitude 23o21') which occur rarely in all members of the Ashburton Formation in the Sheet area.|
24380|Mininer Turbidite Member|Relationships and boundaries|The Mininer Turbidite Member is in a synclinorium and overlies, to the north, the Duck Creek Dolomite with which it interfingers in places. To the south, it overlies and interfingers extensively with the Capricorn Member (redefined).|

22396|Mount Aloysius Complex|Constituents|The following units have been mapped: fns - sillimanite-garnet granulite; crops out only in centre of massif.  fg - felsic garnet granulite; in central region of massif, and as thin bands in north and south.  fna - intermediate and felsic granites, weakly interlayered to massive; in east, and two bands in central region.  fn/m - thin to thick layered felsic granulite with numerous mafic granulite interlayers and rare calc-silicate and quartzite; the most distinctly layered unit, and forms the bulk of the massif.  fn - felsic granulite as a prominent disrupted layer in south, and another in the north.  mn - mafic granulite; mainly in northwest, but also as isolated layers in centre and east.  fnk - leucofelsic granulite as discrete bodies around margins of massif; weakly layered to massive.  No stratigraphic facing is preserved in the granulites, and so stratigraphic order is unknown.|
22396|Mount Aloysius Complex|Type section locality|The range of hills around and including Mount Aloysius (982 m ASL) is the type area. A reference section from GR 570210 (lat. 26.02922o, long. 128.57023o) to 590225 (lat. 26.01573o, long. 128.59027o) is representative of much of the complex, and exposes (from southwest to northeast) leucofelsic granulite (unit fnk), interlayered felsic and mafic granulites (fn/m) and felsic granulite (fn), felsic garnet granulite (fg), and sillimanite-garnet granulite (fns); a second reference section from GR 628237 (lat. 26.005o, long. 128.62828o) to 610230 (lat. 26.01127o, long. 128.61027o) exposes weakly layered to massive intermediate granulite (fna), and a third reference section from GR 557258 (lat. 25.98583o, long. 1285574o) to 559250 (lat. 25.99306o, long. 128.55937o) exposes mafic granulite (mn).|
22396|Mount Aloysius Complex|Extent|Revised (enlarged) Extent: Exposed over about 4000 km2 in the Tomkinson ranges of Western Australia and South Australia; extends from Mount Aloysius in the Bell Rock 1:100 000 Sheet (4645) in the west to Teizi Hill in the Davies 1:100 000 Sheet (4745) in the east, and south to Latitude Hill in the Bell Rock 1:100 000 Sheet; also extends into southwest of Bates 1:100 000 Sheet (4646).  Original Extent: Exposed over about 75 km2 in the northwest corner of Bell Rock (4645) and southeast corner of Bates (4646) 1:100 000 Sheet areas; forms a range of hills of which Mount Aloysius is the highest point (982 m ASL).|
22396|Mount Aloysius Complex|Lithology|Felsic, intermediate, and mafic granulites interlayered on scales ranging from centimetres to hundreds of metres.|
22396|Mount Aloysius Complex|Relationships and boundaries|No older rocks known. Intruded by small bodies of granite, syenite, granite pegmatite, and by innumerable mafic dykes.|
22396|Mount Aloysius Complex|Age reasons|A pooled age of 1578 +/- 20 Ma (Gray 1978, Gray & Compston 1978) by Rb-Sr whole-rock isochron method on felsic granulites is interpreted as protolith age because individual isochrons: (1) describe large bodies of rock or entire lithological units; (2) possess a large spread in Rb/Sr ratio; and (3) most are precise. In addition, initial ratios of felsic granulite layers are quite distinct from those of interlayered mafic granulite units. Confirmed by SHRIMP U-Pb zircon date of about 1530 Ma on banded felsic granulite (Sun & Sheraton 1992). Time of granulite metamorphism 1222 +/- 39 Ma (Gray 1978, Gray & Compston 1978) by Rb-Sr whole-rock isochron method, confirmed by SHRIMP U-Pb zircon date of about 1200 Ma (Sun & Sheraton 1992).|

12767|Mount Gratwick Granodiorite|Type section locality|The Granodiorite is exposed along the Yandeearra homestead - outcamp road, about 3-5 km northwest of the outcamp (at about MGR 119 302).|
12767|Mount Gratwick Granodiorite|Extent|The Mount Gratwick Granodiorite occurs in the Yule Batholith and forms an ovoid mass on the western margin of the Marble Bar 1:250 000 Sheet area, northwest of Mount Gratwick. The limits of the pluton on the adjacent Pyramid 1:250 000 Sheet area have not been determined. The mass crops out over an area of about 110 km2 between latitudes 21o35'S and 21o41'S, and longitudes 118o30'E and 118o35'E (see Fig. 1). The mass is poorly exposed and is obscured by superficial Quaternary sand and gravel deposits.|
12767|Mount Gratwick Granodiorite|Lithology|The Mount Gratwick Granodiorite is a medium, equigranular, allotriomorphic granular textured, poorly foliated granodiorite. In outcrop, the rock is cream-coloured and leucocratic and has an appearance resembling that of anorthosite. The rock contains some coarse pegmatite veins. Although poorly foliated, the rock contains some biotite schlieren and amphibolite xenoliths and there are local cataclastic zones with abundant epidote. The mineralogy consists of calcic oligoclase (An25) and minor quartz, accessory microcline, opaques and apatite, and secondary chlorite, epidote and muscovite. According to mineral proportions, the rock has a composition close to a leuco-diorite. (Type specimen GSWA 28488).|
12767|Mount Gratwick Granodiorite|Relationships and boundaries|The relationship of the Mount Gratwick Granodiorite to the surrounding Archaean migmatites is uncertain because of poor outcrop. However, regional foliations of the migmatite conform to the margins of the granodiorite and possibly the latter is an associated phase which has undergone more complete assimilation of biotite schlieren and amphibolite and ultramafic xenoliths which are abundant in the enclosing migmatite. The southern part of the Granodiorite is unconformably overlain by Lower Proterozoic Kylena Basalt.|

12923|Mount McGrath Formation|Name source|The Mount McGrath Formation is part of the Precambrian Wyloo Group (redefined, Trendall, 1979), south of the Hamersley Ranges (map ref. Geological 1:250 000 Sheets Wyloo, Mount Bruce and Turee Creek).|
12923|Mount McGrath Formation|Extent|The Formation (de la Hunty, 1965) is here restricted in usage to the essentially clastic rocks that overlie, disconformably the Cheela Springs Basalt and overlap unconformably onto older formations. It is overlain, conformably by the Duck Creek Dolomite which, itself, overlaps onto older units. In the southwest corner of the Mount Bruce Sheet area (de la Hunty, 1965) this redefined Formation was subdivided into the Coolbye Shale Member (which contains basal conglomerates at about long. 117o03') and the overlying Karlathundra Conglomerate. At the foot of Mt McGrath (Horwitz, 1978) the basal clastic units of the Formation contain massive carbonate bands and it abuts at low angle onto Hamersley Group rocks; 100 m are exposed and it is estimated that a top 200 m are covered by alluvium. The name Mount McGrath Formation is here applied to all the predominantly arenaceous rocks that extend from around the Wyloo Dome, south of the Duck Creek to the Angelo River and which are overlain conformably by the Duck Creek Dolomite. The Formation contains defined shale bands and, locally, massive carbonate lenses. Coarse, mature conglomerates are conspicuous and, south of Paraburdoo, where the formation rests on Hamersley Group BIF, Morris (1980) has observed in these conglomerates some pebbles derived from hematite ore.|

13856|Nardoopiquithanna Adamellite|Type section locality|Although the Adamellite is well exposed over most of its area, access is most readily attained via station and mining tracks from the Wittenoom-Port Hedland road (from a point near Kunagunarrina Pool) extending northwest towards Wodgina and west towards Round Hummock.|
13856|Nardoopiquithanna Adamellite|Extent|The Nardoopiquithanna Adamellite occurs northwest of Abydos in the Yule Batholith (see Fig. 1) as an arcuate mass, concave towards the south, between laltitudes 21o21'S and 21o19'S, and longitudes 118o40'E and 118o51'E. The pluton has an area of about 125 km2.|
13856|Nardoopiquithanna Adamellite|Lithology|The Nardoopiquithanna Adamellite is a massive to poorly foliated biotite adamellite. It is fine to medium-grained in the northern portion becoming medium-grained towards the south. The mass is strongly jointed and has almost total outcrop as low rocky ridges and large rounded tors. Pegmatites are sparse.|
13856|Nardoopiquithanna Adamellite|Relationships and boundaries|The pluton clearly cuts the strong foliation of older banded migmatite in the north and is intruded in the south by Numbana Granite which contains abundant xenoliths of the Adamellite. Relationships with porphyritic rocks to the east (Pincunah Adamellite) and west (Kangan Granite) are uncertain. Possibly the Nardoopiquithanna Adamellite intrudes both the Kangan Granite and Pincunah Adamellite since these exhibit a strong metamorphic foliation not observed in the Nardoopiquithanna Adamellite.|

24433|North Shaw Tonalite|Name source|North Shaw Well, Marble Bar 1:250 000 Sheet area (MGR 216 335).|
24433|North Shaw Tonalite|Type section locality|The pluton is well exposed near the North Shaw Well.|
24433|North Shaw Tonalite|Extent|The North Shaw Tonalite occurs as a small pluton (area of 35 km2) in the northern part of the Shaw Batholith (see Fig. 1), between latitudes 21o19'S and 21o23'S, and longitudes 119o23'E and 119o28'E.|
24433|North Shaw Tonalite|Lithology|The North Shaw Tonalite is an equigranular, poorly foliated biotite tonalite. The composition is variable due to assimilation of Archaean greenstone material from the enclosing country rock. The pluton is notable for the preservation of igneous textures. Near the North Shaw Well, the pluton is a fine-grained biotite tonalite with euhedral sericitized oligoclase, quartz, chlorite after biotite, opaque iron oxide; minor microcline, common accessory apatite and sphene, rare zircon and allanite; and secondary carbonate, epidote and sericite. Other varieties in the pluton occurring to the south and east of North Shaw Well are medium to coarse-grained biotite granodiorite, and medium-grained hornblende biotite granofiorite with hornblende phenocrysts. Accessory minerals are similar for these varieties except that sphene is more abundant in the latter type.|
24433|North Shaw Tonalite|Relationships and boundaries|The pluton intrudes mafic and felsic volcanic rocks of the Archaean Warrawoona Group. The pluton is intruded by Lower Proterozoic dolerite dykes and is unconformably overlain by Mount Roe Basalt. The relationship with gneissose and migmatitic granodiorite to the south is not known but the preservation of primary textures in the North Shaw Tonalite contrasted with the strong metamorphic foliation of the migmatitic rocks suggest that the Tonalite is younger and intrudes the migmatitic granodiorite.  The tonalite may be the source of numerous thin quartz-feldspar porphyry dykes which intrude the Archaean basalt around the North Shaw mining centre. Several quartz veins cut the pluton. Exposure is generally not good since it is obscured by extensive but thin Quaternary gravel and sand deposits.|

31962|Pimbyana Granite|Name source|Pimbyana Creek at MGA Zone 50, 434000E 7350000N|
31962|Pimbyana Granite|Unit history|The name "Pimbyana Granite" was first used by Pearson et al. (1996; AJES v.43, p.299-309). A brief description was provided, along with two whole-rock chemical analyses. The synonym "Pimbyana Granitoid" was introduced by Krapez (1999; AJES v 46(1), p.71-89) but no justification is given for the name change. The synonym is only mentioned in the paper, and the unit was not studied by the author.|
31962|Pimbyana Granite|Geomorphic expression|Low rounded hills covered in boulders and tors. Whalebacks with reddish weathered surfaces are common.|
31962|Pimbyana Granite|Type section locality|About 0.5 km NW of the Frasers-Yangibana REE prospect on the Edmund 100k sheet area (MGA Zone 50 429500E 7351500N). Access is via a station track from Gifford Creek Homestead via Fraser Bore.|
31962|Pimbyana Granite|Extent|The Pimbyana Granite forms a NW trending belt at least 90 km long comprising numerous intrusions extending from just north of Gifford Creek Homestead to near Maroonah Homestead. The most abundant rock type is a coarse-grained porphyritic to megacrystic biotite(-muscovite) monzogranite to syenogranite. The vast bulk of the intrusion contains squat tabular megacrysts or phenocrysts of microperthite, although between Bald Hill North and Henderson Bore on the Edmund 100K sheet, round K-feldspar megacrysts with graphic textures predominate. A fine- to medium-grained, even-textured tonalite or granodiorite that is comingled with the megacrystic phase is also included within the Pimbyana Granite.|
31962|Pimbyana Granite|Lithology|The most abundant rock type is a coarse-grained porphyritic to megacrystic biotite(-muscovite) monzogranite to syenogranite. Fine- to medium-grained biotite tonalite and granodiorite comprises an un-named member. It is only abundant in the area east and southeast of the Star of Mangaroon mine on the Mangaroon 100K sheet, and around the Frasers-Yangibana REE prospect on the Edmund 100K sheet. Between the Yangibana South and Frasers-Yangibana REE prospects, the Pimbyana Granite contains abundant inclusions metasedimentary and mafic meta-igneous rocks it is mapped as a separate, un-named member.|
31962|Pimbyana Granite|Relationships and boundaries|The Pimbyana Granite intrudes foliated porphyritic granodiorite and augen gneiss of the Gooche Gneiss, and metasedimentary rocks of the Pooranoo Metamorphics. The megacrystic monzogranite to syenogranite phase is intruded by various other units of the Durlacher Supersuite: namely the Dingo Creek Granite and the Yangibana Granite, and by extensive veins and dykes of muscovite-biotite granite, and tourmaline-bearing granite and pegmatite.|
31962|Pimbyana Granite|Age reasons|Two samples of porphyritic biotite-muscovite syenogranite have been dated at 1673 ? 15 Ma (GSWA 169060; D.R. Nelson, 2002, GSWA Record 2002/2) and 1673 ? 11 Ma (GSWA 178029; D.R. Nelson, in prep., GSWA Record 2004/2). A sample of fine-to medium-grained, even-textured biotite tonalite from about 500 m northwest of the Frasers-Yangibana prospect (GSWA sample 169054) has an indistinguishable SHRIMP U-Pb zircon age of 1674 ? 8 Ma (D.R.

37649|Pooranoo Metamorphics|Name source|Pooranoo Well (382300E 7363400N MGA 94) on the Mangaroon 100K sheet|
37649|Pooranoo Metamorphics|Geomorphic expression|Metamorphosed cobble and pebble conglomerate forms low ridges. Metamorphosed feldspathic sandstone and pelitic gneiss form low, undulating countryside dissected by numerous creeks.|
37649|Pooranoo Metamorphics|Type section locality|Between Maroonah Homestead, Red Rock Well and East Paddock Hill on the southern edge of the Maroonah 100K sheet. The area contains a well-defined contact between the two main units (pelitic gneiss and metamorphosed feldspathic sandstone). Also present are layers of metamorphosed cobble and granule conglomerate and quartz sandstone, and calc-silicate gneiss and schist. The pelitic gneiss is accessible from a station track and N-S fenceline east of Maroonah Homestead. Good exposures of metamorphosed feldspathic sandstone are located 2.75km SSW of Red Rock Well on the east side of a dolerite dyke. Metamorphosed cobble and pebble conglomerate and quartz sandstone are well exposed at East Paddock Hill.|
37649|Pooranoo Metamorphics|Extent|Confined to a southeasterly trending, fault-bounded terrane about 50 km wide in the northern Gascoyne Complex. The unit is in faulted contact with, or ?overlies, granites of the 1830-1780 Ma Moorarie Supersuite, which contrasts with older metamorphic units that are intruded by the supersuite.|
37649|Pooranoo Metamorphics|Lithology|Pooranoo Metamorphics comprises two main units in roughly equal proportions: metamorphosed feldspathic sandstone and pelitic gneiss. The metamorphosed feldspathic sandstone is interlayered with minor pelitic rock and granule conglomerate. Graded bedding is preserved in places in the metamorphosed feldspathic sandstone. Pelitic gneiss and granofels are mainly non-migmatitic, but in the area around the Star of Mangaroon Mine, migmatitic pelitic gneiss is abundant. The migmatites include both diatexites and metatexites. Interlayered metamorphosed cobble and pebble conglomerate, granule sandstone, calc-silicate gneiss and schist, and amphibolite and actinolite schist are minor rock types.|
37649|Pooranoo Metamorphics|Relationships and boundaries|Rocks of the Pooranoo Metamorphics are confined to a fault-bounded terrane. The metamorphics are separated from inliers of the c. 1770 Ma Gooche Gneiss by layer-parallel faults, and are intruded extensively by granites of the c. 1685-1620 Ma Durlacher Supersuite. The Pooranoo Metamorphics are unconformably overlain by sedimentary rocks of the Edmund Group (Bangemall Supergroup).|
37649|Pooranoo Metamorphics|Age reasons|The youngest population of detrital zircons from a sample of pelitic gneiss from southeast of Maroonah Homestead provide a maximum depositional age of 1680 ? 13 Ma (GSWA 169094; D.R. Nelson in press, GSWA Record 2003/2). Two samples of metamorphosed feldspathic sandstone provide maximum ages of 1800 ? 4 Ma (GSWA 169091; D.R. Nelson in press, GSWA Record 2003/2) and 1808 ? 11 Ma (GSWA 169056; D.R. Nelson 2002, GSWA Record 2002/2). However, these rock types are interbedded with pelitic gneiss and, therefore, the whole succession must have a maximum age of 1680 ? 13 Ma. The metamorphic rocks are intruded by granites of the 1685-1620 Ma Durlacher Supersuite, thus providing a minimum depositional age.|

74062|Strelley Pool Formation|Age reasons|Paleoarchean, 3427-3350 Ma, based on the youngest precise zircon U-Pb age obtained from the underlying Panorama Formation (3427 Ma; Nelson, 2001) and the oldest zircon U-Pb age from the Euro Basalt (3350 Ma: Geological Survey of Western Australia, 2005).|18/DEC/12
74062|Strelley Pool Formation|Comments|Name change from Strelley Pool Chert proposed because (a) the formation contains a wide range of lithologies, in which chert is commonly absent or minor, and (b) most of the chert in the formation is a seconadary replacement (partly Cenozoic) of primary carbonate rocks.Includes most of the succession previously informally named as the Strelley Pool Chert (Lowe, 1983), and formally named as the Strelley Pool Chert (Van Kranendonk and Morant, 1998).

As defined by (1) the group includes the Mosquito Creek Formation (Mallina Formation of (1)) and the Lalla Rookh Sandstone (Constantine Sandstone of (1)) but these formations are currently regarded as forming part of the Gorge Creek Group (as originally defined in (4)). As stated in (2) the Mons Cupri Volcanics overlies the Mallina Formation (Mosquito Creek Formation) 15 km southeast of Sherlock. Also, the Whim Creek Group is less deformed than the Gorge Creek Group, lying immediately adjacent to the south.|
26211|Whim Creek Group|Type section locality|Between Whim Creek centre and Mons Cupri (20o53'S, 117o48'E), but no single section affords a complete succession of the entire group.|
26211|Whim Creek Group|Type section locality|The lower part of the sequence is well exposed 2.5 km east of Mons Cupri while the upper part is well exposed in the immediate vicinity of Whim Creek Mine.|
26211|Whim Creek Group|Extent|Rocks of this unit are widely exposed between Whim Creek, Warambie Station, Kangan and to the west of Kangan some 80 km.|
26211|Whim Creek Group|Extent|Approx. 100 km2 between Mount Negri (20o53'S, 117o48'E), but no single section affords a complete succession of the entire group.|
26211|Whim Creek Group|Thickness range|Approx. 900 m|
26211|Whim Creek Group|Lithology|The unit is composed of four named formations: (1) The Warambie Basalt, (2) The ;Mons Cupri Volcanics, (3) The Constantine Sandstone, (4) The Mallina Formation.|
26211|Whim Creek Group|Relationships and boundaries|The unit is underlain unconformably by the Caines Well Granite or the Teichmans Group and overlain (probably disconformably by the Negri Volcanics).|
26211|Whim Creek Group|Relationships and boundaries|Unconformably overlies the Warrawoona Group (equivalent to Teichmans Group of (1)) 4 km west of Mount Fraser (20o56'S, 117o33'E). See (1) and (2). Conformably or disconformably overlies the Gorge Creek Group (4) 15 km south east of Sherlock homestead (20o53'S, 117o38'E). See (2). Unconformably overlain by the Negri Volcanics (1), and newly redefined to appear in (3)) at Mount Negri and southwest of Mons Cupri. Unconformably overlain by the Fortescue Group (Lower Proterozoic) 3 km west-northwest of Warambie. Low angle unconformity separates the group from rocks correlated with the overlying Louden Volcanics (newly defined and to appear in (3) approx. 10 km south-southeast of Sherlock homestead.|

35993|Yangibana Granite|Name source|Yangibana Creek (411500E 7356300N, Zone 50, MGA 94) on the Edmund 100K sheet area|
35993|Yangibana Granite|Unit history|Named and described by Pearson (1996) and mentioned by Pearson et al (1996). The definition expands on the distribution of the unit as described by Pearson (1996).|
35993|Yangibana Granite|Geomorphic expression|Typically, low rounded hills covered in tors and boulders.|
35993|Yangibana Granite|Type section locality|About 1.5km south of the Yangibana-Frasers REE prospect near the southern edge of the Edmund 100k sheet area, centred at 430100E 7349400N (Zone 50 MGA94). The locality can be accessed via station tracks from Gifford Creek Homestead to the prospect, then south off road. The locality is centred on a GSWA geochronology samples site (GSWA 169055). North of the site, toward the edge of the pluton, the granite contains numerous thin schlieren of biotite. About 500m north of the sample site, there is a contact with a phase of the Yangibana Granite that is rich in inclusions of metasedimentary rock.|
35993|Yangibana Granite|Extent|The Yangibana Granite forms two plutons on the southern half of the Edmund 100k sheet area, as well as dykes and veins in the surrounding metasedimentary rocks.|
35993|Yangibana Granite|Lithology|The Yangibana Granite is a massive, leucocratic, medium-grained biotite-muscovite syenogranite to monzogranite, which ranges from being equigranular to slightly porphyritic. Locally the granite contains clots of tourmaline. Large areas of the unit that are rich in inclusions of metasedimentary rock have been assigned to an un-named member of the unit.|
35993|Yangibana Granite|Relationships and boundaries|Dykes and veins of the Yangibana Granite extensively intrude metasedimentary rocks of the Pooranoo Metamorphics. Dykes and veins of the granite intrude the Pimbyana Granite. The Dingo Creek Granite is unconformably overlain by sedimentary rocks of the Edmund Group (Bangemall Supergroup) in the southeastern corner of the Edmund 100K sheet.|
35993|Yangibana Granite|Age reasons|The granite has been dated at two localities on the Edmund 100k sheet area: 4 km southeast of Fraser Well (GSWA sample 169055; Nelson, 2002) and 4 km southeast of Yangibana Bore (GSWA sample 169059; Nelson, 2002).  The two samples gave U-Pb SHRIMP ages of, respectively, 1659 +/-10 Ma and 1660 +/-9 Ma. These ages are comparable to other units of the Durlacher Supersuite.|19/MAY/10
35993|Yangibana Granite|Correlations|The Yangibana Granite is lithologically similar to, and probably coeval with, other leucocratic muscovite-biotite(-tourmaline) granites of the Durlacher Supersuite farther to the west and northwest on the Mangaroon and southern Maroonah 100k sheet areas.|
