27074|Aldinga Member|Unit history|Aldinga Limestone, Crespin, 1954, p.9-10, excluding those beds at and above the first appearance of chert nodules.  "Aldingan Unit" Lindsay, 1970, p.7.|
27074|Aldinga Member|Type section locality|Coastal cliffs along Aldinga Bay from Chinaman Gully, south across mouth of Aldinga Ck to near old jetty, specifically between 119-66 and 136-66 inclusive of Lindsay, 1967 (Figs 1 & 2).|
27074|Aldinga Member|Extent|From subsurface data, the unit occurs in the Willunga Embayment, west of McLaren Vale. It also occurs in other regions of the St Vincent Basin - in the Noarlunga Embayment and in the subsurface of the Adelaide Plains.|
27074|Aldinga Member|Thickness range|Range 0-20 m|
27074|Aldinga Member|Lithology|The unit consists of variable shelly and bryozoal clays, silts and sands, and limestones, which are fawn, yellow-brown and grey in colour. Quartz is the predominant detrital mineral although carbonate in the form of bioclastic material is also an important constituent.|
27074|Aldinga Member|Relationships and boundaries|The unit can be readily distinguished from the underlying Chinaman Gully Formation by its carbonate content. The top of the Aldinga Member is clearly defined in outcrop sections by the first appearance of chert nodules characteristic of the Ruwarung Member.|
27074|Aldinga Member|Age reasons|Latest Eocene in age after Lindsay (1969). Lindsay studied the foraminifera and recognised two zones within the type section, the top Eocene (Subbotina linaperta Zone) and the top part of the underlying Turborotalia aculeata Zone).|
27074|Aldinga Member|Comments|The Aldinga Member as considered here is clearly a modification of the original usage of Crespin (1954). The boundaries are here rigidly defined whereas Crespin's original proposal was vague and she was probably referring to the entire Port Willunga Formation as outcropping at the type section.|
24153|Alinerta Gravel|Name source|Mount Alinerta; grid reference 576115, Dalhousie 1:250 000 Sheet area.|
24153|Alinerta Gravel|Unit history|Part of "Gypsite land surface" on Oodnadatta 1:250 000 geological map area (Freytag et al., 1967); Warrina surface (Wopfner, 1978, p.122).|
24153|Alinerta Gravel|Type section locality|Four metres gypcreted gravel at grid reference point 573104 (Air photo point Alinerta/2/080/5) exposed in a bluff. Reference section at 543057 (Air photo point Hamilton/1/0126/17) in dissected land surface.|
24153|Alinerta Gravel|Extent|The unit occurs in the breached anticlines on Dalhousie 1:250 000 Sheet area (SG53-11), covering an area of some 400 km2.|
24153|Alinerta Gravel|Thickness range|Usually 2-5 m.|
24153|Alinerta Gravel|Lithology|Gypcreted, conglomeratic, silty sand; clasts of silcrete pebbles, cobbles and boulders, and of bleached and porcellanitized Mesozoic shale; gypsum finely to coarsely crystalline and imparts a very pale buff to pink hue to the unit.|
24153|Alinerta Gravel|Relationships and boundaries|Overlies Marree Subgroup with erosional disconformity and mild angular unconformity. Lower boundary usually obscured but in places can be observed channelling into Marree Subgroup. Upper boundary almost invariably ground surface.|
24153|Alinerta Gravel|Age reasons|No fossils have been recovered. Age indirectly estimated as Early Pleistocene from the tectonic development of Dalhousie Anticline.|
24153|Alinerta Gravel|Comments|Alinerta Gravel is interpreted as the gypcreted debris derived from the break-up of anticlinal crests. Levelling out of debris during reworking, and fixing by groundwater gypsum impregnation, formed extensive, low-relief Pleistocene land surfaces which were dissected following tectonic uplift. Photo-interpretation indicates multiple surfaces representing intermittent tectonic uplift.|
540|Arburee Rhyolite|Name source|From Arburee paddock on Lake Everard Station. Arburee paddock is adjacent to extensive outcrops of Arburee Rhyolite. The centre of this paddock is located at 31o48.5' lat. And 134o43' longitude.|
540|Arburee Rhyolite|Type section locality|Defined as a north-south section through the range of hills immediately to the north of Lake Everard homestead. The section goes from the basal contact to the brecciated upper contact. Lake Everard homestead is at lat. 31o44.5' and long. 135o10.5'.|
540|Arburee Rhyolite|Extent|Forms a long narrow dyke-like outcrop crossing from the south-western portion of the Gairdner 1:250 000 Sheet area onto the south-eastern portion of the Childara 1:250 000 Sheet area, occupying outcrop area of roughly 110 km2.|
540|Arburee Rhyolite|Lithology|In weathered outcrop the unit has a distinct orange colour, but in fresh hand specimen the colour is a purplish-grey. In hand specimen the rock consists of coarse grained phenocrysts of alkali feldspar and medium-grained rounded phenocrysts of quartz sitting in an aphanitic groundmass - i.e., a rhyolite porphyry.  Well developed, contorted flow-banding is often developed on macro and micro scale. In thin section the rock consists of euhedral, corroded and altered phenocrysts of alkali feldspar of medium to coarse grainsize and anhedral medium grainsize phenocrysts of quartz. Plagioclase phenocrysts are very rare and ferromagnesian minerals and their alteration products are totally absent. Alkali feldspar phenocrysts:quartz phenocrysts roughly 4:1 with the phenocrysts making up 33% of the rock. Groundmass exhibits a snowflake devitrification texture and consists of a finely crystalline mosaic of quartz and feldspar. Red limenite is scattered throughout the groundmass. The complete devitrification has completely obliterated any original textures.|
540|Arburee Rhyolite|Relationships and boundaries|In the west on the Childara 1:250 000 Sheet area the Arburee Rhyolite is clearly intrusive into the Mangaroongah Dacite. In the east in the vicinity of Lake Everard homestead, the Arburee Rhyolite conformably overlies the Mangaroongah Dacite. The upper contact of the Arburee Rhyolite is marked by a zone of autobrecciation (mainly flow brecciation) with angular blocks up to several metres across. These features indicate that the Arburee Rhyolite is a lava dome - i.e., a thick localised pile of highly viscous lava, with its feeder conduit (or roots) exposed in the west - as evidenced by its intrusive nature here. This unit has been previously correlated with the Wheepool Rhyolite (Blissett) by Blissett. Detailed mapping has led the proposer to believe this correlation is in error and that the Arburee Rhyolite is a distinct unit, as defined. Thickness not estimable.|
540|Arburee Rhyolite|Age reasons|Co-magmatic with the rest of the volcanics in the Glyde Hill Complex (Blissett) as is conformably overlain by the Bunburn Dacite. Therefore age is roughly 1550 my - or mid-Carpentarian from geochronology.|

24164|Arcoeillinna Sandstone|Relationships and boundaries|Sharply overlies (erosionally) the Observatory Hill on the northern margin of the Mount Johns Range. On the eastern margin of the range, there is an intertonguing and transitional lower boundary with the Observatory Hill Beds. Shale overlain by the Mount Johns Conglomerate.|
24164|Arcoeillinna Sandstone|Age reasons|No fossil or radiometric age. Overlies the Early-?Middle Cambrian Observatory Hill Beds and underlies the ?Ordovician Mount Chandler Sandstone.|
24165|Arkaba Hill Beds|Name source|Arkaba Hill; grid reference 648725ON, 263250E Parachilna 1:250 000 sheet area.|
24165|Arkaba Hill Beds|Type section locality|242 m thick; strata overturned.  A line SE-NW from the ridge top, to the valley floor adjacent to the contact of the intrusion, 350 m southwest of Pointy Hill.|
24165|Arkaba Hill Beds|Extent|The type area is a 2170 x 850 m xenoclast in the Arkaba Breccia Intrusion, that is exposed in an arc from 1 km west, through to 1 km north of Arkaba Homestead. The Beds are also recognised in numerous xenoclasts throughout the Arkaba and other breccia intrusions of the Flinders Ranges.|
24165|Arkaba Hill Beds|Thickness range|242 m; i.e. Beds limited by margin of xenoclast.|
24165|Arkaba Hill Beds|Lithology|60 m of red-brown weathered, greenish-grey, finely laminated, part ferruginous and calcareous, siliceous argillite at the base are overlain by interlaminated to interbedded thin silty ferroan dolostones with light greenish grey or blue grey siltstones of shales, some with casts of halite crystal impressions. Some beds grade to massive metadolostone; very fine, light grey, with scattered laminae of dark-weathered arkosic sand. Top unit is a suite of interbedded laminated pale blue-green, light blue, light green, and pale grey, part dolomitic, siliceous metasiltstones with ferroan metadolostones. Grade to thin bedded, some massive or flaggy, light grey dolostones with fine arkosic sand laminae, chert nodules, heavy-mineral lamination, fine current cross-lamination and laminar stromatolites.|
24165|Arkaba Hill Beds|Relationships and boundaries|As the type area is a xenoclast in an intrusion, stratigraphic relationships can never be traced directly to other areas. Boundary of the Type Area is the margin of the xenoclast which is tectonic in origin.|
24165|Arkaba Hill Beds|Age reasons|Older than the lowest host strata to the Arkaba Intrusion: i.e. pre-Sturtian. Younger than pre-Adelaidean crystalline basement. Probably Willouran (see Mount, 1975).|
947|Baldry Rhyolite|Name source|From Baldry dam and paddock on Lake Everard station. Baldry paddock contains most of the exposed outcrop of Baldry Rhyolite. Baldry dam is located at 31o41 1/4' lat. And 135o04 1/2' longitude.  Origin: The Baldry Rhyolite is extremely variable, with no two outcrops exhibiting the same textural features. As the Baldry Rhyolite forms only low subdued outcrops few good sections are observable. However, on the basis of the variability and type of rocks forming the Baldry Rhyolite and the rapid thinning of this unit at its margins it is considered that the Baldry Rhyolite is a lava dome made up of highly viscous rhyolitic lavas and explosive ashflows (of low energy) that have been extruded onto a slope, hence explaining the flowage during welding. The source is not obvious, but undoubtedly would have been located within the confines of the present outcrop of the Baldry Rhyolite.|
947|Baldry Rhyolite|Type section locality|Due to the variable nature of this unit it is not possible to propose a type section.|
947|Baldry Rhyolite|Extent|Confined almost entirely to the far south west of the Gairdner 1:250 000 Sheet area. A few outcrops extend over onto the Childara 1:250 000 Sheet area. The outcrop covers a roughly circular area of diameter 12 km.|
947|Baldry Rhyolite|Lithology|A white to buff coloured rock, invariably containing quartz phenocrysts, but showing a wide variety of textures. At one extreme flow banding is pervasively developed on all scales, often being extremely contorted, indicating an origin as a highly viscous lava. On the other extreme the unit appears to be a poorly welded lapilli-tuff of ashflow origin. The lapilli size lithic fragments and crystals of quartz and alkali feldspar are set in a vitroclastic groundmass, consisting of slightly deformed glass shards and pumice fragments, now entirely devitrified, but with outlines clearly visible. The most common rock type making up the Baldry Rhyolite lies between these two extremes and is a strongly welded lithic-vitric-crystal tuff of ashflow origin, exhibiting a well developed eutaxitic texture formed by the flattened lithic and pumice fragments. The glass shards in the groundmass are markedly flattened and wrapped around the crystals and lithic fragments. Often a semi-continuous flow banding is developed, indicating a certain degree of flowage during welding - thus the term rheoignimbrite would be applicable to these rocks. Rheoignimbrites are the major rock type making up the Baldry Rhyolite.|
947|Baldry Rhyolite|Relationships and boundaries|The Baldry Rhyolite is considered to be younger than the Bunburn Dacite although the contact between the two is never seen. The Baldry Rhyolite is unconformably overlain by the Yantea Rhyodacite. The Baldry Rhyolite is very localised and is probably at least 60 m thick in the central regions of its outcrop, however at its margins it thins rapidly. The Baldry Rhyolite is almost certainly a lava dome formed of a series of highly viscous lava flows and ash flows, hence explaining its localised nature.|
947|Baldry Rhyolite|Age reasons|Belongs to the Glyde Hill Complex as defined by Blissett. The complex is of mid-Carpentarian age, roughly 1550 ma upon the basis of geochronology.|

24194|Bosanquet Formation|Name source|Mount Bosanquet, a prominent hill 10 km east of the type section, on the Kimba 1:100 000 sheet (No. 6131) of the Kimba 1:250 000 sheet.|
24194|Bosanquet Formation|Type section locality|(Fig. 3) Broad View DDH 1 (Latitude 33o24'53"S, Longitude 136o19'8"E) over the interval 26.2 to 407.8 m. The drillhole did not intersect the eastern limit (possibly the top) of the formation.|
24194|Bosanquet Formation|Extent|A 1 km-wide zone of outcrop and subcrop, with a strike length of 6 km, approximately 5 km east of Carappee Hill (Flint and Rankin, in prep.). Cainozoic sediments totally veneer basement lithologies to the west, but the Bosanquet Formation may be repeated by tight F2 folding of the Kimban Orogeny.|
24194|Bosanquet Formation|Thickness range|In the incomplete type section it is 381.6 m but is inferred to have a minimum thickness of approximately 1000 m.|
24194|Bosanquet Formation|Lithology|The Bosanquet Formation consists of megacrystic, recrystallised and deformed rhyodacite containing relic phenocrysts of coarse-grained microcline and medium-grained, subequant, bluish quartz, with a recrystallised matrix of fine-grained quartz + feldspar + biotite (+/- muscovite, sphene and zircon). The rhyodacite varies from weakly-foliated (with abundant megacrysts and minor embayed quartz) to proto- or blastomylonitic (with attenuation and dynamic recrystallisation of megacrysts producing an intense foliation). The degree of deformation decreases down the drillhole.  Banded grey-green, medium to coarse grained, granoblastic to granoblastic-elongate calcsilicate gneisses are interlayered with the rhyodacites in bands varying from 20 cm to 20 m thick. Rhyodacite clasts also occur within the calcsilicate gneisses, which contain diopside + quartz + microcline + plagioclase + actinolite hornblende + biotite + calcite, and have a weak to intense foliation. Diopside within the gneisses has been partially replaced by hornblende. Coarse grained, diopside-rich calcsilicate gneisses are exposed 500 m north of the drillhole. They contain elongate clasts of rhyolite-rhyodacite, dolomitic marble, granite and quartzite.|
24194|Bosanquet Formation|Depositional environment|The association of porphyritic acid volcanics and carbonate-matrix conglomerateas (containing volcanic fragments) suggests volcanism contemporaneous with either marine or lacustrine sedimentation.|
24194|Bosanquet Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The surface contact of the Bosanquet Formation with the Hutchison Group metasediments is concealed by a veneer of Cainozoic sediments, and is only known from drillcore. Within Broad View DDH 1, the boundary between the two units occurs at a depth of 407.8 m, and is marked by a zone of broken core and significant water loss during drilling. The boundary is lithologically sharp between iron-rich and calcium-rich lithologies of the Upper Middleback Jaspilite and acid volcanics of the Bosanquet Formation. There is a slight angular discordancy of 8o for the pervasive metamorphic foliations either side of the contact. It is unclear whether the contact represents either a contemporaneous change from sedimentation to volcanics, or an unconformity with an hiatus in sedimentation prior to eruption of the rhyodacites, or a fault. Stratigraphic facing for the formation is not known, but is assumed to be easterly, consistent with the dip of the foliation.|
24194|Bosanquet Formation|Age reasons|Rb-Sr geochronology had previously been undertaken on specimen 6131RS45 from exposed volcanics west of the drillhole. The volcanics are highly deformed with ovoid phenocrysts and well-developed biotite and muscovite foliations. The Rb-Sr biotite total rock age was 1626 Ma with an initial 87Sr/86/Sr ratio of 0.7127. Due to low enrichment of radiogenic Sr in the total rock analysis, the age is strongly influenced by the biotite analysis and was thus interpreted to reflect a deformational episode rather than the age of primary crystallisation (Webb and Fanning, 1984).  U-Pb zircon geochronology was carried out on a sample of deformed rhyodacite (6131RS136) collected between 402.6-407.5 m in Broad View DDH 1. Procedures for dissolution, extraction and U-Pb isotopic analysis of the zircons were essentially identical to those reported in Fanning et al. (in press).  Zircon characteristics: The ziracons are characteristically clear, euhedral crystals which have a very pale gold colour. Crystals commonly have one pyramidal termination or are fractured fragments of euhedral crystals. Growth zoning is seen in some grains. Many contain opaque inclusions and colourless, oval and acicular inclusions or voids. There are significant numbers of clear, doubly-terminated cyrstals (Fig. 4).  U-Pb zircon results: The isotopic data are given in Table 1 and plotted on Fig. 5. The five conventional analyses are all discordant and the zircons have apparently lost between 17 and 63 percent of their radiogenic lead if one assumes a simple lead loss model. There is excess scatter about a discordia line fitted to these conventional analyses, MSWD = 13, with an upper concordia intercept of 1848+/-10 Ma and lower intercept of 16+/-30 Ma. These analyses show a strong positive correlation between degree of discordance and U content which suggests a cogenetic suite of zircons. Two crystals from the -160+92 nmO fraction were analysed by the small-sample technique. These grains were pale gold in colour, but glassy clear. They were very elongate grains each having one fractured and one pyramidal termination. The small-sample anslysis is marginally more concordant than the conventional analysis from the -72+53 nmO fraction (16 percent lead loss compared to 17 percent). A discordia line fitted to all siz analyses has a slightly higher MSWD of 15 but the intercepts of 1845+/-9 and 10+/-30 Ma are statistically indistinguishable from the conventional discordia. The apparent simple euhedral morphology of the zircons suggests that they are nof igneous origin and unaffected by metamorphism/deformation. The upper concordia intercept of 1845+/-9 Ma is therefore considered to record the crystallisation age of these zircons and the rhyodacite.|
24194|Bosanquet Formation|Correlations|Both the boundary relationships with the Upper Middleback Jaspilite and petrographic evidence of intense folding and mylonitisation of the rhyodacites suggest that the Bosanquet Formation was deposited prior to the later stages of the Kimban Orogeny (Rankin and Flint, 1987). The U-Pb zircon age of 1845+/-9 Ma indicates that the Bosanquet Formation is appreciably older than other known Early Proterozoic silicic volcanics of the Gawler Craton, namely the Myola Volcanics (1791+/-4 Ma) and the McGregor Volcanics (1740 Ma) (Fanning et al., in press). This is consistent with geochemical dissimilarities between these three volcanic units (Rankin and Flint, 1987). The age is very similar to the 1850 Ma emplacement age of the Donington Granitoid Suite of southern Eyre Peninsula (Mortimer et al., 1986), which is interpreted to be coincident with the earliest deformational phase of the Kimban Orogeny. The Bosanquet Formation has no other known regional correlatives within South Australia. Volcanics of similar age occur in northern Australia (Wyborn et al., in prep,) including the Leichhardt Volcanics of the Mount Isa area (Blake, 1987) and the El Sherana and Edith River Group of the Pine Creek Inlier (Needham and Stuart-Smith, 1985). Calcsilicate bands in the Bosanquet Formation are lithologically identical to calcsilicates interbanded with Hutchison Group iron formation below 408 m in Broad View DDH 1. This suggests that the Bosanquet Formation may be a previously-unrecognised volcanic unit of the Hutchison Group although deposition of the Hutchison Group has been considered to precede the 1850 Ma Donington Granitoid Suite. The Bosanquet Formation is therefore interpreted to have been deposited within a restricted area of the central Gawler Craton either synchronous or immediately following regional deposition of the Hutchison Group.|

3975|Childera Dacite|Thickness range|At least 200 m.|
3975|Childera Dacite|Lithology|In hand specimen is a dark green to dark grey aphanitic rock with rare scattered phenocrysts of plagioclase feldspar. The rare, medium grained phenocrysts are well oriented. In thin section is quite variable, but the altered, corroded, euhedral plagioclase feldspar phenocrysts sitting in an aphanitic groundmass is characteristic. Clinopyroxene (augite) occurring as numerous very fine grained euhedral phenocrysts is common, with occasional phenocrysts reaching 2 mm in diameter. White quartz phenocrysts are absent. Groundmass is variable, but most commonly it consists of an aphanitic devitrified mosaic with variable amounts of magnetite and chlorite, imparting a dark grey to dark green colour to the rock respectively. When the magnetite is oxidised to limonite a brownish tinge is imparted to the rock. Sometimes the groundmass consists of strongly oriented plagioclase laths of very fine grainsize interlocking with chlorite, magnetite and K feldspar. The proportion of plagioclase and clinopyroxene phenocrysts is roughly equal, the total phenocryst component making up from 2-10% of the rock.|

24225|Coolardie Formation|Name source|From Coolardie Park Homestead, about 8 km southeast of Lock, Tooligie 1:100 000 sheet, Eyre Peninsula, South Australia.|
24225|Coolardie Formation|Type section locality|Typical Coolardie Formation occurs from 188 m to 369 m in SADME stratigraphic borehole Lock No. 1 (State No. 557000901) located on Kimba 1:250 000 sheet, Tooligie 1:100 000 sheet 57795E 6280085N, County Musgrave, Hundred Palkagee, adjacent Section 9. Eyre Peninsula, South Australia.|
24225|Coolardie Formation|Thickness range|The thickest recorded sections of the Coolardie Formation are in Lock No. 1 and Polda No. 8 where thicknesses of 181 m and 108 m have been recognised respectively. Seismic refraction results from the Lock No. 1 site imply Precambrian basement at a depth of 650 m and a thickness of Late Palaeozoic sediments in the range of 480 m.|
24225|Coolardie Formation|Lithology|The Coolardie Formation is composed principally of glacial and glacially-derived sediments. A thick succession of brown, grey, green and white coloured mudstones, siltstones and sandstones is most characteristic of the unit. Most horizons also contain assorted cobbles, pebble sand and smaller fragments of igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary origins.|
24225|Coolardie Formation|Relationships and boundaries|It is presumed that the Coolardie Formation unconformably overlies either the ?mid-Proterozoic coarse-grained feldspathic sands, grits and conglomerates of the Blue Range Beds that are found at nearby Mt Wedge and Talia Caves (Flint and Parker 1981) or ?Precambrian granite similar to that described from the Bramfield area (Harris and Foster 1974). However the base of the formation has not yet been penetrated by SADME drilling. The Coolardie Formation is unconformably overlain by the Late Jurassic Polda Formation, a unit of sand, silt and lignite.|
24225|Coolardie Formation|Age reasons|The Coolardie Formation contains microfloras, which may be compared with the Stage 2 assemblage of Evans (1969) and Kemp et al. (1977). Unpublished work by Norvik quoted in Kemp et al. (1977, p.189) suggests that this assemblage is correlated with his Upper Stage 2 due to the occurrence of the trilete spores Microbaculispora tentula, Apiculatisporis cornutus (Balme and Hennelly) Hoeg and Bose and Punctatisporites gretensis. The absence of Verrucosisporites pseudoreticulatus Balme and Hennelly mitigates against correlation with Stage 3. This microfloral assemb lage enables the Coolardie Formation to be correlated with the lower Tamarian stage in the Permo-Carboniferous (Rekunian) succession of Tasmania (Clark and Farmer 1976; Truswell, 1978). On current knowledge this interval is best correlated with latest Carboniferous on the international scale (Balme, 1980). Locally the Coolardie Formation is correlated with the Cape Jervis Beds in the Troubridge Basin and the Boorthanna and basal Stuart Range Formations in the Arckaringa Basin (Cooper, 1981).|

26491|Coomb Spring Formation|Age reasons|From relationships to Namba Fm. and Eurinilla Formation, age could range over all or any part of Late Miocene to Middle Pleistocene. The Millyera Formation has normal magnetic polarity, and is thought to be Bruhne. Dates on shell in the Coomb Spring Fm are given in Callen et al and shown above. They suggest an age beyond the limit of radiocarbon dating. Estimates by Callen et al suggest the age of the unit is likely to be at least 95 000 years old|

24255|Dullingari Group|Lithology|The type section is dominantly a shale section, with minor siltstone; pyrite is a major accessory mineral with dolomite and calcite. At Daralingie-1 sandstone containing glauconite? and lithic grains was intersected and at Daralingie-2 shale with interbedded sandstone occurs. All lithologies are characterised by a high degree of induration, most probably to the zeolite facies of metamorphism.

27149|Eregunda Sandstone Member|Lithology|Fine-grained red micaceous arkose, with minor shale and siltstone interbeds. Poorly bedded to horizontally laminated, with minor tabular and rare trough cross-stratification.|
27149|Eregunda Sandstone Member|Relationships and boundaries|Upper member of the Billy Creek Formation in the central Flinders Ranges and at Mount Scott. Red micaceous sandstones of the Eregunda Sandstone Member rest sharply but conformably on shales and siltstones of the Nildottie Siltstone Member. The unit is overlain conformably by the Wirrealpa Limestone in the central Flinders Ranges, and by the Wirrealpa Limestone at Mount Scortt (Youngs, 1977).|
27149|Eregunda Sandstone Member|Age reasons|The Lower-Middle Cambrian boundary occurs at an undefined position in the upper portion of the Billy Creek Formation (Daily, 1956). It is likely therefore that the Eregunda Sandstone Member is largely, if not entirely, early Middle Cambrian in age.|

24637|Fulham Sand|Unit history|Fulham Sand has been informally referred to as the "Older Sand Dunes" by Fenner (1927) and Miles (1952), and the "Osborne Association" by Aitchison et al. (1954).|
24637|Fulham Sand|Type section locality|None readily accessible; none described by Firman (1966). Reference section: 2.95 metres of fine, very well sorted quartz sand, colour 5YR 4/8 (yellowish red); intersected in cored hole GH36 (SADME Core Library number 662800301060) by Metro-Adelaide Soil Investigations. Site: small reserve off Telford St, Findon, Section 428, Hundred of Yatala, (grid ref. 73883460, Sheet 6628-41, 1:10 000 Series, SA Lands Department).|
24637|Fulham Sand|Extent|The unit is exposed as irregular dunes on the southern Adelaide Plains between Somerton Park (south) and Port Adelaide (north), and from 1 to 4 km inland from the present coast line. The areal extent is about 60 square kilometres.|
24637|Fulham Sand|Thickness range|Range 0-15 metres.|
24637|Fulham Sand|Lithology|Sand, quartzose, fine well-sorted, mean size range 250-177 micron (2.00-2.50 phi units, standard deviation 0.50 and 0.7 phi). Grain size distribution is slightly negatively to slightly positively skewed, kurtosis (k = 0.6 to 2.0) ranging from mesokurtic to leptokurtic. Sand upper portions generally affected by pedogenic process. Mineralogy: 98% quartz, minor lithics (feldspars, ferro-magnesians, garnet, silimanite) after Cornelius & Stevens (1945) and Aitchison et al. (1954). Sand grains moderately well rounded, frosted and irregularly coated with clay and iron oxides.|
24637|Fulham Sand|Depositional environment|Aeolian, based on granulometric character, unit-morphology, distribution, topography, stratigraphy. Sub-coastal location and morphology suggest dunes are a reworked pre Holocene coastal sand barrier. Sand source probably Adelaide Plains ephemeral streams.|
24637|Fulham Sand|Relationships and boundaries|Overlies Glanville Fm (Firman, 1966, Cann, 1978) and Pooraka Fm (Daily et al., 1976) and various "Quaternary alluvium" deposits. It is unconfined except where overlain by various anthropogenic deposits.|
24637|Fulham Sand|Age reasons|Late Pleistocene. Fulham sand is unfossiliferous, it overlies the Glanville Fm (last Interglacial in Age, 110 KA, Belperio et al., 1984), it also overlies Pooraka Fm (35 KA, Williams, 1969; 20-30 KA Belperio & Bateman, 1986). It is stratigraphically overlain by St Kilda Fm., Holocene (7 KA, Bowman & Harvey, 1986). Probable Age 16-20 KA, Fulham Sand dunes were likely initiated during aeolian landscape instability during last Glacial - recognised by Belperio et al. (1983, 84).|

25918|Garford Formation|Extent|The Garford Formation essentially occupies the Tallaringa Palaeodrainage System and portions of a topographic depression southwest of Coober Pedy, centred on Lake Phillipson (Fig. 4). Specifically, the green and white clays have been recorded in the Tallaringa Palaeochannel between WL 5 and Tallaringa Well (represented by outcrops of high-grade sepiolite clay in 'R.S. Lake'). Both north and south of this zone, the unit has been removed by post-Miocene erosion; south of WL 5, the Pidinga Formation subcrops beneath dune sands. In the Garford Palaeochannel, clays infilling the channel, overlie Pidinga Formation, from TPS14 to TPS3 (Fig. 4). Continuity is interrupted by 'bars' of weathered and/or fresh crystalline basement, exposed by post-Garford erosion. Limestone (and interbedded clays) in the upper part of the preserved Garford Formation are exposed on the southern margin of the channel near TPS5 and 4 southwest of Wallira 2, and near Wallira 1, Lake Phillipson and Mickey's Swamp.|
25918|Garford Formation|Lithology|The dominant lithologies of exposures, seen in many of the claypans of the Garford Palaeochannel, consist of white, generally calcareous clays (dolomitic in part), with lesser green pearly-lustred palygorskitic, or rarely sepiolitic clays. The white clays are dense, and when dry, break with a splintery fracture. The green clays, usually non-calcareous, often contain 1-2 mm sized, well-rounded to angular grains of blue to milky quartz, and rare 1-5 mm sized, well-rounded clasts of cream-coloured silcrete. Both types of clay may be sandy, particulalry at the top and bottom of the unit, and thin sand lenses may be present. A thin, but relatively widespread dolomitic limestone (Fig. 4) forms the top of the formation.|
25918|Garford Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The Garford Formation is underlain by sands and lignites of the Eocene Pidinga Formation. Intersections in TPS4 and TPS6, shown in figure 2, suggest this contact is unconformable. Despite this, the contact is generally not sharp, probably owing to the lack of lithifaction and consequent ease of reworking of the underlying unit. In the Lake Phillipson area, the Garford Formation overlies still older units. Its upper contact is likewise erosional and gradational with the overlying Wintrena Beds of late Tertiary to Quaternary age. An intertonguing relationship between Garford Formation and interpreted Mount Sarah Sandstone has been described above. On the basis of the distinctive lithology and dolomite-palygorskite-sepiolite clay mineralogy that the Garford Formation has in common with the Etadunna and Namba Formations of the Lake Eyre and Tarkarooloo Basins (Callen and Tedford, 1976), it is considered to be a  time and rock-correlative thereof.  The unit is, however, given a new name as its sediments were deposited in a basin distinct from those in which the Etadunna and Namba Formations were deposited.  The observation of units and lithologies identical to the Mount Sarah Sandstone, Mirackina Conglomerate and Garford Formation, interlayered within Etadunna Formation limestone and clays at Billa Kalina (G.J. Ambrose, SADME, pers. comm.) supports the suggestion of stratigraphic equivalence and essential contemporaneity of all four units.|
25918|Garford Formation|Age reasons|An early to mid-Miocene age has been established for sediments within the Namba Formation (Callen and Tedford, 1976). Preliminary searches for vertebrate fossils in the Garford Formation and for microfossils within drill core have been unsuccessful. Despite this, correlations with the Namba and Etadunna Formations are considered strong enough to suggest a Miocene or, at least, mid-Tertiary, age for the Garford Formation.|

7458|Glyde Hill Volcanic Complex|Constituents|Pag3 Dacite, Pag2 Rhyodacite, Wheepool Rhyolite (defined below) Pag1 Rhyolite, Yandoolka Rhyolite (defined below). The unit Pag3 consists of porphyritic dacite grading into rhyodacite and may be equivalent in age to the Yardea Dacite, though probably erupted from a separate centre. The unit either overlies or is a facies variant of unit Pag2. It rests upon the Wheepool Rhyolite 7 km north-northwest of Wheepool wells, the base being marked by a weathered layer of tuff. The unit Pag2 is mainly reddish brown porphyritic rhyodacite with scattered phenocrysts of pink potash feldspar up to 1 cm long, locally grading into dacite. The lower part is fine grained with rare small feldspar phenocrysts. The rhyodacite overlies the Wheepool Rhyolite north of Lake Everard H.S. and southeast of Dingo Hill; and also the basal (Pag1) west of Glyde Hill outstation. East of the outstation, the unit either rests upon or passes into the Wheepool Rhyolite. Southeast of Dingo Hill and eastwards into Lake Gairdner, the rhyodacite either passes into, or is overlain by the Yardea Dacite. The unit Pag1 includes fine grained pale yellowish and cream coloured banded rhyolite and rhyolitic welded ash flow tuff, cropping out in the area west of Glyde Hill outstation for aboaut 25 km westwarads. The rhyolite is overlain by the rhyodacite unit Pag2. The base is not exposed, but the unit is probably at least 20 m thick. The rhyolite may be equivalent to pale reddish brown banded rhyolite underlying Yardea Dacite on the western shore of Lake Acraman, about 45 km to the southeast.|

9477|Keswick Clay|Unit history|Allchurch (1965) referred to this unit as 'Mottled Clay'. Ward (1966) equated this unit with the Ngaltinga Clay (Noarlunga & Willunga Embayments). Firman (1966), Allchurch (1967) includes this unit with Hindmarsh Clay. Selby & Lindsay (1982) referred to this unit as the 'Upper Member' of Hindmarsh Clay and also cite 'Cadelaide Clay' as a common usage informal name.|
9477|Keswick Clay|Type section locality|Keswick Railway Yards cutting, 4-5 m of green-grey stiff plastic clay, variously mottled with reddish ferruginous colours is exposed over a 1.8 km distance (Ward, 1966). The base rests disconformably on Hindmarsh Clay (brownish) and is overlain by solonised brown soil - carbonate rich. Type drill hole: 5.2 metres of greenish-grey (5GY 6/1) to light olive-grey (5Y 6/1) stiff plastic clay; intersected in cored hole GH03 (SADME Core Library no. 662800301773), Metro-Adelaide Soil Investigations (Colour Names - Kelly & Judd, 1976; Colour notation - Munsell, 1975). The drill site is 180 m east of the Type Section and 450 m north of Greenhill Road, Wayville, in the South West Park Lands, Hundred of Adelaide.|
9477|Keswick Clay|Extent|The unit covers an area of 150 km2 on the eastern margin of the St Vincent Basin. It is extensively developed in the Adelaide/Golden Grove Embayment, onlaps the Para Block and is more restricted on the Edan Block (Ward, 1966); Firman 1969a; Daily et al., 1976|
9477|Keswick Clay|Thickness range|Range 0.5 to 6.8 metres.|
9477|Keswick Clay|Lithology|Clay; silty to gritty (quartz sand), texture range - light to heavy, often with waxy lustre. Generally ;massive, poorly bedded, with steep and shallow angle slicken sided fissures often apparent. Gligai structures are common in the upper parts of the unit. jSand lenses and silty zones proximal to ephemeral creek lines are common. Colour range yellow-greys to green-greys, mottles - reddish to yellowish. X-ray diffraction studies indicate predominant Smectite mineralogy, less dominant Illite and randomly interstratified clays.|
9477|Keswick Clay|Depositional environment|aeolian' (Ward, 1966), "terrestrial alluvial fan deposit" Firman (1969a). Present investigations imply two origins: terrestrial alluvial fan overbank sedimentation (Adelaide/Golden Grove Embayment); in situ bedrock weathering and minimal transport (Para and Eden Blocks). Mineralogy and morphology suggest clay derived by deep weathering during period of tectonic stability, subsequent clay erosion on reactivation of teactonic movement and a probable climate change. No evidence for aeolian origin is revealed by micromorphological studies.|
9477|Keswick Clay|Relationships and boundaries|Stratigraphically it overlies Hindmarsh Clay (Firman, 1966; Taylor et al., 1974), its basal contact is disconformable (Selby & Lindsay, 1982) and ranges from sharp to diffuse. The upper contact is sharp when overlain by calcareous Red-Brown Earths/Brown Solonised soils but gradational with overlying Black Earth soils. Its western limit is marked by the Para Fault escarpment. South and east the limits are less well defined due to interfingering with other gleyed alluvial/colluvial deposits associated with the Eden-Burnside Fault escarpment. Isolated irregular remnants occur in bedrock depressions on the upthrown Eden & Para Blocks, Sheard & Bowman (1987).|

24335|Kilburn Sand|Name source|Unit named after the Adelaide suburb of Kilburn; Grid reference 795390, Adelaide 6628-III, 1:50 000 sheet, Zone 54.|
24335|Kilburn Sand|Unit history|Kilburn Sand has been informally referred to as "older dune sands near Gepps Cross" by Bowman and Sheard (1988).|
24335|Kilburn Sand|Type section locality|1.0 m of reddish brown well sorted quartz sand exposed in a cutting within Irish Harp Reserve, off Regency Road, Prospect, (section 367, Hundred of Yatala, Grid reference: 793381, Adelaide 6628-III). The Kilburn sand dune ridge is approximately 90 m wide at this location and rises to about 2 m above the level of the surrounding plain. Reference Section:  1.13 m of non calcareous, unfossiliferous, well sorted quartz sand with a sandy clay soil B horizon between 230 and 440 mm depth. Colour - uniform dark brown (7.5 YR 3/4 to 7.5 YR 3.5/4, moist), soil B horizon is reddish brown (5 YR 4/3, moist). Proposed reference section is cored hole GH 91 from the Metro-Adelaide Soils Investigations; SADME Core Library number 662840002062. This hole is located in the Irish Harp Reserve adjacent to the Type Section.|
24335|Kilburn Sand|Extent|The unit is exposed as a composite linear dune ridge, 200 to 300 m west of the Para Fault escarpment, running from Dudley Park (south) to Gepps Cross west of the Para Fault escarpment, running from Dudley Park (south) to Gepps Cross (north). The areal extent is approximately 4 square km.|
24335|Kilburn Sand|Thickness range|range <0.30 to 1.80 m.|
24335|Kilburn Sand|Lithology|Kilburn Sand has been extensively affected by soil development. Sand mineralogy consists of about 91% subrounded quartz grains; 5% feldspar grains and minor lithics, heavy minerals; and a trace of muscovite. Lithic grains are more abundant than for the Fulham Sand (Bowman and Sheard, 1988). Kilburn sand grains are moderately well rounded, few are frosted and iron oxides/clay fill grain depressions and/or form grain coatings. The sand is fine well sorted, with a significant clay-silt fraction (25 to 50%); mean size range from 31.2 micron sediment = 2.78 phi (146 microns) with standard deviation of 0.97 phi. Skewness of distribution = -0.11 to +0.17. Kurtosis (peakedness) of the Kilburn Sand is mesokurtic (-0.70 to +0.29) - distinctively different from the Fulham Sand as redefined by Bowman and Sheard (1988).|
24335|Kilburn Sand|Depositional environment|Aeolian, based on granulometric character, unit morphology, distribution, topography and stratigraphy. Sediment sources are possibly the River Torrens alluvial fan, Dry Creek alluvial fan, or reworked Pooraka Formation. High lithic-silt/clay content reflects a terrigenous source and lack of marine reworking.|
24335|Kilburn Sand|Relationships and boundaries|Kilburn Sand overlies Quaternary alluvium, carbonate silt deposits and forms part of the Enfield Soil Association of Aitchison et al (1954). The upper boundary is unconfined except where overlain by anthropogenic deposits.|
24335|Kilburn Sand|Age reasons|Kilburn Sand is unfossiliferous. It stratigraphically overlies Quaternary alluvium and the Pookaka Fm (dated at 35 K A: Williams, 1969). On pedologic grounds Kilburn Sand is probably older than Fulham Sand (about 16-20kA; Bowman and Sheard, 1988). Probable age 20 to 30 kA; poor soil development in surrounding drift sand indicates more recent reworking of sediment.|

24336|Kingscote Limestone|Name source|The richly fossiliferous yellow to buff limestones exposed at Kingscote between the jetty at Beare Point and Brownlow Beach (Figs 2, 3) have never been formally designated as a stratigraphic unit distinct from the more continuous but partly time-correlative units exposed in Aldinga and Maslin Bays.|
24336|Kingscote Limestone|Type section locality|Typical Kingscote Limestone is exposed in the coastal cliffs and associated shore platforms at Kingscote, sections 406 and 407 hundred of Menzies; a measured type section is designated 150 m southwest of the swimming pool. Another important section occurs at the base of cliffs at "Table Rock" near Point Reynolds, section H hundred of Haines, but it is difficult to access except at low tide. Important subsurface sections of Kingscote Limestone were penetrated by the E. & W.S. Dept Pumphouse bore (Fig. 4), drilled in 1962 6 km southwest of Kingscote (section 46 hundred of Menzies); and by the Engineer-in-Chief's Kingscote bore, drilled in 1909-10 1 km north of Beare Point (section J1 hundred of Menzies).|
24336|Kingscote Limestone|Extent|On Kangaroo Island at Kingscote, Cygnet River, Freestone Creek and Point Reynolds. In addition, a succession comparable with the Eocene part of the Kingscote Limestone has been recognised in Beach Petroleum Troubridge Shoal No. 1 borehole between 229 m and 259 m (Ludbrook 1963; Stuart 1970). The Kingscote section comprises three lithologically distinguishable units: the lowest consisting of echinoid-rich limestones capped by a rubbly mollusc-rich conglomerate of Late Eocene age; an intermediate bioclastic limestone of latest Eocene to Middle Oligocene age; and an upper unit of well-bedded to flaggy and cross-bedded bioclastic limestones of Late Oligocene age. For practical purposes all are best included for the time being in the Kingscote Limestone. However, they have lithological and chronological counterparts in the Port Willunga Formation on the eastern side of Gulf St Vincent. The lowest unit of the Kingscote Limestone, of Late Eocene age, is on faunal evidence, a correlative of the Tortachilla Limestone and at least part of the  Blanche Point Formation in the eastern St Vincent Basin; while in terms of units on eastern Yorke Peninsula (Stuart 1970) it correlates faunally with Muloowurtie Formation, Throoka Silts, and perhaps the basal part of Rogue Formation. A summary of contributions to correlations within the St Vincent Basin was provided by Cooper (1979).|
24336|Kingscote Limestone|Thickness range|In the coastal exposures in the type section, 4.5 m; in the Kingscote bore, 25-30 m; in the Pumphouse bore, approximately 50 m.|
24336|Kingscote Limestone|Lithology|Bioclastic limestone, with a thin basal bed of pebbly quartzose greensand (not exposed but penetrated in the Pumphouse bore).|
24336|Kingscote Limestone|Age reasons|Late Eocene to Late Oligocene.|

Base: 16 m siltstone, dark grey, weathering brown, very finely laminated.|
27065|Kirwan Siltstone|Relationships and boundaries|The Kirwan Siltstone conformably and gradationally overlies correlatives of the Arkaba Hill Beds (Mount, 1980) and is conformably overlain by the Waraco Limestone.|
27065|Kirwan Siltstone|Identifying features|A mappable marker of laminated carbonaceous siltstones, lying conformably between the Arkaba Hill Beds (below) and Waraco Limestone (above), in the core complex of the Worumba Anticline.|
27065|Kirwan Siltstone|Age reasons|Inferred to be Willouran.|
27065|Kirwan Siltstone|Correlations|The Kirwan Siltstone is similar in lithology to dark-coloured carbonaceous siltstones in many diapirs, and also to the lower units of the River Broughton Beds type section in the Spalding Inlier (Preiss, 1974). However, the Kirwan Siltstone cannot be easily distinguished from other siltstone units (e.g. lower Arkaba Hill Beds, Wirrawilka Beds, Worumba Dolomite Beds), on lithololgy alone, when out of stratigraphic context.|

11173|Mangaroongah Dacite|Name source|From Mangaroongah paddock on Lake Everard station. Mangaroongah Dacite is the only volcanic rock type occurring in Mangaroongah paddock. The centre of the paddock is at 31o51' latitude, 135o06' longitude.|
11173|Mangaroongah Dacite|Type section locality|It is not possible to propose a type section that adequately reveals the Mangaroongah Dacite from base to top. However the type area is Palthrobie Hill located at 31o47' lat. And 135o12.5' longitude. The upper contact is well exposed immediately to the north of Lake Everard homestead.|
11173|Mangaroongah Dacite|Extent|Exposed over an area of 170 km2 in the central eastern portion of the Childara 1:250 000 sheet area and in the extreme south-western portion of the Gairdner 1:250 000 sheet area.|
11173|Mangaroongah Dacite|Lithology|In hand specimen a dark brown-red porphyry, containing medium to fine grained phenocrysts of plagioclase, K feldspar and patches of green chlorite after clinopyroxene, sitting in an aphanitic groundmass. In thin section the feldspar phenocrysts are largely altered to sericite and have been corroded during devitrification. Fine grained clinopyroxene (augite) is scattered throughout and in places has been altered to chlorite and serpentine. Plagioclase phenocrysts are dominant, while quartz phenocrysts are absent. Phenocrysts make up to 20% of the rock. The groundmass texture is microlitic, with randomly oriented microlites of alkali feldspar interlocking with magnetite, chlorite and aphanitic material that is stained red with limonite, hence giving the rock its red-brown colour. Total feldspar phenocrysts exceed those of augite by 4:1. Locally more acid variants occur with modal quartz as do more basic variants which have a dark green colour and contain a higher % of augite. The upper zone of this unit is highly vesicular, containing flattened vesicles filled with vapour phase minerals such as actinolite, chlorite, epidote, quartz, calcite. Origin: A strongly welded crystal-vitric tuff of ashflow origin. Complete devitrification has obscured original textures.|
11173|Mangaroongah Dacite|Relationships and boundaries|Conformably overlies the Childera Dacite, often separated by a white airfall tuff bed from this unit. Contact with younger Aburee Rhyolite is complex, but upper zones of Mangaroongah Dacite are invariably highly vesicular, with the development of vapour phase minerals. Thickness at least 200 m.|

24617|Moolawatana Suite|Unit history|Moolawatana was first used by David (1926) as Moolawatana Glacial beds, a term no longer used and now superseded.|
24617|Moolawatana Suite|Type section locality|The best section exhibitiing all five phases can be seen between Petermorra Springs to White Well Bore to Wattleowie Hut ruins to Birthday Well.|
24617|Moolawatana Suite|Extent|The three main phases of granite emplacement (Yerila Granite, Wattleowie Granite and Terrapinna Granite) occur widely in both the Mount Babbage and Mount Painter Inliers, the Terrapinna Granite predominating. The minor phases (Prospect Hill Granite and White Well Granite) are restricted to the Mount Babbage Inlier. Granitoids of the Moolawatana Suite are believed to be extensive in the subsurface north and east of the two inliers (Callen et al., 1990; Sheard and Cockshell, 1992).|
24617|Moolawatana Suite|Lithology|The Moolawatana Suite consists of complex of coeval felsic intrusive rock types. Three main and two minor rock type phases are evident in the well exposed Mount Babbage Inlier. Primary textures and composition vary within the three major lithotypes, which have been further modified with the development of a pervasive mica foliation during the Delamerian Orogeny.  The five phases are: 1. Yerila Granite: lineated tabular feldspar granite, usually melanocratic, and composed of microcline laths, albite, quartz, biotite and muscovite, with accessory apatite, zircon and tourmaline. Shown as map symbol pCy on the Mount Painter Province 1:125 000 geological map (Coats and Blissett, 1971).  2. Wattleowie Granite: weakly gneissic, coarse-grained white granite and adamellite, and composed of microcline, quartz, oligoclase, albite, and biotite, with accessory zircon, apatite and opaque grains. Shown as map symbol pCw on the Mount Painter Province 1:125 000 geological map (Coats and Blissett, 1971).  3. Terrapinna Granite: massive pink-weathering grey to white very coarse-grained rapakivi granite to adamellite, and composed of ovoid microcline and round quartz phenocrysts set in a coarse-grained mosaic of K-feldspar, quartz, biotite, muscovite, and albite, with accessory tourmaline, opaques, apatite and zircon. Shown as map unit symbol pCt on the Mount Painter Province 1:125 000 geological map (Coats and Blissett, 1971).  4. Prospect Hill Granite: as defined (M.J. Sheard, C.M. Fanning and R.B. Flint 1992, South Australia).  5. White Well Granite: as defined (Geological Survey Quarterly Geological Notes, 123: 18-31).|
24617|Moolawatana Suite|Relationships and boundaries|Within the Mount Babbage Inlier intrusives of the suite form a series of east-west elongate bodies - a distribution pattern in part due to effects of the Delamerian Orogeny. Yerila Granite is considered the oldest granitoid, it is intruded by Terrapinna Granite, with xenoliths of Yerila Granite in both the Wattleowie and Terrapinna Granites. Xenoliths of Wattleowie Granite also occur in Terrapinna Granite (Coats and Bliissett, 1971; Sheard and Callen (in prep.). Xenoliths are usually restricted to within 1-10 m of an intrusive contact. In most cases contacts between the various phases are sharp, however, contacts between Wattleowie and Terrapinna Granites range from sharp to diffuse. All intrusive phases are cross-cut by related coarse-grained pegmatite dykes which are usually moderately deformed. Younger pegmatite dykes, which are only weakly deformed are related to the Cambrian-Ordovician Mudnawatana Tonalite (Teale, 1979).  Both the Prospect Hill and White Well Granites intrude the Petermorra Volcanics, and their characteristics are consistent with intrusion at high levels within the crust. Their relationship to each other and the three other phases is not known. The Yerila, Wattleowie and Terrapinna Granites probably represent deeper level intrusions. Their contacts with older (?Palaeoproterozoic) basement metasediments are also intrusive, with numerous rafts of metasediments.|
24617|Moolawatana Suite|Age reasons|More robust U-Pb zircon analyses are given in Johnson (1980), Thornton (1980), sites 1 and 2 respectively on Figure 2, and Cooper et al. (1982). The Yerila Granite has an upper concordia intercept of 1556+/-10 Ma (Johnson, 1980, and as modified by Cooper et al., 1982), whilst a melanocratic phase, we consider to be equivalent to the Terrapinna Granite, has an upper intercept of 1556+/-4 Ma (Thornton, 1980). The lower concordia intercepts of 344+/-23 Ma and 77+/-11 Ma respectively may reflect younger Pb loss events as discussed by Cooper et al. (1982). It must be noted that bulk zircon fractions containing many millions of grains were analysed and so the ages may be biased by the inclusion of grains not formed in total at the time of primary igneous crystallisation. Never the less, the ages of 1556+/-10 Ma and 1556+/-4 Ma provide the best estimates for the crystallisation ages of the Yerila and Terrapinna Granites.  Terrapinna Granite in Skelton 2: A homogeneous population of zircons was separated from sample 6938 RS 25, Terrapinna Granite in Skeleton 2. The zircons are in general structureless clear grains, a deep hyacinth in colour and with pyramidal terminations, or are fractured parts of such grains. The zircons are interpreted to have a simple igneous origin.  It is consluded from the data at hand that Palaeozoic event(s) have influenced the loss of radiogenic Pb for some of the more discordant zircon analyses from sample 6938 RS 25. The best estimate for the crystallisation age of the zircons is given by those that have suffered little or no loss of radiogenic Pb, or Pb loss near the present day. The upper intercept of 1557+/-6 Ma for the regression line fitted to five of the six analyses with essentially a zero lower intercept (Fig. 4d) is interpreted as the crystallisation age for the zircons and enclosing Terrapinna Granite in Skeleton 2.  The Mount Babbage and Mount Painter Inliers, represent a former northwesterly extension of the Curnamona Craton. Volcanics within the inliers have a broadly similar stratigraphic position and geochemistry to those of the Curnamona Craton and Gawler Craton (Giles and Teale, 1979, 1981). However, from recent U-Pb zircon isotopic studies (as presented here) a much more complicated Mesoproterozoic succession can be inferred with probably several volcano-sedimentary sequences (Fig. 5). A succession in the Mount Painter Inlier, including the Pepegoona Porphyry, parts of the Mount Neill Granite Porphyry, Freeling Heights Quartzite and Yagdlin Phyllite of Coats and Blissett (1971) has an age of ~1575 Ma.|
24617|Moolawatana Suite|Correlations|Outcrops of porphyritic rhyolite from Harts Creek and dacitic tuff near the Gunsight Prospect have U-Pb zircon crystallisation ages of 1576+/-2 and 1575+/-14 Ma (Teale, in prep. b). This is significantly younger than the extrusive age of ~1592 Ma for the Gawler Range Volcanics of the Gawler Craton and ?volcanism of the Curnamona Craton. The Petermorra Volcanics of the northern Mount Babbage Inlier represent yet another, younger, volcano-sedimentary sequence with an age of 1560+/-2 Ma. High-level plutons of the Prospect Hill Granite and White Well Granite intrude the sequence. Neither has been dated, but are assumed to be of similar age to other, deeper-level granitoids in the region that have statistically identical U-Pb zircon ages of 1556+/-4, 1556+/-10 and 1557+/-6 Ma; the Terrapinna Granite, Yerila Granite and adamellite in Skeleton 2 respectively. Along with the Wattleowie Granite, the Terrapinna Granite, Yerila Granite, Prospect Hill Granite and White Well Granite collectively define the cogenetic, anorogenic Moolawatana Suite.  The Petermorra Volcanics and marginally younger widespread intrusives of the Moolawatana Suite thus form a major episode of volcano-plutonic activity at 1560-1555 Ma in the Mount Babbage and Mount Painter Inliers and also probably in the northern Curnamona Craton. This activity is significantly younger than both the ~1575 Ma and 1590 Ma igneous episodes.|23/APR/09

28251|Nildottie Siltstone Member|Type section locality|460 metres of red siltstone, with minor red shale and sandstone, exposed in an area of undulatory topography 2.5 km north of Ten Mile Creek, from latitude 31o15'47"S, longitude 138o49'43"E (bottom) to latitude 31o15'43"S, longitude 138o50'07"E (top).|
28251|Nildottie Siltstone Member|Extent|The unit is exposed over approximately 50 km2 in the central Flinders Ranges (along the Heysen Range, at Mernmerna, between Wirrealpa and the Ten Mile Creek, near Mount Frome and adjacent to Chambers Gorge), on the Parachiulna 1:250 000 Geological Sheet (SH 54-13).  It also outcrops over approximately 15 km2 in the Mount Scott Range, on the western portion of the Copley 1:250 000 Geological Sheet (SH 54-9).|
28251|Nildottie Siltstone Member|Thickness range|150-470 m|
28251|Nildottie Siltstone Member|Lithology|Red siltstone, with minor shale and fine sandstone. Evenly lamiantaed to ripple laminated. Contains abundant desiccation cracks and halite casts.|
28251|Nildottie Siltstone Member|Relationships and boundaries|The Nildottie Siltstone Member is the middle member of the Billy Creek Formation in the central Flinders Ranges and at Mount Scott. Generally, it rests conformably on the Warragee Member of the Billy Creek Formation. However, in the southern portion of the Wirrealpa Basin south of the Ten Mile Creek graben, the Warragee Member is absent and the Nildottie Siltstone Member rests directly and with possible disconformity on Wilkawillina Limestone. In all outcrops, the Nildottie Siltstone Member is sharply but conformably overlain by red sandstone of the Ereguna Sandstone Member.|
28251|Nildottie Siltstone Member|Age reasons|The Billy Creek Formation is Lower to Middle Cambarian in ae (Daily, 1956), however the position of the Lower-Middle Cambrian boundary occurs at an undefined position in the upper portion of the formation. It is likely therefore that the Nildottie Siltstone Member is largely, if not entirely, late Lower Cambarian in age.|

26083|Nuckulla Basalt|Name source|From Nuckulla Hill, located 6 km west of the main basalt outcrop. Nuckulla well is located adjacent to the main basalt outcrop. Nuckulla Hill is at 31o43.5' latitude and 134o51.25' longitude. Origin: As a series of lava flows of limited areal extent.|
26083|Nuckulla Basalt|Type section locality|A north-south section running for a distance of 1.25 km, 2 km west of Nuckulla well. Nuckulla well is at 31o43.75' latitude and 134o56.5' longitude.|
26083|Nuckulla Basalt|Extent|A small localised outcrop in the fara east of the Childara 1:250 000 Sheet area. Area covered is roughly 2.5 km2.|
26083|Nuckulla Basalt|Lithology|A green, non variable aphanitic rock. In thin section the rock is composed of strongly oriented plagioclase laths interlocking with unresolvable, altered groundmass material which appears devitrified. The plagioclase is altered, untwinned and makes up 60% of the rock. Scattered throughout are minute, euhedral clinopyroxene crystals - these are not interlocking with the plagioclase, but appear to have grown later. Chlorite and hornblende has replaced much of the clinopyroxene, which makes up a total of 25% of the rock. Scattered euhedral opaques (probably magnetite) make up 5% of the rock. Unresolvable matrix forms the remaining 10% of the rock. The unit becomes notably vesicular in its upper zones. The vesicularity increases until a 6 m band of poorly welded lithic-vitric ashflow tuff (with a variety of lithic fragments of lapilli size) is reached. This unit is definitely the lateral equivalent of the Waurea Pyroclastics.|
26083|Nuckulla Basalt|Relationships and boundaries|Conformably overlies the Bunburn Dacite and is separated from this unit by a 10 m thickness of airfall tuff and strongly welded ashflow tuff which may be the lateral equivalent of the Waurea Pyroclastics. Maximum thickness 80m, although the unit thins rapidly to the east and west.|
26083|Nuckulla Basalt|Age reasons|Forms part of the mid-Carpentarian Glyde Hill Complex as defined by Blissett.|

14485|Observatory Hill Formation|Name source|From Observatory Hill (latitude 28o58'06"S, longitude 132o03'42"E) on the Giles 1:250 000 topographic map.|
14485|Observatory Hill Formation|Unit history|This unit was named by Wopfner (1969) as 'Observatory Hill Beds'. Krieg (1973) extended Wopfner's description to include outcrop in the Mount Johns Range, 250 km to the northeast. The unit is now recognised in many drillholes over a wide area (Fig. 4), demonstrating lateral continuity and consistency of lithology, and allowing formation status to be applied.  Two members and a marker horizon are recognised within the Observatory Hill Formation. These are the Oolarinna Member (Benbow, 1982) the Moyles Chert Marker, and the Parakeelya Alkali Member (described herein).|
14485|Observatory Hill Formation|Type section locality|Twenty metres of outcrop at latitude 28o58.2'S, longitude 131o57.7'E as described by Wopfner (1969) and the interval 0 to 155.25 m in Observatory Hill-1 which was spudded just above the base of Wopfner's section (Gatehouse and Hibburt, 1987).|
14485|Observatory Hill Formation|Description at type locality|Reference Section:  Byilkaoora-1 (latitude 27o16'47.8"S, longitude 133o24.1"E), 155.8 to 379.4 m.|
14485|Observatory Hill Formation|Extent|The Observatory Hill Formation crops out at scattered localities in a northeast-southwest trending belt running from the Mount Johns Range to Observatory Hill and Lake Maurice (Benbow, 1982, 1986; Krieg, 1973; Wopfner, 1968; Pitt, 1983). Drillhole intersections extend the distribution of the formation to the south and north of the outcrop belt (Fig. 4).|
14485|Observatory Hill Formation|Thickness range|Ranges from 178 m to in excess of 494 m in the Marla area and from 178 m to more than 294 m in the Emu area.|
14485|Observatory Hill Formation|Lithology|The Observatory Hill Formation consists of multicoloured micaceous siltstone and claystone, calcareous and dolomitic in part, with minor light yellow brown very fine-grained sandstone and light grey to dark grey limestone and dolomite. The siltstone and claystone are dominantly red brown to brown in colour but range through purple and greenish grey to dark grey, especially where they are interbedded with the carbonates. The carbonates are concentrated at three levels within the formation and make up the Moyles Chert Marker, the Parakeelya Alkali Member and an unnamed unit found near the base of the Observatory Hill Fm in the Emu area. With the exception of the Oolarinna Member (Benbow, 1982), the fine-grained red-bed clastaics of the Observatory Hill Formation have not been subdivided into members. Moyles Chert Marker Bed: A unit of greenish grey to dark grey limestone, dolomite and siltstone, ranging from 8 to 20 m thick and containing abundant chert nodules, lenses, and fragments occurs near the top of the Observatory Hill Fm. This Bed forms a distinctive horizon which has been recognised in outcrop in the vicinity of the Mount Johns Range and Wallatinna Homestead (Benbow, 1982), and in most drillholes in the Marla and Emu areas. Its name is derived from Moyles Dam, Wantapella 1:100 000 sheet, latitude 27o28'30"s, longitude 133o20'15"E. It is not present in the type section where the top of the Observatory Hill Fm has been eroded but can be seen from 200.00 to 213.1 m in the Byilkaoora-1 reference section. Parakeelya Akali Member: A second, thicker, carbonate-rich section which is encountered 30 to 40 m below the Moyles Chert Marker. The name has been derived from Parakeelya Bore, Marla 1:100 000 sheet, latitude 27o24'36", longitude 133o33'06" (Fig. 5). It consists of a distinctive sequence of laminated to thinly bedded, dominantly light brownish grey and greenish grey to dark grey, limestone, dolomite, siltstone and claystone, characterised by the presence of: i) abundant desiccation features; ii) chert lenses, nodules and fragments; iii) calcite and dolomite crusts.  The Parakeelya Alkali Member type section can be seen from 240.0 to 334.5 m in Byilkaoora-1 in the Marla area where calcite pseudomorphs after alkali evaportite minerals (Pitt et al. 1979; White and Youngs, 1980) occur. The Parakeelya Alkali Member is thinner and less well developed in the Emu area but is still clearly recognisable. It contains a higher proportion of clastics than in the Marla area and calcite pseudomorphs of alkali evaporite minerals are less common. Intersections indicate that the Parakeelya Alkali Member maintains a fairly constant thickness over wide areas (80-100 m in the Marla area, 60-70 m in the Emu area) but can lens out abruptly (as seen in exposure in the Mount Johns Range). The 22.7 m of outcrop at the Observatory Hill Fm type section lies within the Parakeelya Alkali Member; an additional 39.3 m was intersected in Observatory Hill-1, a total of 62 m.|
14485|Observatory Hill Formation|Depositional environment|The carbonate-rich sections preserve features indicative of deposits from shallow water subject to exposure, desiccation and local brine overprints. The presence of alkali evaporite pseudomorphs is key evidence of a continenntal playa system. The red-beds surrounding the pllaya sediments are not so clearly indicative of environments but probably represents arid terrestrial deposits. The extension of the terrestrial red-beds into a marginal sabkha setting is evidenced by interbedding with shallow marine carbonates of the underlying Ouldburra Formation in the Marla-Manya area.|
14485|Observatory Hill Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The Observatory Hill Formation in the Mount Johns area is conformably overlain by the Arcoeillinna Sandstone (Benbow, 1982). The upper boundary is placed at the base of the first major sandstone which overlies red-brown claystone and siltstone of the Oolarinna Member. In the Marla-Manya area the Observatory Hill Formation lies conformably to locally disconformably on the Ouldburra Formation. A lateral intertonguing relationship with the Wallatinna Formation is observed in exposures in the Mount Johns Range (Benbow, 1982).  In the Emu area the Observatory Hill Formation conformably to disconformably overlies the Relief Sandastone and unconformably overlies the Adelaidean Rodda beds.|
14485|Observatory Hill Formation|Age reasons|Uncertain, but stratigraphically younger than the Ouldburra Formation (Early Cambrian) and overlain by an extensive development of shallow marine-fluvial clastics, dominated by sandstone, interpreted as Late Cambrian-Devonian (Krieg, 1973).|

26319|Ouldburra Formation|Name source|From Ouldburra Hill (latitude 27o31'00"S, longitude 133o55'00"E approximately) on the Wintinna 1:250 000 topographic map.|
26319|Ouldburra Formation|Unit history|Originally correlated with the Observatory Hill beds (Pitt et al., 1980; Benbow, 1982) as described by Wopfner (1969).|
26319|Ouldburra Formation|Type section locality|Manya-6, (latitude 27o40'08"S, longitude 133o42'59.7"E), 571.4 to 1685.6 m.|
26319|Ouldburra Formation|Extent|The Ouldburra Formation is not known to crop out, however it has been intersected in numerous drillholes in the Marla-Manya area (Figure 6). Marine carbonates intersected in SADME drillholes Marla-1A, 1B, Mount Willoughby-1, and Manya-1 were previously correlated with the Observatory Hill beds (Pitt et al., 1980) but are now assigned to the Ouldburra Formation. Similar carbonates and evaporites intersected in the drillhole Wilkinson-1, to the southwest, are probable correlatives of the Ouldburra Formation.|
26319|Ouldburra Formation|Thickness range|Maximum known thickness is in the type section of 1114.2 m, but considerable variation is observed. Drillhole Marla-3 penetrated a complete basin margin section of only 142.6 m. Figure 6 shows the present known distribution and thickness of the unit from drillhole intersections.|
26319|Ouldburra Formation|Lithology|The Ouldburra Formation consists of mixed carbonates/siliciclastics, marine carbonates and evaporites. In the type section, the basal unit is typified by halite and sandstone grading up to stacked sand/silt/mudstone sets which become increasingly calcareous. These units are overlain by a thick sequence of calcareous and dolomitic carbonates with sporadic clastics and gypsum/anhydrite interbeds. The carbonate lithofacies are dominated by laminated and silty carbonate mudstone but include wackestone, packstone, minor grainstone, stromatolitic and thrombolitic algal bindstone, and archaeocyath bafflestone/framestone. The top of the formation is typically an interdigitation of laminated carbonate mudstones and red-bed siltstones with abundant nodular sulphate evaporite and bedded 'chicken-wire' anhydrite.|
26319|Ouldburra Formation|Depositional environment|In the Manya area, deposition began with the precipitation of bottom-nucleated halite in small isolated salinas on a peri-emergent sand flat. This was followed by a series of widespread transgressions and regressions of restricted shallow marine waters over a flanking carbonate sabkha. Ooid shoals, algal/carbonate mud mounds and archaeocyath/algal bioherms were developed offshore. The flanking sabkha was characterised by near-surface dolomitisation, the growth of displacive 'chicken-wire' anhydrite within the emergent sediment profile and, ultimately, the deposition of red-bed sediments.|
26319|Ouldburra Formation|Relationships and boundaries|The Ouldburra Formation conformably overlies the Relief Sandstone. The contact is defined as the bottom of the lowermost carbonate unit, siltstone or halite bed. The upper boundary is taken as the top of the uppermost carbonate unit underlying the gypsiferous red-beds of the lower portion of the Observatory Hill Formation.|
26319|Ouldburra Formation|Age reasons|Regular and irregular archaeocyaths enable an Early Cambrian (?Botoman) age to be inferred.|

28186|Palthrubie Granophyre|Name source|From Palthrubie hill, 6.5 km southeast of Lake Everard homestead on Gairdner 1:250 000 Sheet area. Palthrubie hill is located at 31o47' latitude and 135o12.5' longitude. Origin: This unit is intrusive into the Mangaroongah Dacite, as evidenced by its outcrop pattern (circular and plug-like) and chilled margins. The well developed granophyric texture indicates that this unit is a shallow intrusive.|
28186|Palthrubie Granophyre|Type section locality|The centre of the intrusive plug is located at 31o46' latitude and 135o12' longitude.|
28186|Palthrubie Granophyre|Extent|Small circular outcrop 2 km in diameter, the centre of which is 3 km southeast of Lake Everard homestead.|
28186|Palthrubie Granophyre|Lithology|An orange weathering rock of medium grainsize, containing only quartz and K feldspar. This unit outcrops as reounded tors, typical of granite. In thin section a granophyric intergrowth of quartz and K feldspar is the most characteristic feature. The quartz occurs as euhedral, fine grained blebs within the K feldspar. These blebs are arranged in an ordered pattern, aligned along crystallographic directions in the K feldspar. Elsewhere K feldspar and quartz grains form a granular aggregate, showing no intergrowth. The K feldspar is strongly stained with limonite, giving the rock its characteristic reddish-orange colour in fresh specimen. The K feldspar has been extensively sericitized.|
28186|Palthrubie Granophyre|Relationships and boundaries|An intrusive plug. Intrusive into the Mangaroongah Dacite. This unit is petrographically distinct from the intrusive Yandoolka Rhyolite (as defined by Blissett) which outcrops nearby.|
28186|Palthrubie Granophyre|Age reasons|Co-magmatic with the Glyde Hill Complex volcanics. Undoubtedly the same age as the other intrusive plugs and dykes that intrude the complex. Probably the same age as the co-magmatic Hiltaba Granite (Blissett) and may be a local phase of this granite - to which it has a great geochemical resemblance.  Age mid-Carpentarian, slightly less than 1550 Ma.|

22621|Pando Formation|Unit history|Gatehouse (1983, 1986) included the sandstone lithotype (eg in Daralingie-1) in the Dullingari Group. The Moolalla-1 occurrence was referred questionably to the Dullingari Group (Taylor et al., 1991).|
22621|Pando Formation|Type section locality|Pando No. 1 well (1736-1933 m, logger's depth) represented in part by Cores 4, 5 and 6. The top is identified on the gamma ray log by rapid increase to 300API units and by grey-buff glauconitic sandstone in the basal 1.5 m of Core 4. The base has not been penetrated in the type section.|
22621|Pando Formation|Extent|Subsurface only. Distribution uncertain but ranges northeast from the Boxwood Depression to the Moomba Ridge; the formation has been intersected most often in the Daralingie 1:100 000 sheet area (6941).|
22621|Pando Formation|Thickness range|246+ m of section (55o dip) were drilled in Moolalla No. 1 well but maximum thickness is unknown.|
22621|Pando Formation|Lithology|Sandstone, grey-buff-pale green, fine- to coarse-grained with abundant glauconite and detrital zircon. The sandstone is bioturbated with penetrative burrows resembling Chondrites. Interbeds of grey-buff slightly pyritic siltstone occur. Shale intersected in other drillholes (eg Boxwood-1) is also included in the Pando Formation. Shale is olive-green to grey with disseminated glauconite and patchy carbonate cement. Interbeds of ripple laminated ?tuffaceous fine grained sandstone are common. The shale is weakly bioturbated.|
22621|Pando Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Underlain by steeply dipping quartzite of unknown age in Daralingie-1. Overlain conformably by or interbedded with Mooracoochie Volcanics (Gatehouse, 1983) in Boxweed-1. Overlain unconformably by Permian sediments in most wells (e.g. Pando-1, Pando North-1, Daralingie-1, Moolalla-1).|
22621|Pando Formation|Age reasons|Pando Formation is the oldest known unit in the Warburton Basin. It underlies and is interbedded with Mooracoochie Volcanics of Early Cambrian (pre-Templetonian) age. Penetrative burrows indicate that the Pando Formation is also Early Cambrian.|

24620|Petermorra Volcanics|Name source|From Petermorra Spring, 1.2 km northeast of Prospect Hill trig, northern Flinders Ranges, Moolawatana 1:100 000 and Callabonna 1:250 000 map sheets (TSAGG, 1986). Prospect Hill is the highest of a series of low hills rising ~100 m above the surrounding plains. Fringing the hills are a number of springs, including Petermorra Spring, which discharge from the Great Artesian Basin aquifer.|
24620|Petermorra Volcanics|Type section locality|Along a north-south line 500 m west of Prospect Hill trig and between Petermorra Creek and the Dog Proof Fence.|
24620|Petermorra Volcanics|Extent|Outcrop is restricted to a series of low east-west trending ridges in the Prospect Hill area.|
24620|Petermorra Volcanics|Thickness range|The true thickness is indeterminate due to the lack of primary layering, the presence of superimposed strong foliation, and folding of unknown magnitude.|
24620|Petermorra Volcanics|Lithology|The dominant rock type is porphyritic rhyolitic volcanics. Also present are volcaniclastic, epiclastic volcanic sandstone and sericitic sandstone. The volcanics have abundant ovoid phenocrysts (2-5 mm) of grey K-feldspar, mostly microcline and orthoclase, but also have some microperthite, sanidine, and plagioclase. Quartz phenocrysts (2-4 mm) occur in varying amounts and range from translucent grey to bluish in colour. The groundmass is fine grained, grey to dark yellowish grey, displaying a foliated granoblastic texture. It consists of quartz, K-feldspar, plagioclase and biotite with accessory apatite, zircon, monazite, allanite and tourmaline. The porphyritic lithotypes range in composition from ?dacite to rhyodacite through to rhyolite. Primary volcanic layering is poorly displayed, though broad compositional variations may reflect primary igneous layering. The porphyries have been deformed; recrystallisation of some feldspars and micas has resulted in a well developed muscovite-sericite foliation which is subvertical and trending 75o-105o magnetic. This unit is anomalously high in boron, with values ranging from 20-100 ppm. Pegmatite and quartz+tourmaline veins and dykes are both parallel to and cross-cut the foliation. The porphyry conformably overlies an unnamed sericitic sandstone member. This sandstone is a medium grained, pale greenish grey to pale grey, poorly bedded quartz-dominant unit with occasional pebbly zones (rounded clasts 3-5 mm diameter) with variable amounts of K-feldspar and sericite-muscovite, which together form less than 35% of the whole rock.|
24620|Petermorra Volcanics|Relationships and boundaries|The volcanics conformably overlie an unnamed sericitic metasandstone member with a sharp contact that is exposed in a small creek northwest of Prospect Hill trig. The volcanics are intruded by White Well Granite and Prospect Hill Granite. Contacts with other igneous and metasedimentary rocks at Prospect Hill are either faulted or concealed. Unconformably overlying the Petermorra Volcanics is the Adelaidean Shanahan Conglomerate Member of the Paralana Quartzite.|
24620|Petermorra Volcanics|Age reasons|The zircons from samples 6838 RS 675 and 678 form a relatively homogeneous population of deep hyacinth-coloured elongate grains with pyramidal terminations or fractured parts thereof. The grains are interpreted, on morphological grounds, to have formed from a single igneous crystallisation event. From a combined plot of the analyses of 6838 RS 675 together with those for 6838 RS 678. A regression line fitted to all twelve analyses has no excess scatter (MSWD of 1.1) with intercepts at 1560+/-2 Ma and 74+/-37 Ma. These two felsic volcanics therefore are considered to be coeval.|
24620|Petermorra Volcanics|Correlations|Highly deformed felsic volcanics at the northern end of the Mount Painter Inlier between Moolawatana Homestead and Mount Fitton may be of similar age to the Petermorra Volcanics. Other felsic volcanics in the Mount Painter Inlier, including those near the Gunsight Prospect, Mount Neill, Harts Creek and west of Freeling Heights represent an older succession (Teale, in prep. b). No correlatives of the Petermorra Volcanics are known in SA outside of the Mount Babbage Inlier. However, it is reasonable to assume that they may occur on the concealed northern margin of the Curnamona Craton east of the Mount Babbage and Mount Painter Inliers.|

24460|Point Ellen Formation|Unit history|Point Ellen Formation New stratigraphic unit.|
24460|Point Ellen Formation|Type section locality|The type section is exposed in the sea-cliffs at Point Ellen at the southwestern entrance to Vivonne Bay, in the Marine Board Reserve adjacent to section 106 hundred of Newland.|
24460|Point Ellen Formation|Extent|Limited to a small area at point Ellen, overlying Late Pliocene sediments in the "Table Rock" cliff section, a small outcrop at Cape Willoughby and a thin remnant overlying the Cape Jervis Beds at Cape Jervis.|
24460|Point Ellen Formation|Thickness range|Variable, but up to 2 m.|
24460|Point Ellen Formation|Lithology|Richly fossiliferous limestone and coquinite composed predominantly of fossil gastropods.|
24460|Point Ellen Formation|Age reasons|Early Pleistocene.  On the ocean coastline of Point Ellen, just south of the car park, the bedrock Kanmantoo Group metasediments are overlain with marked unconformity by richly fossiliferous coquinite (Fig. 21). These sediments infill a highly irregular surface eroded in the bedrock, and clearly represent deposition in a restricted bay or inlet on a rocky coast. Abundant cobbles and boulders of bedrock metasediments occur within the fossiliferous sediments. In some places, there are beds crowded with gastropods including a new species of Nerita (Fig. 22). The section is of highly variable thickness to a maximum of 2 m because of the irregular topography of the bedrock unconformity, and is capped by a complex calcrete profile. Towards the eastern end of the outcrop, conspicuous large solution pipes extend through the calcrete capping and the fossiliferous sandstones, and bottom on bedrock at the unconformity. The rich molluscan fauna can be directly correlated with that of the Roe Calcarenite in the Eucla Basin described by Ludbrook (1978). Its most important constituent is the pelagic janthinid gastaropod Hartungia dennanti chavani which is conspicuous among the mass of Nerita shells in the cliff face. This molluscan fauna, so far unrecognised in South Australia, is reported in a separate paper (Ludbrook 1983) which includes a description of the new species of Nerita and a new lucinid. Specimens first collected from this locality in 1914 by Arthur Wade were identified by F. Chapman. Most of Wade's material is in the Palaeontological Collection of the Geological Survey of South Australia, but some was retained in the National Museum of Victoria, including the holotype of Glycymeris australia var. gigantea Chapman, which is a specimen of Anodontia sphericula (Basedow), common in both the Hallett Cove Sandstone and the Roe Calcarenite, and having a range of Middle Miocene to Early Pleistocene. Chapman correctly determined the fossils from Point Ellen as "equivalent to the Werrikooian of Victoria or Upper Pliocene". The Werrikoo Limestone in Victoria is now considered to straddle the Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary, the foraminifera indicating that only the lower part including the basal shell bed is of probable Late Pliocene age, the rest being Early Pleistocene (Singleton et al. 1976).|
24460|Point Ellen Formation|Correlations| Problems of making direct faunal correlation between the Point Ellen Formation and the Werrikoo Limestone are twofold: first, no modern descriptions or differentiated lists of Werrikooian molluscs from the Glenelg River sequence are published and, secondly, depositional environments were sufficiently different to be reflected in the assemblages. The western side of the Point Ellen outcrop was illustrated by Daily et al. (1979), who considered the presence of Anodontia to indicate a possible Pliocene age. This is not supported by the stratigraphical range of Anodontia sphericula. Other Roe Calcarenite species occurring in the Point Ellen Formation include Timoclea (Veremolpa) kendricki Monilea euclensis and Hartungia dennam chavani. Foraminifera are poorly represented but include Ammonia beccarii, Elphidium rotatum and Epistomaroides polystomelloides all of which are species still living.|23/APR/09

24622|Prospect Hill Granite|Name source|Adapted from Prospect Hill, 16.6km northwest of Mount Babbage at the northern end of the Flinders Ranges, Moolawatana 1:100 000 and Callabonna 1:250 000 map sheets. Initially used informally by Teale et al. (1989).|
24622|Prospect Hill Granite|Type section locality|West of Petermorra Springs and north of Prospect Hill trig point (Fig. 3).|
24622|Prospect Hill Granite|Extent|A narrow exposure at the northern end of the Prospect Hill area about 2.8 km long and only 100-200 m wide. It is the northernmost exposure of the Mount Babbage Inlier.|
24622|Prospect Hill Granite|Lithology|The dominant rock type consists of a distinctive porphyritic granitic rock, grey in colour with fine to medium-grained groundmass. Sparsely scattered throughout are anhedral to round off-white phenocrysts (10-15 mm) of microperthitic microcline. The groundmass consists of subequal amountsof orthoclase, plagioclase, bluish quartz and approximately 10% biotite. Accessory minerals include tourmaline, fluorite, monazite and allanite. The bulk mineralogy is consistent with an adamellite. Wispy biotite-rich xenoliths are common in some zones at the eastern end of the outcrop within a more equigranular variety of the adamellite. Characteristic of the Prospect Hill Granite are clots of tourmaline (30-100 mm across) which are concentrated along the southern contact with the Petermorra Volcanics. Boron is anomalously high with values ranging from 90-550 ppm. Post emplacement deformation has imparted a weak foliation with a subvertical dip and strike of ~85o-95o magnetic.|
24622|Prospect Hill Granite|Relationships and boundaries|A broadly concordant but intrusive southern contact with Petermorra Volcanics. Adjacent volcaniclastic sandstone (including the unnamed sericitic sandstone member of Petermorra Volcanics) near the contact contains abundant clots and aggregates with tourmaline and quartz, formed by fluids which emanated from the Prospect Hill Granite.|
24622|Prospect Hill Granite|Age reasons|High-level plutons of the Prospect Hill Granite and White Well Granite intrude the sequence. Neither has been dated, but are assumed to be of similar age to other, deeper-level granitoids in the region that have statistically identical U-Pb zircon ages of 1556+/-4, 1556+/-10 and 1557+/-6 Ma.|
24622|Prospect Hill Granite|Correlations|A similar porphyritic adamellite occurs as pods and narrow lenticular bodies within the Terrapinna Granite south of White Well Bore. No other direct correlative is known.|

26322|Relief Sandstone|Type section locality|Meramangye-1 (Latitude 28o22'10"S, Longitude 132o16'28"E) 357.6 to 447.2 m.|
26322|Relief Sandstone|Extent|The Relief Sandstone is not known to crop out, but has been intersected in numerous drillholes in the Emu and Marla-Manya areas (Fig. 7). It may also occur at the bottom of Wilkinson-1 below the Ouldburra Formation.|
26322|Relief Sandstone|Thickness range|In the type section the Relief Sandstone is approximately 90 m thick, it is 117 m at Giles-1 while in the Marla-Manya area it exceeds 300 m. Figure 7 shows the distribution of thickness in drillhole intersections.|
26322|Relief Sandstone|Lithology|The Relief Sandstone is a mottled medium to pale brown moderately well consolidated silica cemented, very fine to very coarse grained sandstone. In the type section and other nearby drillholes the lower portion is medium to fine grained, moderately to poorly sorted with subrounded to rounded terrigenous and metamorphic quartz clastic grains. The cement is commonly siliceous but minor calcite, dolomite, and gypsum occur locally and iron staining is evident in part. Small and medium scale cross-bedding is present. The upper unit contains numerous pale to olive-grey siltstone and minor claystone interbeds up to, and occasionally exceeding, half a metre thick. In the Marla-Manya area the sandstone ranges from pale red to olive-grey and medium brown. The formation top is characterised by planar laminae delineated by very fine to very coarse variations of grainsize. Sorting is moderate to poor; anhydrite nodules, and fragments and patches of sulphate  evaporite cement are rare. Small and medium-scale cross-bedding is common. The composition of the lower portion of the formation reflects proximity to the underlying rock units with an overall increase in grainsize and abundance of pebble to cobble sized gneiss clasts.|
26322|Relief Sandstone|Depositional environment|There is no unequivocal evidence for the environment of deposition. The lower portion of the formation (up to 80 m thick) in the Emu area is moderately to locally well-=sorted with small to medium low-angle cross bedding and carbonate and evaporite cement in parts. This widespread unit of monotonous clean sandstone is thought to be a marine deposit. The basal few metres of the type section, and at Observatory Hill-1, appear to be reworked. This possibly suggests deposition and subsequent reworking during transgression. Alternating siltstone and sandstone in the upper portion of the type section and in Giles-1 suggest a possible fluvial environment, and may indicate local regression. In the Marla-Manya area the relationship between the Relief Sandstone and the overlying Ouldburra Formation indicates that the upper portion of the Relief Sandstone was deposited in shallow marine conditions.|
26322|Relief Sandstone|Relationships and boundaries|In the Emu area the Relief Sandstone disconformably overlies the Rodda beds. In the Marla-Manya area however the unit unconformably overlies either ?Adelaidean volcanics, crystalline basement, or rests disconformably on older sediments.|
26322|Relief Sandstone|Age reasons|The Relief Sandstone is stratigraphically older than the Early Cambrian Ouldburra Formation and younger than the ?Adelaidean Rodda beds.|

24484|Saint Francis Granite|Name source|St Francis Is, Nuyts Archipelago, located ~55 km SW of Ceduna.|
24484|Saint Francis Granite|Type section locality|Reference sections: Outcrops containing representative lithologies occur widely on eastern St Francis Is, western West Is and at Point Peter.|
24484|Saint Francis Granite|Extent|Isolated exposures on St Francis, West, Masillon, Fenelon, Smooth and Egg Islands, plus Point Peter and Cape Beaufort.|
24484|Saint Francis Granite|Lithology|Three similar leucogranite to leucoporphyry varieties occur. Exposed on eastern St Francis, Fenelon, Masillon, Smooth and Egg Islands is a distinctive grey granite which varies from equigranular, medium-grained to porphyritic with both K-feldspar and quartz phenocrysts. The mafic content is low (<2%) and is chiefly aegerine-augite, hornblende and magnetite. Graphic intergrowths of quartz and K-feldspar form >90% of the rock. White to pale grey leucogranite, exposed on West Is, and intruding Nuyts Volcanics on St Francis Is, also have low mafic content. Amphibole, sphene and magnetite are the main mafic constituents. The felsic component varies greatly in nature from coarse-grained fragments of perthitic K-feldspar to a recrystallised granular mosaic of quartz and feldspar within microshear bands. White leucoporphyry at Point Peter has similar lithological characteristics being very felsic and containing only very minor quantities of biotite and magnetite. Microcline and quartz are the dominent constituents, with the perthitic microcline forming coarse crystals, partly corroded, in a graphic quartz and K-feldspar matrix.|
24484|Saint Francis Granite|Relationships and boundaries|3 suites of felsic volcanic dykes and dolerite dykes intrude the grey granite on St Francis Is. The felsic dykes are correlated with the Nuyts Volcanics. Leucogranite intrudes and truncates dykes of pink rhyolite (Pa3-Nuyts Volcanics) which are within mylonitic augen gneiss on West Is, and leucogranite also form a small intrusive plug within the Nuyts Volcanics on western St Francis Is. These relationships suggest more than one phase of plutonism.|
24484|Saint Francis Granite|Age reasons|Rb-Sr geochronology summarised in Webb et al (1986), 8 samples of grey granite from St Francis Is have high Rb/Sr ratios, and regression of 6 samples produced an isochron of 1478+/-15 Ma, IR = 0.70114+/-0.0032. A similar result was obtained for the leucogranite from West Is's regression of 4 samples gave an age of 1466+/-79 Ma, IR = 0.7142+/0.0196. Similar ages in the range 1470-1490 Ma were obtained for the Nuyts Volcanics, but are significantly younger than ages derived from U-Pb studies. Extrusive age of Nuyts Volcanics are 1631+/-3 Ma for St Francis Is, and 1627+/-2 Ma for St Peter Is. Rb-Sr ages are considered unreliable; field relationships infer intrusion of St Francis Granite is broadly synchronous with the Nuyts Volcanics.|
24484|Saint Francis Granite|Correlations|Stratigraphic correlations: U-Pb isotopic ages for Nuyts Volcanics indicate the Nuyts Volcanics and St Francis Granite are older than, and not related to, the Gawler Range Volcanics and Hiltaba Suite granite. St Francis Granite and Nuyts Volcanics represent a discrete phase of felsic magmatism during the latter part of the Palaeoproterozoic. Correlatives of the St Francis Granite are not known elsewhere in South Australia.|

24491|Second Plain Creek Member|Name source|Named after Second Plain Creek, near Wilkawillina Gorge, The Bunkers 1:50 000 Topographic Map, GR 930930.|
24491|Second Plain Creek Member|Type section locality|The type section of the member is composed of 73.5 m of predominantly grey limestone exposed in an east-west running creek and on adjacent ridges at GR 986378 (the Bunkers topographic map sheet). This section is 760 m south of the type section of the Wilkawillina Limestone (Daily 1956) and the reference section of the Hawker Group (Dalgarno, 1964). The new member does outcrop in the above type/reference sections, but the new locality was chosen as the type section of the new member because in this locality the unit is both thicker and better developed.|
24491|Second Plain Creek Member|Extent|The unit occurs discontinuously along the eastern margin of the Flinders Ranges, particularly in the Bunkers Range. The member is best developed near Wilkawillina Gorge within the Bunkers Graben.|
24491|Second Plain Creek Member|Thickness range|Where measured the unit reaches a maximum thickness of 76 m. There is no reason to suspect that this is the minimum thickness of the unit. It is thickest in the centre of the Bunkers Graben, and thins markedly towards the margins of the structure, where it is at times absent.|
24491|Second Plain Creek Member|Lithology|The unit is lithologically variable and includes lime mudstones, wackestones, packstones and grainstones, with intraclastic rudstones and floatstones. In the type section the member passes from a sparry red nodular limestone at the base into mottled limes, mudstones and wackestones which grade upward into interbedded wackestones, packstones and grainstones. The top of the sequence is often marked by intraclastic rudstones and floatstones. Fossils are common in the unit but are normally preserved as fragments.|
24491|Second Plain Creek Member|Relationships and boundaries|The member disconformably overlies the Winnitinny Creek Member of the Wilkawillina Limestone (Clarke 1986a) along a karstic and locally calcreted surface. The member can be distinguished from the underlying unit by its darker colour and more micritic composition. The base of the Second Plain Creek Member locally contains clasts and pisoliths reworked from the underlying unit and its calcrete cap. The disconformity surface is irregular on a scale range from millimetres to tens of metres. The unit is conformably overlain by the Six Mile Bore Member of the Parara Limestone (Clarke 1986b). The member can be distinguished from the Parara Limestone by the Parara Limestone's much darker colour (grey to black when fresh), brown to yellow colour on weathered surfaces and abundant shale interbeds. The Parara Limestone is also nodular to flaggy in outcrop, while the Second Plain Creek Member tends well bedded to massive.|
24491|Second Plain Creek Member|Age reasons|The underlying Winnitinny Creek Member contains Faunal Assemblage (FA) 2 of Daily (1956) while the Six ;Mile Bore Member of the Parara Limestone (overlying the Second Plain Creek Member) contains FA 3. The type section for the new member lies in the upper part of Gravestock's (1984) Section 'I' from which a new assemblage (as yet undesribed) was found to  contain archaeocyaths, Lapworthellids and brachipods. Gravestock (1984) correlated FA2 with the Early Cambarian Kameshky Horizon of the Altai-Sayan region of the USSR. The truncation of the top of FA in the Wilkawillina Gorge region makes determination of its duration difficult, but the absence of the subaerial disconformity at the top of FA 2 in the Mt Scott Range area, and its replacement by a rapid faunal turnover between FA 2 and 3 therefore suggests that this hiatus was of relatively brief biostratigraphic duration.|

26161|Tandanya Sand Member|Name source|'Tandanya' is the aboriginal place name for the 'site of Adelaide south of the Torrens' (Black, 1920, p.84). This corresponds closely with the known distribution of the sand. The name has been approved by the Central Register of Stratigraphic Nomenclature, Canberra.|
26161|Tandanya Sand Member|Type section locality|The type section is at a depth of 39.9-43.o m (131-141 feet) in foundation test bore 4. State Administration Building, eastern siute of Victoria Square, central City of Adelaide (Lindsay, 1964); Selby and Lindsay, 1973),Borehole Unit No. 662841 MEW00276, Town Acre 270, hundred Adelaide. Tube-core samples are stored in the Departmental Core Library at Glenside. |
26161|Tandanya Sand Member|Extent|The Member is known only subsurface from more than 30 boreholes in the Adelaide City area south of the River Torrens, including the East, South, and West Parklands (Fig. 1). It has apparently been removed by erosion north of the Torrens. The sand was probably penetrated by a water bore in the Collegiate School of St Peter, Hackney, a little to the east of the city area and by boreholes in the Mile End Block west of the city. All localities are in the Adelaide Plains Sub-basin of the St Vincent Basin.|
26161|Tandanya Sand Member|Thickness range|The thickness varies between 1.3 and at least 5.3 m. The type section is 3.1 m.|
26161|Tandanya Sand Member|Lithology|The unit is a quartz sand, which is glauconitic (ovoid pellets common), pyritic and carbonaceous. It varies from poorly-sorted, pebbly, muddy, to clean medium-coarse sand, to soft silty fine sand. The colour is generally dark to pale grey and brownish, but yellowish-grey where oxidised. Animal fossils include sparse and sporadic foraminifera (including a few planktonic forms), sponge spicules (mostly pyritised), fragments and minute internal casts of molluscs, occasional bryozoal and echinoid fragments. Plant fossils include spores, pollen and organic-walled micro-plankton. Pyritised tube-casts (?burrows) also occur.|
26161|Tandanya Sand Member|Relationships and boundaries|The sand grades upwards into laminated fine sand and soft mudstone, overlain by mudstone and silt. This interval, 5.5 to 7.5 m thick, between the Tandanya Sand Member and the basal Aldinga Member of Port Willunga Formation, is identified as undifferentiated Chinaman Gully Formation. The Tandanya Sand is stratigraphically distinct from the basal sand of the Aldinga Member. Beneath the Tandanya Sand, the chert-banded Gull Rock Member of Blanche Point Formation is separated from the sand either by a sharp disconformity, or by a metre or so of laminated clayey silt (predominant) and very fine sand, also regarded as undifferentiated Chinaman Gully Formation. Upper Blanche Point Formation ('Soft Marls') appears to be not present in the City area. The upper and lower boundaries of the Tandanya Sand Member are defined by the predominance of sand-sized grains over other constituents.|
26161|Tandanya Sand Member|Identifying features|This Note names and describes the sand which occurs beneath the City of Adelaide, in the St Vincent Basin, near the base of beds correlated lithologically and palynologically with Chinaman Gully Formation (Reynolds, 1953; Cooper, 1977). The sand unit was distinguished  (JML) as a marker bed in 'equivalents of Blanche Point Soft Marl' or upper Blanche Point Formation, in geological cross-sections through the City area (in Selby and Lindsay, 1975, 1978).|
26161|Tandanya Sand Member|Structure and Metamorphism|Structural contours of the top of the Tandanya Sand Member have been constructed from intersections in 34 boreholes (Fig. 1). The contours show that, like the other mid-Tertiary formations, the surface dips evenly at little more than 1o towards the south to southeast.|
26161|Tandanya Sand Member|Correlations|The member is stratigraphically below the Aldinga Member of Port Willunga Formation and above the lower units of Blanche Point Formation. Since all these are well dated Late Eocene, the Tandanya Sand Member is also Late Eocene, probably Zone P. 16. Lithological units interposed between Gull Rock member and Aldinga Member in the Adelaide Plains Sub-basin (Lindsay, 1968; 1969, p.34) were identified broadly as ' Blanche Point Soft Marls Member' of Reynolds (1953) and included 'in its upper part...time-equivalents of Chinaman's Gully Beds'. Recent evidence from dinoflagellate assemblages (WKH) indicates a more precise correlation of at least part of this interval with Chinaman Gully Formation, now recognised as a very widespread unit in the St Vincent Basin, thickening northwards. Beyond Adelaide, the basal unit of the Chinaman Gully Formation (correlative of the Tandanya Sand Member in the Adelaide City area) is strongly progradational, very marginal-marine, and may be a lignite. In terms of palynological zones, the unit lies within the spore/pollen zone of Sparganiaceaepollenites barungensis. Similar assemblages have been recorded from the Chinaman Gully Formation in the Willunga Embayment.|

27953|Warcowie Dolomite Member|Name source|After 'Warcowie' H.S., situated 25 km northeast of Hawker.  Map Symbol: Puw.|
27953|Warcowie Dolomite Member|Type section locality|Although easily accessible and well-exposed sections of the Warcowie Dolomite Member are common, its base is mostly a tectonic contact with carbonate breccia. Only on the east limb of the Worumba Anticline is a sedimentary base (disconformaity to unconformity) preserved, and a less accessible type section is therefore chosen in this area, on a western spur of Mount Plantagenet, commencing at 279470-6470800 and finishing at 279630-6470750. Other good sections may be examined along Maraby Creek, Waraco Creek, and along the road 1.5 km west of 'Worumba' H.S.|
27953|Warcowie Dolomite Member|Extent|The Member occurs at base of Wilyerpa Formation on both limbs of the Worumba Anticline, except where it laps out. Forbes (1970) recorded similar yellow-brown pebbly dolomite at the base of the Wilyerpa Formation in the Benda Range, Olary region.|
27953|Warcowie Dolomite Member|Thickness range|In type section, 80 m, but elsewhere thinner (10-20 m). The Member laps out against a syndepositional high (a small block of Wirreanda Dolomite Beds) 3 km SSW of 'Worumba'.|
27953|Warcowie Dolomite Member|Lithology|Lithological Sequence in Type Section: Top: 35 m conglomerate, massive, partly matrix supported, with poorly outcropping silty and sandy matrix. Clasts mostly well rounded, pebble to boulder size, including granites, pale grey and red quartzites. Elsewhere include also schist, gneiss, dolomite, chert, and altered dolerite. 20 m dolomite, pale grey to buff, pale brown weathering, massive, poorly bedded. Elsewhere contains scattered pebbles.  20 m dolomite, buff, brown weathering, sandy and gritty, well bedded. Base 5 m breccia, with dolomitic matrix, including angular fragments of micaceous siltstone and sandstone, derived from nearby unconformably underlying disrupted Niggle Gp Beds.|
27953|Warcowie Dolomite Member|Relationships and boundaries|Overlies Holowilena Ironstone with low-angle unconformity in the type section, and overlaps eastwards on to disrupted Niggly Gap Beds. Elsewhere, base of the Member commonly tectonic contact with carbonate breccias, in part intrusive into the Member and overlying Sturtian formations. Upper boundary is a well defined by conformable contact with olive green siltstones and sandstones (upper part of the Wilyerpa Formation). |
27953|Warcowie Dolomite Member|Identifying features|Distinctive basal dolomitic and conglomeratic sequence of the Wilyerpa Formation, Umberatana Group.|
27953|Warcowie Dolomite Member|Structure and Metamorphism|The Member, together with remainder of Umberatana Group, outlines the structure of the Worumba Anticline, with a gently dipping east limb and steeply dipping to overturned west limb. Wilyerpa Formation is cut by  north west-trending cross faults, many of which were active during deposition.|
27953|Warcowie Dolomite Member|Age reasons|The age is mid-Sturtian.|

29118|Warragee Member|Type section locality|350 metres of red and green shale, with minor calcareous and tuffaceous intervals, exposed over an area of undulatory topography 2.5 km north of Ten Mile Creek, from Latitude 31015'50"S, Longitude 138o49'24"E (bottom) to Latitude 31o15'47"S, Longitude 138o49'43"E (top).|
29118|Warragee Member|Extent|The unit is exposed over approximately 35 km2 in the central Flinders Ranges (along the Heysen Range, at Mernmerna, between Wirrealpa and the Ten Mile Creek, near Mount Frome and adjacent to Chambers Gorge), on the Parachilna 1:250 000 Geological Sheet (SH54-13). It also outcrops over approximately 10 km2 in the Mount Scott Range, on the western portion of the Copley 1:250 000 Geological Sheet (SH54-9).|
29118|Warragee Member|Thickness range|Range 0-360 m|
29118|Warragee Member|Lithology|Red, green and grey shales and fine to medium siltstones. Minor interbeds of dolomite, dolomitic limestone, tuff and coarse siltstone. Generally evenly laminated. Minor ripple lamination.|
29118|Warragee Member|Relationships and boundaries|Basal member of the Billy Creek Formation in central Flinders Ranges and at Mount Scott. Conformably overlies the Oraparinna Shale (Daily, 1956) where the latter unit is present. Rests conformably on the Wilkawillina Limestone east of the Wirrealpa Diapir. Rests sharply and probably disconformably on the Wilkawillina Limestone south of the Ten Mile Creek graben and near Mount Frome. Rests conformably on the Ajax Limestone in the Mount Scott Range (Moore, in press) and rests conformably on the Moorowie Formation south of the Chambers Gorge (Mount, 1970). Base of the unit is defined by red and minor green shales. Conformably overlain by the Nildottie Siltstone Member of the Billy Creek Formation.|
29118|Warragee Member|Age reasons|The Warragee Member is underlain by the Oraparinna Shale and its equivalents, which are of middle Lower Cambrian age (Walter, 1967). It is overlain by up to 550 metres of unfossiliferous red-beds of the Billy Creek Formation, which are in turn overlain by the early Middle Cambrian Wirrealpa Limestone (Daily, 1956). The Warragee Member is therefore probably entirely late Lower Cambrian in age.|

26205|Waurea Pyroclastics|Name source|From Waurea hill on Moonarie station, adjacent to Lake Everard station. Waurea hill is located at 31o52' latitude and 135o26' longitude, within mapped area. Origin: The lateral continuity and uniformity and petrographic features of this unit indicates that it is a poorly welded to unwelded ashflow deposit. The tuff breccias, containing blocks up to 1 m across cannot be far from the original vent.|
26205|Waurea Pyroclastics|Type section locality|Due to the isolated nature of outcrops and variability of this unit it is not possible to propose a type section. However, typical Waurea Pyroclastics may be seen 1.2 km due east of Glyde Hill outstation, which is located at latitude 31o37' and longitude 135o09.5'.|
26205|Waurea Pyroclastics|Extent|Occurs as isolated outcrops extending from the southwest of the Gairdner 1:250 000 Sheet area onto the southeast of the Childara 1:250 000 Sheet area. Total outcrop area would not exceed 7 km2.|
26205|Waurea Pyroclastics|Lithology|Invariably a white to buff coloured lapilli-tuff to tuff breccia of ashflow origin. Usually poorly welded, it weathers to a white, shaky-looking rock. The lapilli and blocks are composed of a variety of volcanic rock types, the most common being a strongly flow banded rhyolite and a fine grained, dense, strongly welded ashflow tuff. There is a complete lack of sorting and bedding among the lapilli and block size fragments. In the lapilli-tuffs, the lapilli size pumice and lithic fragments sit in a matrix of ash size fragments and undeformed glass shards (devit.). In the tuff breccias, the blocks of volcanic rock fragments are within a completely unsorted matrix of lapilli and ash size fragments. The tuff breccias are far less common than the lapilli tuffs and are localised in only two areas.|
26205|Waurea Pyroclastics|Relationships and boundaries|The Waurea Pyroclastics conformably overly the Baldry Rhyolite and conformably underly the Wheepool Rhyolite (defined by Blissett). Thickness is variable, ranging from 3 m to 20 m. The thickness is unlikely to exceed 40 m.|

24632|White Well Granite|Name source|Adapted from White Well Bore, 3 km south of Prospect Hill trig and 15 km northwest of Mount Babbage at the northern end of the Flinders Ranges, Moolawatana 1:100 000 and Callabonna 1:250 000 map sheets. This name was first used informally by Teale et al. (1989).|
24632|White Well Granite|Type section locality|North of White Well Bore between the old Dog Proof Fence and the new electric Dog Proof Fence, with exposures of two medium-sized and one small stock occurring on a south-facing ridge flank.|
24632|White Well Granite|Extent|Limited to an outcrop area of 2.2 x 1.3 km south of Prospect Hill and north of White Well bore.|
24632|White Well Granite|Lithology|The dominant rock type consists of deformed, medium-grained biotite granite. Composition is essentially microcline, quartz, plagioclase, biotite and secondary muscovite. Accessory minerals include zircon, monazite and apatite. The rock has aligned K-feldspar and plagioclase prismatic phenocrysts and bluish to translucent grey quartz, and decussate biotite aggregates. The granitoid stocks are compositionally zoned; adamellite cores contain mostly grey quartz whereas the outer granitic zones contain bluish quartz. Xenoliths occur within the granite contact margins. Post-emplacement deformation has imposed a mica foliation, similar to that of the surrounding Petermorra Volcanics (i.e. trend of ~85o-95o magnetic and subvertical).|
24632|White Well Granite|Relationships and boundaries|Three ovoid stocks of this granitoid intrude Petermorra Volcanics. Dimensions of these stocks are 400 x 1200 m. Most contacts with the host Petermorra Volcanics are intrusive, the granite also forming apophyses and dykes. Faulted contacts also occur, mostly on the southwest margins of each stock. The southern most stock is in fault contact with the Terrapinna Granite.|
24632|White Well Granite|Age reasons|High-level plutons of the Prospect Hill Granite and White Well Granite intrude the sequence. Neither has been dated, but are assumed to be of similar age to other, deeper-level granitoids in the region that have statistically identical U-Pb zircon ages of 1556+/-4, 1556+/-10 and 1557+/-6 Ma.|

19949|Whyeela Dacite|Name source|From Whyeela dam on Lake Everard station. Whyeela dam is near extensive outcrops of Whyeela Dacite and is located at 31o38' latitude and 135o14.5' longitude. Origin:  A strongly welded crystal-vitric ashflow tuff. Devitrification has obscured primary texture. The more basic variants probably represent different ashflows within the composite sheet.|
19949|Whyeela Dacite|Type section locality|Top of unit is not seen, however a good basal section may be seen adjacent to the Lake Everard station - Kokatha station track at 31o41' latitude and 135o15.25' longitude.|

19949|Whyeela Dacite|Thickness range|At least 100 m.|
19949|Whyeela Dacite|Lithology|A red-brown porphyry containing medium grained phenocrysts of alkali feldspar, plagioclase sitting in an aphanitic groundmass. Dark green, more basic variants occur, these containing visible phenocrysts of clinopyroxene, sometimes altered to chlorite. In thin section, medium grained euhedral phenocrysts of alkali feldspar, plagioclase and fine grained phenocrysts of clinopyroxene (augite) are scattered through a devitrified, microlitic textured groundmass. Fine grained phenocrysts of plagioclase are present, commonly occurring as glomoroporphyritic aggregates. Odd fine grained, euhedral phenocrysts of orthopyroxene (hypersthene) are scattered throughout but are far less common than augite phenocrysts. Limonite stains the groundmass red giving the rock its characteristic red-brown colour. In the rocks containing a higher percentage of pyroxene, chlorite and magnetite are scattered throughout the groundmass, giving the rock a dark green colouration. Minute fractured, crustal chips are common. Phenocrysts make up roughly 15% of the rock, with plagioclase, alkali feldspar and augite predominating.|
19949|Whyeela Dacite|Relationships and boundaries|Overlies the Yantea Rhyodacite and is separated from this unit in places by a thin (>2 m thick) ashflow tuff. Top of this unit is not seen as it is the youngest volcanic unit exposed in the Glyde Hill Complex (Blissett).  |
19949|Whyeela Dacite|Age reasons|Forms part of the Glyde Hill Complex as defined by Blissett. Age mid-Carpentarian, roughly 1550 Ma. Is the youngest volcanic unit in the Glyde Hill Complex.|

(see Comments for further section)|23/APR/09
24580|Wirreanda Dolomite Beds|Extent|The Beds occur over a continuous strike length of 11 km in the eastern part of the core complex of the Worumba Anticline, and in several isolated blocks in carbonate breccia to the north and south.|
24580|Wirreanda Dolomite Beds|Thickness range|About 1300 m exposed in the type section.|
24580|Wirreanda Dolomite Beds|Relationships and boundaries|Nowhere seen in conformable sedimentary contact with other sequences. Type section bounded to west by intrusive carbonate breccia, elsewhere in fault contact with Niggly Gap Beds. Eastern boundary either with intrusive carbonate breccia, or (as in the case of the type section) disconformity with overlying Sturtian formations (Holowilena Ironstone, and elsewhere, Wilyerpa Formation). In places there is strong angular unconformity beneath the Wilyerpa Formation, e.g. 3 km SSW of 'Worumba' H.S.|
24580|Wirreanda Dolomite Beds|Identifying features|Definition: A sequence of thinly bedded dark grey dolomite, weathering blue-grey to brown, with minor interbedded siltstone, dolomitic sandstone, magnesite conglomerate and black chert, occurring in the eastern part of the Worumba Anticline core complex. The general facies resembles that of known Burra Group carbonates.|
24580|Wirreanda Dolomite Beds|Structure and Metamorphism|Beds mostly steeply east dipping, though at northern extremity, tend to be overturned. In the type section, the outcrop width is increased by open folding, with upright axial planes and gently plunging, mainly meridional axes.|
24580|Wirreanda Dolomite Beds|Age reasons|The Wirreanda Dolomite Beds closely resemble known Burra Group carbonates, in particular the Skillogalee Dolomite and the Blyth Dolomite. They are distinguished in the Worumba area from the Skillogalee Dolomite by the absence of columnar stromatolites, a lower magnesite content, and the abundance of tepee structures. As outcrops of the two units are in places only a kilometre apart, stratigraphic equivalence would require lateral facies changes more rapid than is characteristic of the Skillogalee Dolomite elsewhere. In the vicinity of the Wirreanda Creek (Yednalue 1:50 000 sheet area) probable equivalents of the Wirreanda Dolomite Beds have been mapped as part of the River Wakefield Subgroup, overlain conformably by siltstones of the River Wakefield Subgroup, followed by Yednalue Quartzite (Binks, 1968). Such a stratigraphic position is tentatively accepted, and the Wirreanda Dolomite Beds are included in the River Wakefield Subgroup of the Burra Group. Nevertheless, a relatively abrupt facies change (within about 20 km) is required between the Worumba and Yednalue Anticlines; in the latter, the carbonates of the River Wakefield Subgroup contain stromatolites and abundant magnesite conglomerate, and are difficult to distinguish lithologically from the Skillogalee Dolomite.  The age is inferred to be early Torrensian.|

24591|Yadlamalka Formation|Lithology|Dark grey laminated dolomicrites with occasional dessication cracks and black nodular chert; dark grey domal and columnar stromatolitic dolomite with black nodular chert; intraformational magnesite conglomerates; and grey dolomitic sandstones. Minor laminated micritic magnesite, intraformational dolomite conglomerates, oolitic dolomite, oncolitic dolomite and siltstone.|
24591|Yadlamalka Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Underlain conformably by the Nathaltee Formation (new name to be proposed in same publication), Yednalue Quartzite (Spry, 1952) or Bungaree Quartzite (Forbes, 1977) in the northern Mt Lofty and Southern Flinders Ranges, and by the Nankabunyana Formation (new name to be proposed in same publication) in the Northern Flinders Ranges. Overlain conformably by the Undalya Quartzite in northern Mt Lofty and Southern Flinders Ranges, and by the Myrtle Springs Formation (Coats, 1973) in the northern Flinders Ranges.|

20817|Yandoolka Rhyolite|Type section locality|Hill on east side of road to Hiltaba, 1.5 km south of Lake Everard H.S.|
20817|Yandoolka Rhyolite|Extent|Low scattered outcrops extend over 20 km2, 2 km southeast of Yandoolka Well, and over an isolated area of about 5 km2, 1.5 km southeast of Lake Everard H.S.|
20817|Yandoolka Rhyolite|Lithology|Highly porphyritic rhyolite or porphyritic microgranite with many phenocrysts of potash feldspar and quartz up to 5 mm long, in a reddish brown finely granular matrix. Accessory biotite and amphibolite has been altered to chlorite and epidote. The rock contains microphenocrysts of sphene. If extrusive the rhyolite must have been a crystal rich lava. It may have been intruded as a plug of crystal rich magma which cooled rapidly after emplacement.|
20817|Yandoolka Rhyolite|Relationships and boundaries|The base is not exposed, and boundaries are obscured by Quaternary deposits. The unit apparently lies below the porphyritic rhyodacite and dacite units -Pag2 and -Pag3. However, it may be an intrusive neck or plug related to the system of vents from which the volcanic breccia and agglomerate in the lower part of the Wheepool Rhyolite was ejected.|
20817|Yandoolka Rhyolite|Comments|Outcrops tend to form low yellowish brown weathered rounded masses and tors, similar to granite.|

26241|Yantea Rhyodacite|Name source|From Yantea Well on Moonarie station, which adjoins Lake Everard station on the Gairdner 1:250 000 Sheet area. Yantea well is locataed at 31o50' latitude and 135o30.25' longitude. Origin: A strongly welded crystal-vitric ashflow tuff. A composite sheet consisting of at least three simple cooling units. Welding is not so strong in the zones between the simple cooling units.|
26241|Yantea Rhyodacite|Type section locality|Is not possible to define a type section including the base and top of this unit, but the type example of this unit occurs on Everard Hill (formerly Black Hill) which is located at latitude 31o40' and longitude 135o08'.|
26241|Yantea Rhyodacite|Extent|The most extensive unit in the Glyde Hill Complex (Blissett), occupying a large area in the central west of the Gairdner 1:250 000 sheet area and extending onto the central eastern portion of the Childara 1:250 000 sheet area.|
26241|Yantea Rhyodacite|Lithology|A distinctive brick red coloured rock both in hand specimen and weathered outcrop. Medium to coarse grained plagioclase and alkali feldspar phenocrysts and green patches of chlorite replacing ferromagnesian minerals are scattered through a microcrystalline groundmass. This unit is composite and is made up of at least three and possibly more, simple cooling units. These simple cooling units are almost identical in hand specimen and therefore it is not practicable to separate them into individual mappable units. The simple cooling units are separated from each other by narrow zones (usually <4 m thick) of fine grained crystal tuff which are poorly welded and in which devitrification has not obscured the outlines of the relatively undeformed shards. Commonly these zones are highly vesicular with vapour phase chlorite, epidote and quartz filling the vesicles. Zones of flow brecciation at the base of the simple cooling units are also often seen. In thin section the Yantea Rhyodacite consists of euhedral phenocrysts of simply twinned alkali feldspar, plus altered plagioclase as isolated crystals and glomeroporphyritic aggregates sitting in a completely devitrified groundmass. The groundmass shows variable devitrification textures ranging from granophyric to patch to microgranular. Always the groundmass devitrification textures are relatively coarse, suggesting slow cooling within the thick ashflow sheets. Limonite is scattered throughout the groundmass, imparting the characteristic red colouration of the rock. Medium to coarse plagioclase phenocrysts are dominant. Fresh clinopyroxene is rarely seen, most being altered to green chlorite, which still retains the euhedral outlines of the original clinopyroxene. Phenocrysts make up a total of about 15-20% of the rock.|
26241|Yantea Rhyodacite|Relationships and boundaries|This unit is overlain by the Whyeela Dacite and a minor unnamed rhyolite in the south. The Yantea Rhyodacite in turn disconformably overlies a number of older units. A significant period of erosion must have preceded the outpouring of the Yantea Rhyodacite as this unit is seen to overlie the Bunburn Dacite, Arburee Rhyolite, Wheepool Rhyolite, Waurea Pyroclastics, Baldry Rhyolite and Mordinyabee Rhyodacite at various places in the mapped area. Further evidence comes from the occurrence of tongues of Yantea Rhyodacite sitting in troughs or erosional lows within the Arburee Rhyolite and Wheepool Rhyolite. At this same stratigraphic level, the only outcrops of volcaniclastics in the Glyde Hill complex were noted - indicative of erosion. Thickness variable, but would reach at least 150 m in places.|
26241|Yantea Rhyodacite|Age reasons|Forms part of the Glyde Hill Complex as defined by Blissett. Age is mid-Carpentarian or roughly 1550 Ma upon geochronological evidence.|

26243|Yarle Sandstone|Name source|Yarle Lakes ison the northern margin of the Nullarbor Plain, between Watson and Maralinga (Fig. 1).|07/FEB/11
26243|Yarle Sandstone|Unit history|The previously published names for conceptually equivalent rocks on the northwestern and northern part of the platform, the Colville Sandstone (Lowry, 1970) and Plumridge Beds (Lowry et al, 1972; Jackson and van de Graaff, 1981) are not used (Benbow, in prep.).  Examination of the type and reference sections of the former unit indicate that the limestone is best included within the Nullarbor Limestone and that the bulk (at least) of the terrigenous sediments are likely to be Cretaceous, if not Permian, in age.  At one of the reference sections, basal and capping limestone units were described as being separated by about 20m of shale, sandstone and conglomerate, however it appears that there is only one limestone unit.  An unconformable relationship can be demonstrated between it and the underlying sandstone.  There is a transgressive lag beneath this limestone, not described by Lowry (1970), as occurs around the east margin of the Eucla Platform. The term Plumridge Beds is not used since a relationship with Nullarbor Limestone cannot be demonstrated and the lithological variation of this unit is much greater that that known for the Yarle Sandstone.  Furthermore, estimated thicknesses of 20-100m (Playford et al, 1975; Jackson and van de Graaff, 1981) far exceed that known for the Yarle Sandstone.|07/FEB/11
26243|Yarle Sandstone|Type section locality|This is located at Yarle Lakes; a type section has not been chosen because of minimal section exposure and uncertainty of recognition in drillholes that are commonly inadequately sampled.|
26243|Yarle Sandstone|Extent|The Yarle Sandstone occurs along the northeast margin of the Nullarbor Plain, between Yarle Lakes and Seven Miles Swamps, adjacent to the Ooldea Range (Fig. 1; Benbow and Lindsay, 1988). It apparently formsa narrow belt, generally less than 10km wide, along the inner margin of the Miocene platform,  at the limit of the Nullarbor Limestone.  There are exposures, now silicified and ferruginised, in the floors and around margins of the playa lakes, and also along the adjacent interdune corridors on the margin of the Great Victoria Desert between Yarle Lakes and Ooldea.|
26243|Yarle Sandstone|Thickness range|Up to 5m of section is exposed, but generally less than 2m is evident. maximum thickness could be about 20m, if the sand, intersected in the nearby Maralinga 14 to 17 wells is assigned to the formation (Benbow, 1990, Fig. 7).|
26243|Yarle Sandstone|Lithology|The formation is composed predominantly of quartz-rich sand, with a local bioclastic component that includes abraded fragments of foraminifers, echinoids, algae and molluscs. In the Yarle Lakes -Ooldea area the sand is mostly very fine and medium-grained. the finer sand is commonly bimodal, with a sunsidiary mode of coarse to very coarse-grained, well rounded quartz. Here there are also rare deformed, irregularly shaped clasts of yellow-brown limestone similar to those which make up the Nullarbor limestone.  Minor terrigenous mud also occurs. At Yarle Lakes there is cross0bedding that dips shorewards to the northeast; this is partly destroyed by bioturbation.|
26243|Yarle Sandstone|Relationships and boundaries|The formation unconformably overlies weathered Precambrian basement of the gawler Craton and sedimentary rocks of the Neoproterozoic-Palaeozoic Officer Basin. At Seven Mile Swamps in Australian Mining Corporation (AMC) 316-5 Drillhole where the unit is ~10m thick and silcrete capped, the formation to conformably overlie very thin limestone that is at present included in the Nullarbor Limestone (Benbow and Lindsay, 1988).  Here the basal sand is calcareous. In the type area, Yarle sandstone is overlain sharply but apparently conformably, by faminiferal packstone of the Nullarbor Limestone.  Silicification and ferruginisation has obscured the nature of the boundary.  The absence of a basal transgressive lag, seen elsewhere at the base of the nullarbor Limestone, and the occurrence of limestone clasts, supports a conformably relationship.  Conspicuous intertonguing of Yarle Sandstone and Nullarbor Limestone has not been observed and any intertonguing that may have existed is considered to have been largely removed by post-depositional erosion.  Also in the Yarle Lakes region, the formation is unconformably overlain Quaternary aoeolian sand of the Great Victoria Desert.  Where Yarle sandstone is not duricrust capped, the position of the upper boundary is difficult to judge because of reworking and Quaternary weathering.|14/AUG/08
26243|Yarle Sandstone|Age reasons|The presence of the large benthonic foraminifer Austrotrillina howchini and Marginopora vertbralis (the latter has been observed in the limestone clasts), indicates an age no older than earliest Miocene (Adams 1984).  An Early to early Middle Miocene age may be deduced from the age of the Nullarbor Limestone (Benbow and Lindsay, 188 and references therein). Lindsay (IN: Benbow and Lindsay, 1988) interprets an Early Miocene )Longfordian) age for the conformably underlying thin limestone at Seven Mile Swamps in AMC 316-5.|14/AUG/08
