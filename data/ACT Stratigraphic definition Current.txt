24186|Black Mountain Sandstone|Name source|Named after Black Mountain, Canberra, ACT (Opik 1958).|
24186|Black Mountain Sandstone|Unit history|Synonymy: none.|
24186|Black Mountain Sandstone|Type section locality|Black Mountain (Opik 1958). Reference section (Lat 35o 17'S Long 149o 06'E) in cuttings along access road to the summit of Black Mountain (Owen 1987).  Here the formation is exposed as an upward facing sequence of grey fine- to medium-grained quartz sandstone with subordinate grey shale interbeds showing sedimentary structures typical of proximal turbidite deposit.  Top and bottom of the formation not exposed.|
24186|Black Mountain Sandstone|Extent|Hills and ridges at Black Mountain, Jerrabomberra Hill, Ginninderra area and northwest Capital Hill.|
24186|Black Mountain Sandstone|Thickness range|Estimates are >800 m (Crook and others 1973) and >450 m (Henderson 1981).|
24186|Black Mountain Sandstone|Lithology|Thickly bedded, in places massive medium-grained sandstone in which siltstone and shale interbeds are more common lower in the sequence. Sedimentary structures include plane/cross/convolute laminations, load casts, flute moulds and slump units (Crook and other 1973).|
24186|Black Mountain Sandstone|Depositional environment|Marine - prograding turbidite fan complex deposited by eastward-flowing turbidity currents.|
24186|Black Mountain Sandstone|Relationships and boundaries|Base has gradational and conformable contact with State Circle Shale.  Topmost beds are now an erosion surface except for unconformable contact with late Silurian Camp Hill Sandstone (Opik 1958) - now obscured by Parliament House.|
24186|Black Mountain Sandstone|Age reasons|Unfossiliferous. Early Silurian (Late Llandovery) by stratigraphic superposition with underlying State Circle Shale.|
24186|Black Mountain Sandstone|Correlations|On similarity of lithofacies probably co-eval with Tidbinbilla Quartzite, Mundoonan Sandstone and uppermost beds of the Ryrie Formation and Murrumbateman Creek Formation.|
24208|Camp Hill Sandstone Member|Name source|Named after Camp Hill, in Canberra, ACT (Opik 1958).|
24208|Camp Hill Sandstone Member|Unit history|None.|
24208|Camp Hill Sandstone Member|Type section locality|A deep road cutting on State Circle on the southwest side of Camp Hill (Lat 35o 185'S Long 149o 07'E) - the member rests with marked unconformity on early Silurian State Circle Shale.  The sequence consists of a thin basal grit (approx. 10cm thick) overlain by thinly bedded multicoloured siltstone and sandstone. The top is not exposed.|
24208|Camp Hill Sandstone Member|Extent|Scattered outcrops in the central Canberra and Ginninderra areas; Murrumbateman Creek catchment and west of Queanbeyan.|
24208|Camp Hill Sandstone Member|Thickness range|Estimated thickness up to 60m (Hendersen 1981).|
24208|Camp Hill Sandstone Member|Lithology|Well-bedded sandstone and siltstone with thin shale partings.|
24208|Camp Hill Sandstone Member|Depositional environment|Shallow marine.|
24208|Camp Hill Sandstone Member|Relationships and boundaries|Overlies late Ordovician Pittman Formation and early Silurian State Circle Shale, Black Mountain Sandstone and Murrumbateman Creek Formation with major unconformity (Strusz and Henderson 1971, Crook and others 1973, Henderson 1978 and 1979).  The Camp Hill Sandstone passes gradationally upwards to mudstone and siltstone of the Canberra Formation. The top of the member is arbitrarily taken where mudstone dominates over sandstone.  It is the basal member of the Canberra Formation.|11/FEB/08
24208|Camp Hill Sandstone Member|Age reasons|Late Silurian (late Wenlock) based on the brachiopod Rhipidium (Berry and Boucot 1970).|
24208|Camp Hill Sandstone Member|Correlations|None.|
3447|Canberra Formation|Name source|From the current Canberra Group.|
3447|Canberra Formation|Type section locality|A fully representative type section is not available and much of the formation is not exposed. The basal part is well exposed at State Circle and Capital Circle, and a 300 m section near the top has been continuously cored in stratigraphic drillhole 145 (Henderson, 1978).|
3447|Canberra Formation|Extent|The unit (Strusz and Henderson, 1971) extends from Gungahlin through Canberra City to Fyshwick.|
3447|Canberra Formation|Thickness range|At least 1000 m. Full thickness not known, owing to faults of indeterminable displacement.|
3447|Canberra Formation|Lithology|Sandstone, siltstone, shale, mudstone, limestone, tuff (coarse and fine and pyroclastics?), ashstone, dacite (flows or pyroclastics?).|
3447|Canberra Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Overlies Black Mountain Sandstone, State Circle Shale and Pittman Formation unconformably. Overlain conformably by Ainslie Volcanics|
3447|Canberra Formation|Identifying features|Reason for nomenclature change: The original Canberra Group was defined by Opik (1954; 1958) as comprising three formations - the Turner Mudstone, the Riverside Formation and the City Hill Shale in ascending order. The Canberra Group was redefined in 1971 for the first edition of the 1:50 000 geological map and explanatory notes to include also the Camp Hill Sandstone (underlying the Turner Mudstone) and the St.Johns Church Beds (overlying the City Hill Shale). Subsequent mapping, drilling and palaeontological studies have now reached a stage where it can be argued that the lithological and faunal distinctions between the five formations now comprising the Canberra Group are insufficient to justify the existence of all these units as separate formations. It is therefore proposed that the name Canberra Group be changed to Canberra Formation as being more in keeping with the concept of a formation in the stratigraphic nomenclature guide.  Further extension of Canberra Formation: Recent mapping has shown that the Fairbairn Group (Opik, 1954; 1958) is a lateral equivalent of the upper part of the proposed Canberra Formation, and that it contains no significant lithological or faunal distinctions from the Canberra Formation. The lateral equivalence of the Canberra Formation and Fairbairn Group is supported by the observation from recent mapping that both units are conformably overlain by the Ainslie Volcanics. Opik divided the Fairbairn Group into four formations - the Molonglo Ford Hornfels, the Molonglo Sandstone, the Molonglo River Formation and the Mahon Formation. It is proposed that these formations be dispensed with as formal units, and that the Fairbairn Group be discorded as a separate entity and become part of the Canberra Formation.  Members of Canberra Formation:  Two rock units in the proposed Canberra Formation are regarded as being sufficiently distinctive to be retained as members. They are the Camp Hill Sandstone and the City Hill Shale. A third unit, the Narrabundah Ashstone (Opik, 1954; 1958) was originally regarded as belonging to the Ainslie Volcanics. Mapping at Fyshwick has recently shown that the ashstone is contained within the proposed Canberra Formation. It is therefore proposed that the Ashstone also be designated a member.|
3447|Canberra Formation|Age reasons|Middle to late Silurian from corals, brachiopods, trilobites, conodonts etc.|

4677|Copper Creek Shale|Name source|Derived from Copper Creek, a small tributary of the Molonglo River at Captains Flat (GR 206/584) on the Michelago 1:100 000 sheet area (Richardson 1979).|
4677|Copper Creek Shale|Unit history|Copper Creek beds (Glasson and Paine, 1965).|
4677|Copper Creek Shale|Type section locality|Designated as Copper Creek and an adjacent road cutting near Captains Falt Railway Station (GR 207/586) on the Michelago 1:100 000 sheet 8726 (Oldershaw 1965 and Richardson 1979).  Here the formation crops out as tightly folded beds of dark grey shale and siltstone with subordinate sandstone. On the Canberra 1:100 000 sheet 8727, a representative section is exposed in a road cutting at GR 160/710. Here similar rock types show sedimentary structures but the thickness is unclear as beds may be repeated in isoclinal folds.|
4677|Copper Creek Shale|Extent|Crops out poorly along the eastern edge of the Captains Flat Graben. Good exposures occur in the road and rail cuttings north of Captains Flat Mine. A few outcrops are found in Primose Valley (western limb of Captains Flat Graben).|
4677|Copper Creek Shale|Thickness range|Estimated as 60-150 m (Richardson 1979).|
4677|Copper Creek Shale|Lithology|Thin-bedded greyish-black shale, siltstone and sandstone with minor limestone and tuff. Discontinuous beds of quartzite and conglomerate at the base are representative of the Rutledge Quartzite Member.|
4677|Copper Creek Shale|Depositional environment|Marine turbidite facies - presence of limestone suggests locally shallow marine conditions.|
4677|Copper Creek Shale|Relationships and boundaries|The basal unit of the Copper Creek Shale (Rutledge Quartzite Member) rest unconformably on Late Ordovician rocks. Where this basal unit is absent the lower boundary is conjectural since the Copper Creek Shale is lithologically similar to the Ordovician rocks. Near Captains Flat on the Michelago 1:100 000 sheet the Copper Creek Shale passes gradationally up into the Kohinoor Volcanics (Richardson 1979).  Along Primrose Valley the Kohinoor Volcanics are absent and the Copper Creek Shale appears to dip disconformably beneath the Carwoola Formation. Along the eastern margin of the Captains Flat Graben the Copper Creek Shale is in contact with the Captains Flat Formation but the nature of this contact is conjectural.|
4677|Copper Creek Shale|Age reasons|Late Silurian (Ludlow?) based on rugose corals (Oldershaw 1965 and Talent and others, 1975).|
4677|Copper Creek Shale|Correlations|De Drack Formation (Huleatt 1971) and Cappannana Formation (Richardson 1979).|
24274|Federal Golf Course Tonalite|Name source|From Federal Golf Course between Garran and Hughes (GR917/880)|
24274|Federal Golf Course Tonalite|Unit history|None.|
24274|Federal Golf Course Tonalite|Type section locality|Federal Golf Course (Lat 35o 20'S Long 149o 06'E). A boulder of the tonalite can be seen near the course curator's depot about 100m northwest of the clubhouse.|
24274|Federal Golf Course Tonalite|Extent|Forms subdued topography and is poorly exposed over an area of about 1.0 km2 southwest of Red Hill.|
24274|Federal Golf Course Tonalite|Lithology|The tonalite consists of plagioclase, biotite, hornblende and late interstitial quartz with inclusions of plagioclase and mafics. The intrusion is considered as I-type based on presence of hornblende, a low isotopic strontium ratio and coincidence with a small aeromagnetic anomaly (BMR 1978).|
24274|Federal Golf Course Tonalite|Relationships and boundaries|No exposed contact. Detailed mapping shows the intrusion is discordant across the strike of the Yarralumla  Formation and lower units of the Deakin Volcanics.  Hornfelsing of the Yarralumla Formation along Red Hill ridge is probably due to this intrusion. The tonalite show similarities with tonalites in the Late Silurian I-type Jindabyne Suite (Hine and others, 1978).|
24274|Federal Golf Course Tonalite|Age reasons|A Rb-Sr age of 417+/-8Ma only indicates a minimum Late Silurian (Ludlovian) age for the tonalite.  However it appears to be younger than the Laidlow Volcanics (Rb-Sr age 421+/-2Ma given by Wyborn and others, 1982).|
8512|Hoskinstown Group|Name source|Named after the village of Hoskinstown at GR 225/775.|
8512|Hoskinstown Group|Unit history|Captains Flat Group (Glasson and Paine, 1965).|
8512|Hoskinstown Group|Constituents|Copper Creek Shale, Kohinoor Volcanics, Carwoola Formation, Captains Flat Formation.|
8512|Hoskinstown Group|Extent|The Hoskinstown Group underlies a broad topographic depression coinciding with the Captains Flat Graben. Formations within the group separate into two limbs southwest of Hoskinstown. In the western limb the sediments persist along the Primrose Valley Creek towards the Queanbeyan River while in the eastern limb they reach Captains Flat and contract as fault-bounded remnants as far south as the Bredbo River (Canberra and Michelage 1:100 000 sheets 8727 and 8726 respectively).|
8512|Hoskinstown Group|General description|Formations within the Hoskinstown Group have been described on the Michelago 1:100 000 sheet by Richardson (1979).|
8512|Hoskinstown Group|Thickness range|A minimum thickness of 4,000 m is given by  Oldershaw (1965) but this may reach 5,000m in the deeper axial portions of the Captains Flat Graben.|
8512|Hoskinstown Group|Depositional environment|Quiet, relatively shallow-water marine conditions.|
8512|Hoskinstown Group|Relationships and boundaries|The lower boundary is obscured by strong deformation, however conglomeratic beds at the base of the Copper Creek Shale (Rutledge Quartzite Member) are taken as evidence of a stratigraphic break with the underlying Ordovician rocks. The group is otherwise faulted against Ordovician rocks mainly along the Whiskers and Ballallaba Faults. The topmost units are truncated by the present erosion surface and by Cainozoic alluvium.|
8512|Hoskinstown Group|Age reasons|Late Silurian (Ludlow to Pridoli) - fossils are scarce.|
8512|Hoskinstown Group|Correlations|Facies equivalent of Mount Fairy Group - a shallow marine volcano-sedimentary sequences at the western edge of the Capertee Shelf. In part coeval with the Late Silurian Laidlow Volcanic Suite on the Canberra-Yass Shelf.|
24403|Mount Painter Volcanics|Name source|(Orig. Defn) From the current Mount Painter Porphyry (Opik, 1954; 1958).|
24403|Mount Painter Volcanics|Name source|Named after Mount Painter in Canberra (Opik 1958).|
24403|Mount Painter Volcanics|Unit history|(Orig. Defn) The present name, Mount Painter Porphyry, was given by Opik, based on a conclusion that the rock was essentially intrusive and more or less homogeneous. Recent studies both petrological and chemical have shown that the unit is essentially volcanic with several different components with slightly different petrological and chemical characteristics. No evidence has been found to suggest that the intrusive phases are other than minor. Moreover intrusive contacts have also been observed in association with other established volcanic units and not now regarded as sufficient evidence to override the petrologically volcanic feature.|
24403|Mount Painter Volcanics|Unit history|Mount Painter Porphyry (Opik 1958).|
24403|Mount Painter Volcanics|Type section locality|(Orig. Defn) Mount Painter, 6 km northwest of Canberra City, was designated by Opik as the type locality.|
24403|Mount Painter Volcanics|Type section locality|Area of pasture land and pine plantation bounded by the Winslade and Deakin Faults in the north and by the Molonglo River and Lake Burley Griffin in the south (Lat 35o 17'S Long 149' 03'E).|
24403|Mount Painter Volcanics|Description at type locality|The formation is exposed as boulders and tors of massive bluish-grey dacitic crystal tuff containing garnet with local development of agglomerate with lithic and compacted pumice. Top and bottom are not exposed.|
24403|Mount Painter Volcanics|Extent|A folded southeast - trending belt extending from Coppins Crossing towards Narrabundah and Jerrabomberra Creek. North of the Deakin Fault the formation extends from Gooromon Ponds Creek northwards to Yass.|
24403|Mount Painter Volcanics|Extent|(Orig. Defn) In belt extending from the Coppins Crossing area to Narrabundah.|
24403|Mount Painter Volcanics|Thickness range|(Orig. Defn) Unknown.|
24403|Mount Painter Volcanics|Thickness range|In Gooromon Ponds Creek area the estimate is 1000m.  South of the Deakin Fault estimates >1000m (Henderson 1981).|
24403|Mount Painter Volcanics|Lithology|Dark bluish-grey dacitic crystal tuff with prominent quartz and feldspar phenocrysts and also containing lithic xenoliths, dacitic autoliths and rafts of jasperised sediment. Minor interbeds of tuffaceous sandstone and siltstone.|
24403|Mount Painter Volcanics|Lithology|(Orig. Defn) Acid volcanics - dacite, tuff, minor lenses of ashstone and tuffaceous sediments.|
24403|Mount Painter Volcanics|Depositional environment|Subaerial.|
24403|Mount Painter Volcanics|Relationships and boundaries|Base not exposed owing to faults and poor exposure. In the Fairlight area the Mount Painter Volcanics may overlie the Walker Volcanics unconformably (Sufni Hakim 1985). Top is unconformable with trangressive Yarralumla Formation and Deakin Volcanics. North of Gooromon Ponds Creek there is a lower disconformable? boundary with Mount Ainslie Volcanics while the top is unconformable with the transgressive Yass Formation and Deakin Volcanics.|
24403|Mount Painter Volcanics|Relationships and boundaries|(Orig. Defn) The base of the unit is not exposed, owing to faults. The upper contact is poorly defined but probably interfingers with the lowest parts of the Deakin Volcanics and Yarralumla Formation. Some contacts appear to be intrusive, however petrological studies of thin sections representative of the great majority of the unit indicate a consistently volcanic texture.|
24403|Mount Painter Volcanics|Age reasons|Late Wenlock. Stratigraphically based on the Wenlock age deduced for the underlying Walker Volcanics (Chatterton and Campbell 1990, Strusz 1982) and the early Ludlow age of the overlying Yarralumla and Yass Formations (Strusz 1984, Wyborn and others 1982).|
24403|Mount Painter Volcanics|Age reasons|(Orig. Defn) Late Silurian or possibly late Middle Silurian by virtue of the relation to the fossiliferous late Silurian Yarralumla Formation. Also a possible tongue of the volcanics underlie fossiliferous late Middle Silurian shale and limestone 2 km northwest of Coppins Crossing.|
24403|Mount Painter Volcanics|Correlations|Unknown.|

24407|Mugga Mugga Porphyry Member|Name source|(Orig. Defn) From the current Mugga Mugga Porphyry.|
24407|Mugga Mugga Porphyry Member|Name source|Derived from Mount Mugga Mugga (813m) at GR 932/855.|
24407|Mugga Mugga Porphyry Member|Unit history|Synonymy: Mugga Series (Mahoney and Taylor 1913); Mugga Mugga Porphyry (Opik 1958, Strusz and Henderson 1971).|
24407|Mugga Mugga Porphyry Member|Unit history|(Orig. Defn) Recent mapping shows that the porphyry is not intrusive as previously interpreted (Opik, 1954; Strusz and Henderson, 1971) but is part of the Deakin Volcanics. Member status for the porphyry is therefore considered appropriate.|
24407|Mugga Mugga Porphyry Member|Type section locality|A large quarry near the summit of Mount Mugga Mugga (Lat 35o 22' S Long 149o 07'E) about 0.5 km south of Hindmarsh Drive (Owen 1987).|
24407|Mugga Mugga Porphyry Member|Type section locality|(Orig. Defn) Mugga Quarry|
24407|Mugga Mugga Porphyry Member|Description at type locality|The locality exposes approximately 90 m of well jointed, massive, blue-grey rhyodacite containing phenocrysts of quartz, plagioclase, pink potash feldspar and biotite. A faint compositional banding dips 20o SW.  The rock is veined by calcite, epidote and haematite.|
24407|Mugga Mugga Porphyry Member|Extent|Extends from Red Hill along Mugga Mugga Ridge and thence across Jerrabomberra Creek where is abuts against the Deakin Fault.|
24407|Mugga Mugga Porphyry Member|Extent|(Orig. Defn) The unit extends from Red Hill along the Mugga Mugga Ridge to Mugga Quarry and thence to the ACT/NSW border south of Queanbeyan.|
24407|Mugga Mugga Porphyry Member|Thickness range|Henderson (1981) gives 300 m, but locally the unit may reach 600 m.|
24407|Mugga Mugga Porphyry Member|Thickness range|(Orig. Defn) Ranges to about 400 m.|
24407|Mugga Mugga Porphyry Member|Lithology|(Orig. Defn) Rhyodacite|
24407|Mugga Mugga Porphyry Member|Lithology|A compact blue and mauve-grey porphyritic rhyodacite with the minor tuffaceous siltstone and shale.|
24407|Mugga Mugga Porphyry Member|Depositional environment|A lava flow extruded in a largely subaerial environment.|
24407|Mugga Mugga Porphyry Member|Relationships and boundaries|A member of the Deakin Volcanics. Conformably overlies the Yarralumla Formation and overlaps to lie disconformably on the Mount Painter Volcanics.  The porphyry is conformable with higher units in the Deakin Volcanics.|
24407|Mugga Mugga Porphyry Member|Relationships and boundaries|(Orig. Defn) Member of Deakin Volcanics. Conformably overlies Yarralumla Formation and conformably overlain by higher parts of the Deakin Volcanics. Distinguished in field by relatively coarse texture compared to overlying volcanics.|
24407|Mugga Mugga Porphyry Member|Age reasons|Early Ludlow based on its stratigraphic position above the Yarralumla Formation and base of the Deakin Volcanics. A radiometric age of 414+/-9Ma for the Mugga Mugga Porphyry Member relates to the intrusion of the younger Federal Golf Course tonalite which reset the isotopic chemistry of the porphyry.|
24407|Mugga Mugga Porphyry Member|Age reasons|(Orig. Defn) Late Silurian by virtue of its relation to the Late Silurian Yarralumla Formation.|
24407|Mugga Mugga Porphyry Member|Correlations|None.|

13560|Murrumbateman Creek Formation|Unit history|None|23/FEB/12
13560|Murrumbateman Creek Formation|Type section locality|Low hills and creeks east of Murrumbateman Creek and along Gundaroo - Murrumbateman road (Canberra 1:100 000 sheet 8727). Laminated mudstone and siltstone pass gradationally up into thick beds of sandstone.  The sequence is upward facing and deformed into tight southwest-trending folds.|
13560|Murrumbateman Creek Formation|Extent|Broad north-northeast-trending triangular belt extending about 1km north of Gunderoo-Murrumbateman road and south to 'Wantagong' homestead (GR 934/152).|

13560|Murrumbateman Creek Formation|Depositional environment|Marine-series of turbidite units deposited towards the distal edge of a submarine fan complex.|
13560|Murrumbateman Creek Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Base unconformable on the Late Ordovician Pittman Formation. Upper boundary not exposed but Henderson (1978) mapped basal sandstone of the Canberra Formation (Camp Hill Sandstone Member) in apparent unconformity with the Murrumbateman Creek Formation. Contacts otherwise faulted.|
13560|Murrumbateman Creek Formation|Age reasons|Early Silurian based on its stratigraphic position above the Pittman Formation and below the Canberra Formation.  Presence of laminated shale lithologically similar to Early Silurian State Circle Shale and similarly sandstone near the top typical of the Black Mountain Sandstone (Henderson 1978).|
24420|Narrabundah Ashstone Member|Name source|Named after the Canberra suburb of Narrabundah (Opik 1958).|
24420|Narrabundah Ashstone Member|Unit history|None.|
24420|Narrabundah Ashstone Member|Type section locality|A disused quarry in the suburb of Narrabundah ( LAt 35o 20'S Long 149o 9'E). BMR Strat. drillhole (C284) penetrated 30m of hard pale grey fine to medium-grained tuff below the floor of the quarry (Henderson 1983); this core is stored at the BMR Core and Cuttings Laboratory, Fyshwick, ACT.  Supplementary reference section: Exposed in roadcutting in Fairbairn Avenue (Lat 35o 18' Long 149o 10') - a westerly dipping sequence of tuffaceous sandstone and fine to medium grained tuff 56m thick. Top and bottom of unit not exposed.|
24420|Narrabundah Ashstone Member|Extent|Apart from a few scattered outcrops its distribution is known mainly from drillholes and trench excavations in the Fyshwick-Narrabundah area.|
24420|Narrabundah Ashstone Member|Thickness range|Estimated at up to 70m (Hendersen 1981).|
24420|Narrabundah Ashstone Member|Lithology|Fine-medium grained tuff with cherty laminations and pale brown tuffaceous sandstone.|
24420|Narrabundah Ashstone Member|Depositional environment|Volcaniclastic submarine mass-flow deposit laid down by turbidity currents in locally deeper parts of the Canberra-Yass Shelf (Owen and Cas, 1980).|
24420|Narrabundah Ashstone Member|Relationships and boundaries|A conformable member unit near the top of the Canberra Formation.|
24420|Narrabundah Ashstone Member|Age reasons|Unfossiliferous. Late Wenlock based on fossil and stratigraphic evidence for the Canberra Formation.|
24420|Narrabundah Ashstone Member|Correlations|Probably in part co-eval with volcanic units in the Canberra Formation north of the ACT-NSW border.|
20879|Yarralumla Formation|Name source|Named after the Canberra suburb of Yarralumla (Opik 1958).|
20879|Yarralumla Formation|Unit history|None.|
20879|Yarralumla Formation|Type section locality|Suburb of Yarralumla in and around the old Commonwealth brickpits (Lat 35o 18'S Long 149o 00'E). The formation is exposed as well bedded, olive-green calcareous mudstone and siltstone and some nodular dark-grey cherty limestone. The sequence is folded into open asymmetrical anticlines with shallow plunge southwards.  The locality is fossiliferous (Strusz 1980 and 1984).  Top and bottom of the formation are not exposed.|
20879|Yarralumla Formation|Extent|Two main outcrops belts; one extends from Red Hill Ridge to Lake Burley Griffin and the other from Woden Valley towards the Molonglo River.|
20879|Yarralumla Formation|Thickness range|Henderson (1981) gives an estimate of 100-300m.|
20879|Yarralumla Formation|Lithology|A clastic sequence of calcareous and tuffaceous mudstone and siltstone with minor interbeds of limestone and quartz sandstone.  Ashfall tuff and a few rhyodacitic flows were deposited coevally with the marine sequence.|14/NOV/13
20879|Yarralumla Formation|Depositional environment|Shallow marine with deltaic environments temporarily established at the basin margin. Coeval deposition of volcaniclastic sediments suggests sporadic volcanism at the centres close to the site of marine deposition.|
20879|Yarralumla Formation|Relationships and boundaries|Lower contact may be unconformable since the Yarralumla Formation appears to transgress the upper most beds of the Mount Painter Volcanics. Upper contact with Deakin Volcanics is complex. The Yarralumla Formation is overlain with apparent conformity by the Mugga Mugga Porphyry Member (basal member of the Deakin Volcanics) but elsewhere appears to pass gradationally up into the basal sediments and bedded pyroclastics of the Deakin Volcanics.|
20879|Yarralumla Formation|Age reasons|Early Ludlow from shelly marine fauna (Strusz 1984). Upper age limit constrained by contact metmorphism attributed to the tonalite intrusion which gives a Ludlovian radiometric date of 417+/-8Ma.|
20879|Yarralumla Formation|Correlations|Barrendella Shale (Opik 1958); Yass Formation (Owen and Cas 1980).|
