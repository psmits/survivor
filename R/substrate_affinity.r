#' Calculate substrate affinity
#'
#' Substrate affinity is a property of an organism that is defined based 
#' on the prevelance of a particular substrate over others. The exact cut-off 
#' for declaring one substrate perfered over another, or a ``mixed'' solution, 
#' has varied between studies. Here, the percentage is user defined.
#'
#' @param substrate vector of all substrates where a taxon is observed.
#' @param level cut-off for declaring ``preference''. numeric value between 0 and 1.
